| **[On the Synthetic Channels in Polar Codes over Binary-Input Discrete Memoryless Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04163v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Polar codes introduced by Arikan in 2009 are the first code family achieving the capacity of binary-input discrete memoryless channels (BIDMCs) with low-complexity encoding and decoding. Identifying unreliable synthetic channels in polar code construction is crucial. Currently, because of the large size of the output alphabets of synthetic channels, there is no effective approach to evaluate their reliability, except in the case that the underlying channels are binary erasure channels. This paper defines equivalence and symmetry based on the likelihood ratio profile of BIDMCs and characterizes symmetric BIDMCs as random switching channels (RSCs) of binary symmetric channels. By converting the generation of synthetic channels in polar code construction into algebraic operations on underlying channels, some compact representations of RSCs for these synthetic channels are derived. Moreover, a lower bound for the average number of elements that possess the same likelihood ratio within the output alphabet of any synthetic channel generated in polar codes is also derived.</p></details> |  |

We also determine the parity check matrices for these codes. Using the connection of MDS codes with arcs in finite projective spaces, we give a new characterization of o-monomials.</p></details> |  |
| **[AG Codes Achieve List-decoding Capacity over Constant-sized Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12898v3)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recently-emerging field of higher order MDS codes has sought to unify a number of concepts in coding theory. Such areas captured by higher order MDS codes include maximally recoverable (MR) tensor codes, codes with optimal list-decoding guarantees, and codes with constrained generator matrices (as in the GM-MDS theorem). By proving these equivalences, Brakensiek-Gopi-Makam showed the existence of optimally list-decodable Reed-Solomon codes over exponential sized fields. Building on this, recent breakthroughs by Guo-Zhang and Alrabiah-Guruswami-Li have shown that randomly punctured Reed-Solomon codes achieve list-decoding capacity (which is a relaxation of optimal list-decodability) over linear size fields. We extend these works by developing a formal theory of relaxed higher order MDS codes. In particular, we show that there are two inequivalent relaxations which we call lower and upper relaxations. The lower relaxation is equivalent to relaxed optimal list-decodable codes and the upper relaxation is equivalent to relaxed MR tensor codes with a single parity check per column. We then generalize the techniques of GZ and AGL to show that both these relaxations can be constructed over constant size fields by randomly puncturing suitable algebraic-geometric codes. For this, we crucially use the generalized GM-MDS theorem for polynomial codes recently proved by Brakensiek-Dhar-Gopi. We obtain the following corollaries from our main result. First, randomly punctured AG codes of rate $R$ achieve list-decoding capacity with list size $O(1/\epsilon)$ and field size $\exp(O(1/\epsilon^2))$. Prior to this work, AG codes were not even known to achieve list-decoding capacity. Second, by randomly puncturing AG codes, we can construct relaxed MR tensor codes with a single parity check per column over constant-sized fields, whereas (non-relaxed) MR tensor codes require exponential field size.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, to appear in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |
| **[Generalized GM-MDS: Polynomial Codes are Higher Order MDS](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.12888v3)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The GM-MDS theorem, conjectured by Dau-Song-Dong-Yuen and proved by Lovett and Yildiz-Hassibi, shows that the generator matrices of Reed-Solomon codes can attain every possible configuration of zeros for an MDS code. The recently emerging theory of higher order MDS codes has connected the GM-MDS theorem to other important properties of Reed-Solomon codes, including showing that Reed-Solomon codes can achieve list decoding capacity, even over fields of size linear in the message length. A few works have extended the GM-MDS theorem to other families of codes, including Gabidulin and skew polynomial codes. In this paper, we generalize all these previous results by showing that the GM-MDS theorem applies to any polynomial code, i.e., a code where the columns of the generator matrix are obtained by evaluating linearly independent polynomials at different points. We also show that the GM-MDS theorem applies to dual codes of such polynomial codes, which is non-trivial since the dual of a polynomial code may not be a polynomial code. More generally, we show that GM-MDS theorem also holds for algebraic codes (and their duals) where columns of the generator matrix are chosen to be points on some irreducible variety which is not contained in a hyperplane through the origin. Our generalization has applications to constructing capacity-achieving list-decodable codes as shown in a follow-up work by Brakensiek-Dhar-Gopi-Zhang, where it is proved that randomly punctured algebraic-geometric (AG) codes achieve list-decoding capacity over constant-sized fields.</p></details> | 36 pages |
| **[Generating Automotive Code: Large Language Models for Software Development and Verification in Safety-Critical Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04038v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing safety-critical automotive software presents significant challenges due to increasing system complexity and strict regulatory demands. This paper proposes a novel framework integrating Generative Artificial Intelligence (GenAI) into the Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC). The framework uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate code generation in languages such as C++, incorporating safety-focused practices such as static verification, test-driven development and iterative refinement. A feedback-driven pipeline ensures the integration of test, simulation and verification for compliance with safety standards. The framework is validated through the development of an Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) system. Comparative benchmarking of LLMs ensures optimal model selection for accuracy and reliability. Results demonstrate that the framework enables automatic code generation while ensuring compliance with safety-critical requirements, systematically integrating GenAI into automotive software engineering. This work advances the use of AI in safety-critical domains, bridging the gap between state-of-the-art generative models and real-world safety requirements.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages; Accepted for publication at the 36th IEEE Intelligent Vehicles Symposium (IV), Cluj-Napoca, Romania, June 22-25, 2025</p></details> |
| **[CETBench: A Novel Dataset constructed via Transformations over Programs for Benchmarking LLMs for Code-Equivalence Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04019v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have been extensively used for the task of automated code generation. In this work, we examine the applicability of LLMs for the related but relatively unexplored task of code-equivalence checking, i.e., given two programs, whether they are functionally equivalent or not. This is an important problem since benchmarking code equivalence can play a critical role in evaluating LLM capabilities for tasks such as code re-writing and code translation. Towards this end, we present CETBench - Code Equivalence with Transformations Benchmark, constructed via a repository of programs, where two programs in the repository may be solving the same or different tasks. Each instance in our dataset is obtained by taking a pair of programs in the repository and applying a random series of pre-defined code transformations, resulting in (non-)equivalent pairs. Our analysis on this dataset reveals a surprising finding that very simple code transformations in the underlying pair of programs can result in a significant drop in performance of SOTA LLMs for the task of code-equivalence checking. To remedy this, we present a simple fine-tuning-based approach to boost LLM performance on the transformed pairs of programs. Our approach for dataset generation is generic, and can be used with repositories with varying program difficulty levels and allows for applying varying numbers as well as kinds of transformations. In our experiments, we perform ablations over the difficulty level of original programs, as well as the kind of transformations used in generating pairs for equivalence checking. Our analysis presents deep insights into the working of LLMs for the task of code-equivalence, and points to the fact that they may still be far from what could be termed as a semantic understanding of the underlying code.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisCoder: Fine-Tuning LLMs for Executable Python Visualization Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03930v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with visualization tasks like plotting diagrams, charts, where success depends on both code correctness and visual semantics. Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Code Customization with Visual Results: A Benchmark on TikZ](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04670v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of AI-based code generation, customizing existing code out of natural language instructions to modify visual results -such as figures or images -has become possible, promising to reduce the need for deep programming expertise. However, even experienced developers can struggle with this task, as it requires identifying relevant code regions (feature location), generating valid code variants, and ensuring the modifications reliably align with user intent. In this paper, we introduce vTikZ, the first benchmark designed to evaluate the ability of Large Language Models (LLMs) to customize code while preserving coherent visual outcomes. Our benchmark consists of carefully curated vTikZ editing scenarios, parameterized ground truths, and a reviewing tool that leverages visual feedback to assess correctness. Empirical evaluation with stateof-the-art LLMs shows that existing solutions struggle to reliably modify code in alignment with visual intent, highlighting a gap in current AI-assisted code editing approaches. We argue that vTikZ opens new research directions for integrating LLMs with visual feedback mechanisms to improve code customization tasks in various domains beyond TikZ, including image processing, art creation, Web design, and 3D modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[The equivalent condition for GRL codes to be MDS, AMDS or self-dual](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03874v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is well-known that MDS, AMDS or self-dual codes have good algebraic properties, and are applied in communication systems, data storage, quantum codes, and so on. In this paper, we focus on a class of generalized Roth-Lempel linear codes, and give an equivalent condition for them or their dual to be non-RS MDS, AMDS or non-RS self-dual and some corresponding examples.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[On the class of coding optimality of human languages and the origins of Zipf's law](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20015v3)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Here we present a new class of optimality for coding systems. Members of that class are displaced linearly from optimal coding and thus exhibit Zipf's law, namely a power-law distribution of frequency ranks. Within that class, Zipf's law, the size-rank law and the size-probability law form a group-like structure. We identify human languages that are members of the class. All languages showing sufficient agreement with Zipf's law are potential members of the class. In contrast, there are communication systems in other species that cannot be members of that class for exhibiting an exponential distribution instead but dolphins and humpback whales might. We provide a new insight into plots of frequency versus rank in double logarithmic scale. For any system, a straight line in that scale indicates that the lengths of optimal codes under non-singular coding and under uniquely decodable encoding are displaced by a linear function whose slope is the exponent of Zipf's law. For systems under compression and constrained to be uniquely decodable, such a straight line may indicate that the system is coding close to optimality. We provide support for the hypothesis that Zipf's law originates from compression and define testable conditions for the emergence of Zipf's law in compressing systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Codes on Weighted Projective Planes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11968v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We comprehensively study weighted projective Reed-Muller (WPRM) codes on weighted projective planes $\mathbb{P}(1,a,b)$. We provide the universal Gr\"obner basis for the vanishing ideal of the set $Y$ of $\mathbb{F}_q$--rational points of $\mathbb{P}(1,a,b)$ to get the dimension of the code. We determine the regularity set of $Y$ using a novel combinatorial approach. We employ footprint techniques to compute the minimum distance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Additive codes from linear codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03805v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce two constructions of additive codes over finite fields. Both constructions start with a linear code over a field with $q$ elements and give additive codes over the field with $q^h$ elements whose minimum distance is demonstrably good.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Uniform and Binary-coding Quantization for Accurate Compression of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03781v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can we quantize large language models while preserving accuracy? Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Binary-coding quantization (BCQ) and uniform quantization (UQ) are promising quantization schemes that have strong expressiveness and optimizability, respectively. However, neither scheme leverages both advantages. In this paper, we propose UniQuanF (Unified Quantization with Flexible Mapping), an accurate quantization method for LLMs. UniQuanF harnesses both strong expressiveness and optimizability by unifying the flexible mapping technique in UQ and non-uniform quantization levels of BCQ. We propose unified initialization, and local and periodic mapping techniques to optimize the parameters in UniQuanF precisely. After optimization, our unification theorem removes computational and memory overhead, allowing us to utilize the superior accuracy of UniQuanF without extra deployment costs induced by the unification. Experimental results demonstrate that UniQuanF outperforms existing UQ and BCQ methods, achieving up to 4.60% higher accuracy on GSM8K benchmark.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main Track |
| **[GenTT: Generate Vectorized Codes for General Tensor Permutation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03686v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor permutation is a fundamental operation widely applied in AI, tensor networks, and related fields. However, it is extremely complex, and different shapes and permutation maps can make a huge difference. SIMD permutation began to be studied in 2006, but the best method at that time was to split complex permutations into multiple simple permutations to do SIMD, which might increase the complexity for very complex permutations. Subsequently, as tensor contraction gained significant attention, researchers explored structured permutations associated with tensor contraction. Progress on general permutations has been limited, and with increasing SIMD bit widths, achieving efficient performance for these permutations has become increasingly challenging. We propose a SIMD permutation toolkit, \system, that generates optimized permutation code for arbitrary instruction sets, bit widths, tensor shapes, and permutation patterns, while maintaining low complexity. In our experiments, \system is able to achieve up to $38\times$ speedup for special cases and $5\times$ for general gases compared to Numpy.</p></details> | 11 pages, 9 figures |
| **[VecTrans: Enhancing Compiler Auto-Vectorization through LLM-Assisted Code Transformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19449v3)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auto-vectorization is a fundamental optimization for modern compilers to exploit SIMD parallelism. However, state-of-the-art approaches still struggle to handle intricate code patterns, often requiring manual hints or domain-specific expertise. Large language models (LLMs), with their ability to capture intricate patterns, provide a promising solution, yet their effective application in compiler optimizations remains an open challenge due to issues such as hallucinations and a lack of domain-specific reasoning. In this paper, we present VecTrans, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to enhance compiler-based code vectorization. VecTrans first employs compiler analysis to identify potentially vectorizable code regions. It then utilizes an LLM to refactor these regions into patterns that are more amenable to the compilers auto-vectorization. To ensure semantic correctness, VecTrans further integrates a hybrid validation mechanism at the intermediate representation (IR) level. With the above efforts, VecTrans combines the adaptability of LLMs with the precision of compiler vectorization, thereby effectively opening up the vectorization opportunities. experimental results show that among all TSVC functions unvectorizable by GCC, ICC, Clang, and BiSheng Compiler, VecTrans achieves an geomean speedup of 1.77x and successfully vectorizes 24 of 51 test cases. This marks a significant advancement over state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining a cost efficiency of $0.012 per function optimization for LLM API usage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Compression Really Linear with Code Intelligence?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11441v3)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the relationship between data compression and the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial, especially in specialized domains like code intelligence. Prior work posited a linear relationship between compression and general intelligence. However, it overlooked the multifaceted nature of code that encompasses diverse programming languages and tasks, and struggled with fair evaluation of modern Code LLMs. We address this by evaluating a diverse array of open-source Code LLMs on comprehensive multi-language, multi-task code benchmarks. To address the challenge of efficient and fair evaluation of pre-trained LLMs' code intelligence, we introduce \textit{Format Annealing}, a lightweight, transparent training methodology designed to assess the intrinsic capabilities of these pre-trained models equitably. Compression efficacy, measured as bits-per-character (BPC), is determined using a novel, large-scale, and previously unseen code validation set derived from GitHub. Our empirical results reveal a fundamental logarithmic relationship between measured code intelligence and BPC. This finding refines prior hypotheses of linearity, which we suggest are likely observations of the logarithmic curve's tail under specific, limited conditions. Our work provides a more nuanced understanding of compression's role in developing code intelligence and contributes a robust evaluation framework in the code domain.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[Across Programming Language Silos: A Study on Cross-Lingual Retrieval-augmented Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03535v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current research on large language models (LLMs) with retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) mainly focuses on single-language settings, leaving cross-lingual effectiveness and security unexplored. Multi-lingual RACG systems are valuable for migrating code-bases across programming languages (PLs), yet face risks from error (e.g. adversarial data corruption) propagation in cross-lingual transfer. We construct a dataset spanning 13 PLs with nearly 14k instances to explore utility and robustness of multi-lingual RACG systems. Our investigation reveals four key insights: (1) Effectiveness: multi-lingual RACG significantly enhances multi-lingual code LLMs generation; (2) Inequality: Java demonstrate superior cross-lingual utility over Python in RACG; (3) Robustness: Adversarial attacks degrade performance significantly in mono-lingual RACG but show mitigated impacts in cross-lingual scenarios; Counterintuitively, perturbed code may improve RACG in cross-lingual scenarios; (4) Specialization: Domain-specific code retrievers outperform significantly general text retrievers. These findings establish foundation for developing effective and secure multi-lingual code assistants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Seed-Coder: Let the Code Model Curate Data for Itself](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03524v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code data in large language model (LLM) pretraining is recognized crucial not only for code-related tasks but also for enhancing general intelligence of LLMs. Current open-source LLMs often heavily rely on human effort to produce their code pretraining data, such as employing hand-crafted filtering rules tailored to individual programming languages, or using human-annotated data to train quality filters. However, these approaches are inherently limited in scalability, prone to subjective biases, and costly to extend and maintain across diverse programming languages. To address these challenges, we introduce Seed-Coder, a series of open-source LLMs comprising base, instruct and reasoning models of 8B size, minimizing human involvement in data construction. Our code pretraining data is produced by a model-centric data pipeline, which predominantly leverages LLMs for scoring and filtering code data. The instruct model is further trained via supervised fine-tuning and preference optimization, and the reasoning model leverages Long-Chain-of-Thought (LongCoT) reinforcement learning to improve multi-step code reasoning. Seed-Coder achieves state-of-the-art results among open-source models of similar size and even surpasses some much larger models, demonstrating superior performance in code generation, code completion, code editing, code reasoning, and software engineering tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing the Robustness of LLM-Generated Code: Empirical Study and Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20197v3)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the robustness of code generated by large language models (LLMs) is crucial for real-world reliability. However, existing evaluations predominantly focus on correctness, often neglecting key robustness concerns such as missing input validation and insufficient error handling. In this paper, we present the first empirical study on the robustness of LLM-generated code. We introduce novel robustness metrics and analyze four state-of-the-art code LLMs, revealing that, on average, 43.1% of their generated code is less robust than human-written counterparts. Notably, over 90% of robustness deficiencies stem from missing conditional checks, with 70% of these omissions occurring in the first line of code. Additionally, in 69% of cases where a conditional statement is necessary but absent, the "if" token still ranks third or higher in the model's predicted token probabilities, indicating an implicit recognition of control structures. Building on these findings, we propose RobGen, a framework designed to enhance code robustness without requiring model retraining. RobGen leverages two model-agnostic techniques: RobGen-Adj, which dynamically adjusts token probabilities during decoding to encourage the inclusion of control structures, and RobGen-Ins, which improves generated code by inserting missing conditionals after generation. Experimental results demonstrate that RobGen reduces the proportion of less robust model-generated code by 20.0%, significantly enhancing code reliability across diverse tasks. As a lightweight and adaptable solution, RobGen effectively mitigates robustness challenges in LLM-generated code. All code and data are available at https://github.com/SYSUSELab/RobGen.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Dynamic Benchmarking of Reasoning Capabilities in Code Large Language Models Under Data Contamination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04149v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of code largelanguage models underscores the need for effective and transparent benchmarking of their reasoning capabilities. However, the current benchmarking approach heavily depends on publicly available, human-created datasets. The widespread use of these fixed benchmark datasets makes the benchmarking process to be static and thus particularly susceptible to data contamination, an unavoidable consequence of the extensive data collection processes used to train Code LLMs. Existing approaches that address data contamination often suffer from human effort limitations and imbalanced problem complexity. To tackle these challenges, we propose \tool, a novel benchmarking suite for evaluating Code LLMs under potential data contamination. Given a seed programming problem, \tool employs multiple agents to extract and modify the context without altering the core logic, generating semantically equivalent variations. We introduce a dynamic data generation methods and conduct empirical studies on two seed datasets across 21 Code LLMs. Results show that \tool effectively benchmarks reasoning capabilities under contamination risks while generating diverse problem sets to ensure consistent and reliable evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted to ICML 2025.

| **[The Stress of Improvisation: Instructors' Perspectives on Live Coding in Programming Classes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03402v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Live coding is a pedagogical technique in which an instructor writes and executes code in front of students to impart skills like incremental development and debugging. Although live coding offers many benefits, instructors face many challenges in the classroom, like cognitive challenges and psychological stress, most of which have yet to be formally studied. To understand the obstacles faced by instructors in CS classes, we conducted (1) a formative interview with five teaching assistants in exercise sessions and (2) a contextual inquiry study with four lecturers for large-scale classes. We found that the improvisational and unpredictable nature of live coding makes it difficult for instructors to manage their time and keep students engaged, resulting in more mental stress than presenting static slides. We discussed opportunities for augmenting existing IDEs and presentation setups to help enhance live coding experience.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Modelling the Effects of Hearing Loss on Neural Coding in the Auditory Midbrain with Variational Conditioning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03088v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The mapping from sound to neural activity that underlies hearing is highly non-linear. The first few stages of this mapping in the cochlea have been modelled successfully, with biophysical models built by hand and, more recently, with DNN models trained on datasets simulated by biophysical models. Modelling the auditory brain has been a challenge because central auditory processing is too complex for models to be built by hand, and datasets for training DNN models directly have not been available. Recent work has taken advantage of large-scale high resolution neural recordings from the auditory midbrain to build a DNN model of normal hearing with great success. But this model assumes that auditory processing is the same in all brains, and therefore it cannot capture the widely varying effects of hearing loss. We propose a novel variational-conditional model to learn to encode the space of hearing loss directly from recordings of neural activity in the auditory midbrain of healthy and noise exposed animals. With hearing loss parametrised by only 6 free parameters per animal, our model accurately predicts 62\% of the explainable variance in neural responses from normal hearing animals and 68% for hearing impaired animals, within a few percentage points of state of the art animal specific models. We demonstrate that the model can be used to simulate realistic activity from out of sample animals by fitting only the learned conditioning parameters with Bayesian optimisation, achieving crossentropy loss within 2% of the optimum in 15-30 iterations. Including more animals in the training data slightly improved the performance on unseen animals. This model will enable future development of parametrised hearing loss compensation models trained to directly restore normal neural coding in hearing impaired brains, which can be quickly fitted for a new user by human in the loop optimisation.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Coding Agents with Multimodal Browsing are Generalist Problem Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03011v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern human labor is characterized by specialization; we train for years and develop particular tools that allow us to perform well across a variety of tasks. In addition, AI agents have been specialized for domains such as software engineering, web navigation, and workflow automation. However, this results in agents that are good for one thing but fail to generalize beyond their intended scope. One reason for this is that agent developers provide a highly specialized set of tools or make architectural decisions optimized for a specific use case or benchmark. In this work, we ask the question: what is the minimal set of general tools that can be used to achieve high performance across a diverse set of tasks? Our answer is OpenHands-Versa, a generalist agent built with a modest number of general tools: code editing and execution, web search, as well as multimodal web browsing and file access. Importantly, OpenHands-Versa demonstrates superior or competitive performance over leading specialized agents across three diverse and challenging benchmarks: SWE-Bench Multimodal, GAIA, and The Agent Company, outperforming the best-performing previously published results with absolute improvements in success rate of 9.1, 1.3, and 9.1 points respectively. Further, we show how existing state-of-the-art multi-agent systems fail to generalize beyond their target domains. These results demonstrate the feasibility of developing a generalist agent to solve diverse tasks and establish OpenHands-Versa as a strong baseline for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coded Many-User Multiple Access via Approximate Message Passing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.05625v5)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider communication over the Gaussian multiple-access channel in the regime where the number of users grows linearly with the codelength. In this regime, schemes based on sparse superposition coding can achieve a near-optimal tradeoff between spectral efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio. However, these schemes are feasible only for small values of user payload. This paper investigates efficient schemes for larger user payloads, focusing on coded CDMA schemes where each user's information is encoded via a linear code before being modulated with a signature sequence. We propose an efficient approximate message passing (AMP) decoder that can be tailored to the structure of the linear code, and provide an exact asymptotic characterization of its performance. Based on this result, we consider a decoder that integrates AMP and belief propagation and characterize its tradeoff between spectral efficiency and signal-to-noise ratio, for a given target error rate. Simulation results show that the decoder achieves state-of-the-art performance at finite lengths, with a coded CDMA scheme defined using LDPC codes and a spatially coupled matrix of signature sequences.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 8 figures.

| **[A Preference-Driven Methodology for High-Quality Solidity Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03006v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in generating functionally correct Solidity code, they continue to face critical challenges in producing gas-efficient and secure code, which are critical requirements for real-world smart contract deployment. Although recent advances leverage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for code preference alignment, existing approaches treat functional correctness, gas optimization, and security as independent objectives, resulting in contracts that may achieve operational soundness but suffer from prohibitive execution costs or dangerous vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, we propose PrefGen, a novel framework that extends standard DPO beyond human preferences to incorporate quantifiable blockchain-specific metrics, enabling holistic multi-objective optimization specifically tailored for smart contract generation. Our framework introduces a comprehensive evaluation methodology with four complementary metrics: Pass@k (functional correctness), Compile@k (syntactic correctness), Gas@k (gas efficiency), and Secure@k (security assessment), providing rigorous multi-dimensional contract evaluation. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that PrefGen significantly outperforms existing approaches across all critical dimensions, achieving 66.7% Pass@5, 58.9% Gas@5, and 62.5% Secure@5, while generating production-ready smart contracts that are functionally correct, cost-efficient, and secure.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we reveal a novel provider bias in LLMs: without explicit directives, these models show systematic preferences for services from specific providers in their recommendations (e.g., favoring Google Cloud over Microsoft Azure). To systematically investigate this bias, we develop an automated pipeline to construct the dataset, incorporating 6 distinct coding task categories and 30 real-world application scenarios. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study of provider bias in LLM code generation across seven state-of-the-art LLMs, utilizing approximately 500 million tokens (equivalent to $5,000+ in computational costs). Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit significant provider preferences, predominantly favoring services from Google and Amazon, and can autonomously modify input code to incorporate their preferred providers without users' requests. Such a bias holds far-reaching implications for market dynamics and societal equilibrium, potentially contributing to digital monopolies. It may also deceive users and violate their expectations, leading to various consequences. We call on the academic community to recognize this emerging issue and develop effective evaluation and mitigation methods to uphold AI security and fairness.</p></details> | 27 pages, 13 figures |

Meanwhile, the widespread adoption of Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised concerns regarding data contamination and its potential impact on model performance evaluation. This paper presents a systematic empirical study to investigate the fine-grained data contamination on code intelligence tasks. Our study involves diverse representative PLMs, namely RoBERTa and GPT-2, and LLMs, namely LLaMA and StarCoder, covering three major tasks: code translation, code generation, and code summarization. We categorize contamination scenarios into four types according to the code intelligence practice, namely input-only, output-only, unpaired, and paired contamination settings, and construct corresponding experimental and control groups for exploration. Experimental results show that, under the pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference paradigm adopted by PLMs, even deliberately injecting paired contamination does not lead to significant performance overestimation. But direct inference or small-scale fine-tuning uncovers the contamination effects. In contrast, LLMs with pre-training and inference paradigm are significantly affected by the paired contamination. Apart from the above, other contamination scenarios have no impact on both PLMs and LLMs. Our findings challenge the conventional belief that contamination inevitably leads to performance overestimation, providing new insights into the evaluation and deployment of code intelligence models.</p></details> |  |

Accelerating Code Editing via Edit-Oriented Speculative Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02780v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code editing, substantially enhancing software development productivity. However, the inherent complexity of code editing tasks forces existing approaches to rely on LLMs' autoregressive end-to-end generation, where decoding speed plays a critical role in efficiency. While inference acceleration techniques like speculative decoding are applied to improve the decoding efficiency, these methods fail to account for the unique characteristics of code editing tasks where changes are typically localized and existing code segments are reused. To address this limitation, we propose EfficientEdit, a novel method that improves LLM-based code editing efficiency through two key mechanisms based on speculative decoding: (1) effective reuse of original code segments while identifying potential edit locations, and (2) efficient generate edit content via high-quality drafts from edit-oriented draft models and a dynamic verification mechanism that balances quality and acceleration. Experimental results show that EfficientEdit can achieve up to 10.38$\times$ and 13.09$\times$ speedup compared to standard autoregressive decoding in CanItEdit and CodeIF-Bench, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art inference acceleration approaches by up to 90.6%.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a novel test-time iterative optimization framework to address this, employing a closed-loop system where LLMs iteratively refine code based on empirical performance feedback from an execution sandbox. We explore three training strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on our Venus dataset and the APPS benchmark show that SFT and DPO rapidly saturate in efficiency gains. In contrast, GRPO, using reinforcement learning (RL) with execution feedback, continuously optimizes code performance, significantly boosting both pass@1 (from 47% to 62%) and the likelihood of outperforming human submissions in efficiency (from 31% to 45%). Our work demonstrates effective test-time code efficiency improvement and critically reveals the power of RL in teaching LLMs to truly self-improve code efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeDPO: Aligning Code Models with Self Generated and Verified Source Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05605v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation models have shown significant potential for programming tasks. However, existing training methods like supervised fine-tuning face key limitations: they do not effectively teach models to prioritize correct over incorrect solutions in ambiguous situations, nor do they effectively optimize the runtime efficiency of the generated code. To address these challenges, we propose CodeDPO, a framework that integrates preference learning into code generation to improve two key code preference factors: code correctness and efficiency. CodeDPO employs a novel dataset construction method, utilizing a self-generation-and-validation mechanism that simultaneously generates and evaluates code and test cases. The underlying assumption is that test cases executable by multiple code snippets provide more reliable validation, and code that passes more tests is more likely to be correct. Through this self-validation process, our PageRank-inspired algorithm iteratively updates the ranking score of each code snippet, ultimately creating a code preference optimization dataset based on correctness and efficiency. CodeDPO is flexible and scalable, generating diverse preference optimization data without depending on external resources. Through comprehensive evaluations of five widely used benchmarks, CodeDPO demonstrates significant improvements in correctness and efficiency compared to existing methods. Our experiments prove that CodeDPO enhances the capabilities of LLMs in code generation and provides a robust foundation for conducting code preference optimization in more complex and challenging real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera Ready version for ACL 2025 (main)</p></details> |

However, the challenge of generating accurate and reliable code persists due to the highly complex and long-reasoning nature of the task. Even state-of-the-art models often fail in code generation due to small errors, which can drastically affect the overall functionality of code. Our study identifies that current models tend to produce errors concentrated at specific error-prone points, which significantly impacts the accuracy of the generated code. To address this issue, we introduce Focused-DPO, a framework that enhances code generation by directing preference optimization towards these critical error-prone areas. This approach builds on Direct Preference Optimization, emphasizing accuracy in parts prone to errors. Additionally, we develop a method called Error-Point Identification, which constructs a dataset that targets these problematic points without requiring costly human annotations. Our experiments on benchmarks such as HumanEval(+), MBPP(+), and LiveCodeBench demonstrate that Focused-DPO significantly improves the precision and reliability of code generation, reducing common errors and enhancing overall code quality. By focusing on error-prone points, Focused-DPO advances the accuracy and functionality of model-generated code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera Ready version for ACL 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |
| **[An Effective Approach to Embedding Source Code by Combining Large Language and Sentence Embedding Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14644v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced artificial intelligence (AI) in software engineering (SE), with source code embeddings playing a crucial role in tasks such as source code clone detection and source code clustering. However, existing methods for source code embedding, including those based on LLMs, often rely on costly supervised training or fine-tuning for domain adaptation. This paper proposes a novel approach to embedding source code by combining large language and sentence embedding models. This approach attempts to eliminate the need for task-specific training or fine-tuning and to effectively address the issue of erroneous information commonly found in LLM-generated outputs. To evaluate the performance of our proposed approach, we conducted a series of experiments on three datasets with different programming languages by considering various LLMs and sentence embedding models. The experimental results have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of our approach over the state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches, such as SourcererCC, Code2vec, InferCode, TransformCode, and LLM2Vec. Our findings highlight the potential of our approach to advance the field of SE by providing robust and efficient solutions for source code embedding tasks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce ResearchCodeBench, a benchmark of 212 coding challenges that evaluates LLMs' ability to translate cutting-edge ML contributions from top 2024-2025 research papers into executable code. We assessed 30+ proprietary and open-source LLMs, finding that even the best models correctly implement less than 40% of the code. We find Gemini-2.5-Pro-Preview to perform best at 37.3% success rate, with O3 (High) and O4-mini (High) following behind at 32.3% and 30.8% respectively. We present empirical findings on performance comparison, contamination, and error patterns. By providing a rigorous and community-driven evaluation platform, ResearchCodeBench enables continuous understanding and advancement of LLM-driven innovation in research code generation.</p></details> |  |

Source-to-source code transformations, which include control flow and datapath transformations, have been widely used in High-Level Synthesis (HLS) and compiler optimization. While researchers actively investigate methods to improve performance with source-to-source code transformations, they often overlook the significance of verifying their correctness. Current tools cannot provide a holistic verification of these transformations. This paper introduces HEC, a framework for equivalence checking that leverages the e-graph data structure to comprehensively verify functional equivalence between programs. HEC utilizes the MLIR as its frontend and integrates MLIR into the e-graph framework. Through the combination of dynamic and static e-graph rewriting, HEC facilitates the validation of comprehensive code transformations. We demonstrate effectiveness of HEC on PolyBenchC benchmarks, successfully verifying loop unrolling, tiling, and fusion transformations. HEC processes over 100,000 lines of MLIR code in 40 minutes with predictable runtime scaling. Importantly, HEC identified two critical compilation errors in mlir-opt: loop boundary check errors causing unintended executions during unrolling, and memory read-after-write violations in loop fusion that alter program semantics. These findings demonstrate HEC practical value in detecting real-world compiler bugs and highlight the importance of formal verification in optimization pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by USENIX ATC 2025</p></details> |

Recent training procedures use execution feedback as a reward signal, typically focusing on the functional correctness of the code, using unit test pass rate as a reward signal. However, this reward signal fails to capture notions of maintainability, quality and safety of the code produced. We address this under-explored area and develop a comprehensive library to quantify various aspects of code quality, and use it as a reward in GRPO. We find GRPO increases code quality according to this measure, which is confirmed by expert, blinded human annotators.</p></details> |  |

The measurement on $\rho_x$ that is used to recover, say, $x_1$ may destroy all the information about the other bits; this is in fact what happens in the well-known QRAC that encodes $n=2$ bits into $m=1$ qubits. Does this generalize to large $n$, i.e., could there exist QRACs that are so "obfuscated" that one cannot get much more than one bit out of them? Here we show that this is not the case: for every QRAC there exists a measurement that (with high probability) recovers the full $n$-bit string $x$ up to small Hamming distance, even for the worst-case $x$.</p></details> | 14 pages LaTeX |
| **[Pearl: Automatic Code Optimization Using Deep Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01880v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compilers are crucial in optimizing programs and accelerating their execution. However, optimizing programs automatically using compilers is not trivial. Recent work has attempted to use reinforcement learning (RL) to solve this problem. It has limitations though. Current methods either do not support the optimization of general loop nests or can only be used to optimize loop nests seen during training. In this paper, we propose Pearl, a novel framework that uses deep reinforcement learning to automate compiler code optimization. It uses an RL agent to select the sequence of code optimizations a compiler should apply to make the input code run faster. This agent can optimize general loop nests and can generalize to programs unseen during training. To enable the optimization of general loop nests, we propose a novel representation of the action space that allows the RL agent to select on which part of the loop nest a given code optimization should be applied. Training RL agents for loop nest optimization is slow and data-intensive. We accelerate this process by caching results and pre-training the agent. Integrated with the Tiramisu compiler, our approach streamlines optimization and outperforms existing methods. To the best of our knowledge, Pearl is the first RL-based system to support general programs composed of loop nests manipulating tensors while still being able to generalize to programs unseen during training. It is also the first to support the class of polyhedral optimizations, a class of advanced loop nest optimizations. We evaluate Pearl on a set of benchmarks, and demonstrate competitive performance improvements over state-of-the-art compilers. Notably, Pearl achieves a geometric mean speedup of 2.02x compared to Tiramisu and 3.36x compared to Pluto.</p></details> |  |
| **[Black-Box Crypto is Useless for Pseudorandom Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01854v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A pseudorandom code is a keyed error-correction scheme with the property that any polynomial number of encodings appear random to any computationally bounded adversary. We show that the pseudorandomness of any code tolerating a constant rate of random errors cannot be based on black-box reductions to almost any generic cryptographic primitive: for instance, anything that can be built from random oracles, generic multilinear groups, and virtual black-box obfuscation. Our result is optimal, as Ghentiyala and Guruswami (2024) observed that pseudorandom codes tolerating any sub-constant rate of random errors exist using a black-box reduction from one-way functions. The key technical ingredient in our proof is the hypercontractivity theorem for Boolean functions, which we use to prove our impossibility in the random oracle model. It turns out that this easily extends to an impossibility in the presence of ``crypto oracles,'' a notion recently introduced -- and shown to be capable of implementing all the primitives mentioned above -- by Lin, Mook, and Wichs (EUROCRYPT 2025).</p></details> |  |
| **[Code-Switching and Syntax: A Large-Scale Experiment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01846v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The theoretical code-switching (CS) literature provides numerous pointwise investigations that aim to explain patterns in CS, i.e. why bilinguals switch language in certain positions in a sentence more often than in others. A resulting consensus is that CS can be explained by the syntax of the contributing languages. There is however no large-scale, multi-language, cross-phenomena experiment that tests this claim. When designing such an experiment, we need to make sure that the system that is predicting where bilinguals tend to switch has access only to syntactic information. We provide such an experiment here. Results show that syntax alone is sufficient for an automatic system to distinguish between sentences in minimal pairs of CS, to the same degree as bilingual humans. Furthermore, the learnt syntactic patterns generalise well to unseen language pairs.</p></details> | Findings of ACL 2025 |
| **[Minimal Pair-Based Evaluation of Code-Switching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01840v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There is a lack of an evaluation methodology that estimates the extent to which large language models (LLMs) use code-switching (CS) in the same way as bilinguals. Existing methods do not have wide language coverage, fail to account for the diverse range of CS phenomena, or do not scale. We propose an intervention based on minimal pairs of CS. Each minimal pair contains one naturally occurring CS sentence and one minimally manipulated variant. We collect up to 1,000 such pairs each for 11 language pairs. Our human experiments show that, for every language pair, bilinguals consistently prefer the naturally occurring CS sentence. Meanwhile our experiments with current LLMs show that the larger the model, the more consistently it assigns higher probability to the naturally occurring CS sentence than to the variant. In accordance with theoretical claims, the largest probability differences arise in those pairs where the manipulated material consisted of closed-class words.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

A Systematic Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01825v1)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code LLMs are increasingly employed in software development. However, studies have shown that they are vulnerable to backdoor attacks: when a trigger (a specific input pattern) appears in the input, the backdoor will be activated and cause the model to generate malicious outputs. Researchers have designed various triggers and demonstrated the feasibility of implanting backdoors by poisoning a fraction of the training data. Some basic conclusions have been made, such as backdoors becoming easier to implant when more training data are modified. However, existing research has not explored other factors influencing backdoor attacks on Code LLMs, such as training batch size, epoch number, and the broader design space for triggers, e.g., trigger length. To bridge this gap, we use code summarization as an example to perform an empirical study that systematically investigates the factors affecting backdoor effectiveness and understands the extent of the threat posed. Three categories of factors are considered: data, model, and inference, revealing previously overlooked findings. We find that the prevailing consensus -- that attacks are ineffective at extremely low poisoning rates -- is incorrect. The absolute number of poisoned samples matters as well. Specifically, poisoning just 20 out of 454K samples (0.004\% poisoning rate -- far below the minimum setting of 0.1\% in prior studies) successfully implants backdoors! Moreover, the common defense is incapable of removing even a single poisoned sample from it. Additionally, small batch sizes increase the risk of backdoor attacks. We also uncover other critical factors such as trigger types, trigger length, and the rarity of tokens in the triggers, leading to valuable insights for assessing Code LLMs' vulnerability to backdoor attacks. Our study highlights the urgent need for defense mechanisms against extremely low poisoning rate settings.</p></details> |  |

This paper investigates the role of grammar books in translating extremely low-resource languages by decomposing it into two key steps: grammar rule retrieval and application. To facilitate the study, we introduce ZhuangRules, a modularized dataset of grammar rules and their corresponding test sentences. Our analysis reveals that rule retrieval constitutes a primary bottleneck in grammar-based translation. Moreover, although LLMs can apply simple rules for translation when explicitly provided, they encounter difficulties in handling more complex rules. To address these challenges, we propose representing grammar rules as code functions, considering their similarities in structure and the benefit of code in facilitating LLM reasoning. Our experiments show that using code rules significantly boosts both rule retrieval and application, ultimately resulting in a 13.1% BLEU improvement in translation.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |

While most prior work on DHT has focused on informationtheoretic analyses, deriving bounds on Type-II error exponents via achievability schemes based on quantization and quantizebinning, the practical implementation of DHT coding schemes has remained largely unexplored. Moreover, existing practical coding solutions for quantization and quantize-binning approaches were developed for source reconstruction tasks considering very long code length, and they are not directly applicable to DHT. In this context, this paper introduces efficient shortlength implementations of quantization and quantize-binning schemes for DHT, constructed from short binary linear block codes. Numerical results show the efficiency of the proposed coding schemes compared to uncoded cases and to existing schemes initially developed for data reconstruction. In addition to practical code design, the paper derives exact analytical expressions for the Type-I and Type-II error probabilities associated with each proposed scheme. The provided analytical expressions are shown to predict accurately the practical performance measured from Monte-Carlo simulations of the proposed schemes. These theoretical results are novel and offer a useful framework for optimizing and comparing practical DHT schemes across a wide range of source and code parameters.</p></details> |  |

However, achieving high-quality code often requires iterative interactions, which can be time-consuming and inefficient. This paper explores the application of structured prompt patterns to minimize the number of interactions required for satisfactory AI-assisted code generation. Using the DevGPT dataset, we analyzed seven distinct prompt patterns to evaluate their effectiveness in reducing back-and-forth communication between developers and AI. Our findings highlight patterns such as ''Context and Instruction'' and ''Recipe'' as particularly effective in achieving high-quality outputs with minimal iterations. The study emphasizes the potential for prompt engineering to streamline developer-AI collaboration, providing practical insights into crafting prompts that balance precision, efficiency, and clarity.</p></details> |  |

Open-source models such as CodeBERT and UniXcoder exhibit limitations in scalability and efficiency, while high-performing proprietary systems impose substantial computational costs. We introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to construct task-specific adapters for code retrieval. Our approach reduces the number of trainable parameters to less than two percent of the base model, enabling rapid fine-tuning on extensive code corpora (2 million samples in 25 minutes on two H100 GPUs). Experiments demonstrate an increase of up to 9.1% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) for Code2Code search, and up to 86.69% for Text2Code search tasks across multiple programming languages. Distinction in task-wise and language-wise adaptation helps explore the sensitivity of code retrieval for syntactical and linguistic variations. To foster research in this area, we make our code and pre-trained models publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Deep Learning for Code (DL4C) Workshop at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

However, existing security analysis tools struggle with poor generalization, high false positive rates, and coarse detection granularity. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been considered promising candidates for addressing those challenges. In this study, we conducted an empirical study to explore the potential of LLMs in detecting security defects during code review. Specifically, we evaluated the performance of six LLMs under five different prompts and compared them with state-of-the-art static analysis tools. We also performed linguistic and regression analyses for the best-performing LLM to identify quality problems in its responses and factors influencing its performance. Our findings showthat: (1) existing pre-trained LLMs have limited capability in security code review but significantly outperformthe state-of-the-art static analysis tools. (2) GPT-4 performs best among all LLMs when provided with a CWE list for reference. (3) GPT-4 frequently generates verbose or non-compliant responses with the task requirements given in the prompts. (4) GPT-4 is more adept at identifying security defects in code files with fewer tokens, containing functional logic, or written by developers with less involvement in the project.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 images, 8 tables, Manuscript submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |

We aim at designing a general solution to optimize the latent manifolds to improve the performance on classification, segmentation, completion and/or reconstruction through probabilistic models. This paper proposes a variational inference model which leads to a clustered embedding. We introduce additional variables in the latent space, called \textbf{nebula anchors}, that guide the latent variables to form clusters during training. To prevent the anchors from clustering among themselves, we employ the variational constraint that enforces the latent features within an anchor to form a Gaussian distribution, resulting in a generative model we refer as Nebula Variational Coding (NVC). Since each latent feature can be labeled with the closest anchor, we also propose to apply metric learning in a self-supervised way to make the separation between clusters more explicit. As a consequence, the latent variables of our variational coder form clusters which adapt to the generated semantic of the training data, \textit{e.g.} the categorical labels of each sample. We demonstrate experimentally that it can be used within different architectures designed to solve different problems including text sequence, images, 3D point clouds and volumetric data, validating the advantage of our proposed method.</p></details> |  |

To promote further research on flowchart-based code generation, this work presents Flow2Code, a novel benchmark for flowchart-based code generation evaluation. The evaluation dataset spans 15 programming languages and includes 5,622 code segments paired with 16,866 flowcharts of three types: code, UML, and pseudocode. Extensive experiments with 13 multimodal LLMs reveal that current LLMs can not generate code based on flowcharts perfectly.

Recently, machine learning (ML) has gained traction for generating code optimized for specific hardware targets. However, ML approaches-particularly black-box neural networks-offer no guarantees on the correctness or legality of the transformations they produce. To address this gap, we introduce Tadashi, an end-to-end system that leverages the polyhedral model to support researchers in curating datasets critical for ML-based code generation. Tadashi provides an end-to-end system capable of applying, verifying, and evaluating candidate transformations on polyhedral schedules with both reliability and practicality. We formally prove that Tadashi guarantees the legality of generated transformations, demonstrate its low runtime overhead, and showcase its broad applicability.

However, current approaches primarily focus on enhancing average performance metrics, such as overall image reconstruction quality or task accuracy, which may not fully align with users' actual experience -- often driven by the quality of specific regions of interest (ROI). Motivated by this, we propose ROI-guided joint source-channel coding (ROI-JSCC), a novel deepJSCC framework that prioritizes high-quality transmission of ROI. The ROI-JSCC consists of four key components: (1) ROI embedding and feature map extraction, (2) ROI-guided split processing, (3) ROI-based loss function design, and (4) ROI-adaptive bandwidth allocation. Together, these components enable ROI-JSCC to selectively improve the reconstruction quality of varying ROI while preserving overall image quality without increasing computational burden.

This allows us to describe DNA code over this ring by characterizing $\theta$-skew cyclic reversible DNA codes and $\theta$-skew cyclic reversible complement DNA codes. We also explore the Gray images of $\theta$-skew cyclic codes.</p></details> |  |

These templates are crucial for generating actionable insights in various downstream tasks. However, existing parsers often fail to capture fine-grained template details, leading to suboptimal accuracy and reduced utility in downstream tasks requiring precise pattern identification. We propose a character-level log parser utilizing a novel neural architecture that aggregates character embeddings. Our approach estimates a sequence of binary-coded decimals to achieve highly granular log templates extraction. Our low-resource character-level parser, tested on revised Loghub-2k and a manually annotated industrial dataset, matches LLM-based parsers in accuracy while outperforming semantic parsers in efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print of our accepted paper at IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2025). 4 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[How Programming Concepts and Neurons Are Shared in Code Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01074v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several studies have explored the mechanisms of large language models (LLMs) in coding tasks, but most have focused on programming languages (PLs) in a monolingual setting. In this paper, we investigate the relationship between multiple PLs and English in the concept space of LLMs. We perform a few-shot translation task on 21 PL pairs using two Llama-based models. By decoding the embeddings of intermediate layers during this task, we observe that the concept space is closer to English (including PL keywords) and assigns high probabilities to English tokens in the second half of the intermediate layers. We analyze neuron activations for 11 PLs and English, finding that while language-specific neurons are primarily concentrated in the bottom layers, those exclusive to each PL tend to appear in the top layers. For PLs that are highly aligned with multiple other PLs, identifying language-specific neurons is not feasible. These PLs also tend to have a larger keyword set than other PLs and are closer to the model's concept space regardless of the input/output PL in the translation task. Our findings provide insights into how LLMs internally represent PLs, revealing structural patterns in the model's concept space. Code is available at https://github.com/cisnlp/code-specific-neurons.</p></details> | ACL Findings 2025 |

We then apply this framework to information set decoding, study success probabilities and give tools to choose variables. Finally, we use this to attack two cryptosystems based on convolutional codes. In the first, our code recovered about 74% of errors in less than 10 hours each, and in the second case, we give experimental evidence that 80% of the errors can be recovered in times corresponding to about 70 bits of operational security, with some instances being significantly lower.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Generic Construction on Self-orthogonal Algebraic Geometric Codes and Its Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00994v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the realm of algebraic geometric (AG) codes, characterizing dual codes has long been a challenging task. In this paper we introduces a generalized criterion to characterize self-orthogonality of AG codes based on residues, drawing upon the rich algebraic structures of finite fields and the geometric properties of algebraic curves. We also present a generic construction of self-orthogonal AG codes from self-dual MDS codes. Using these approaches, we construct several families of self-dual and almost self-dual AG codes. These codes combine two merits: good performance as AG code whose parameters are close to the Singleton bound together with Euclidean (or Hermtian) self-dual/self-orthogonal property. Furthermore, some AG codes with Hermitian self-orthogonality can be applied to construct quantum codes with notably good parameters.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce CODEMENV: Code Migration Across Environment, a new benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs' abilities in code migration scenarios. CODEMENV consists of 922 examples spanning 19 Python and Java packages, and covers three core tasks: (1) identifying functions incompatible with specific versions, (2) detecting changes in function definitions, and (3) adapting code to target environments. Experimental evaluation with seven LLMs on CODEMENV yields an average pass@1 rate of 26.50%, with GPT-4O achieving the highest score at 43.84%. Key findings include: (i) LLMs tend to be more proficient with newer function versions, which aids in migrating legacy code, and (ii) LLMs sometimes exhibit logical inconsistencies by identifying function changes irrelevant to the intended migration environment. The datasets are available at https://github.com/xdshen-ai/Benchmark-of-Code-Migration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[EvoGit: Decentralized Code Evolution via Git-Based Multi-Agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02049v1)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce EvoGit, a decentralized multi-agent framework for collaborative software development driven by autonomous code evolution. EvoGit deploys a population of independent coding agents, each proposing edits to a shared codebase without centralized coordination, explicit message passing, or shared memory. Instead, all coordination emerges through a Git-based phylogenetic graph that tracks the full version lineage and enables agents to asynchronously read from and write to the evolving code repository. This graph-based structure supports fine-grained branching, implicit concurrency, and scalable agent interaction while preserving a consistent historical record. Human involvement is minimal but strategic: users define high-level goals, periodically review the graph, and provide lightweight feedback to promote promising directions or prune unproductive ones. Experiments demonstrate EvoGit's ability to autonomously produce functional and modular software artifacts across two real-world tasks: (1) building a web application from scratch using modern frameworks, and (2) constructing a meta-level system that evolves its own language-model-guided solver for the bin-packing optimization problem. Our results underscore EvoGit's potential to establish a new paradigm for decentralized, automated, and continual software development. EvoGit is open-sourced at https://github.com/BillHuang2001/evogit.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeSense: a Real-World Benchmark and Dataset for Code Semantic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00750v1)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and reasoning about code semantics is essential for enhancing code LLMs' abilities to solve real-world software engineering (SE) tasks. Although several code reasoning benchmarks exist, most rely on synthetic datasets or educational coding problems and focus on coarse-grained reasoning tasks such as input/output prediction, limiting their effectiveness in evaluating LLMs in practical SE contexts. To bridge this gap, we propose CodeSense, the first benchmark that makes available a spectrum of fine-grained code reasoning tasks concerned with the software engineering of real-world code. We collected Python, C and Java software projects from real-world repositories. We executed tests from these repositories, collected their execution traces, and constructed a ground truth dataset for fine-grained semantic reasoning tasks. We then performed comprehensive evaluations on state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results show a clear performance gap for the models to handle fine-grained reasoning tasks. Although prompting techniques such as chain-of-thought and in-context learning helped, the lack of code semantics in LLMs fundamentally limit models' capabilities of code reasoning. Besides dataset, benchmark and evaluation, our work produced an execution tracing framework and tool set that make it easy to collect ground truth for fine-grained SE reasoning tasks, offering a strong basis for future benchmark construction and model post training. Our code and data are located at https://codesense-bench.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving the Context Length and Efficiency of Code Retrieval for Tracing Security Vulnerability Fixes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22935v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An upstream task for software bill-of-materials (SBOMs) is the accurate localization of the patch that fixes a vulnerability. Nevertheless, existing work reveals a significant gap in the CVEs whose patches exist but are not traceable. Existing works have proposed several approaches to trace/retrieve the patching commit for fixing a CVE. However, they suffer from two major challenges: (1) They cannot effectively handle long diff code of a commit; (2) We are not aware of existing work that scales to the full repository with satisfactory accuracy. Upon identifying this gap, we propose SITPatchTracer, a scalable and effective retrieval system for tracing known vulnerability patches. To handle the context length challenge, SITPatchTracer proposes a novel hierarchical embedding technique which efficiently extends the context coverage to 6x that of existing work while covering all files in the commit. To handle the scalability challenge, SITPatchTracer utilizes a three-phase framework, balancing the effectiveness/efficiency in each phase. The evaluation of SITPatchTracer demonstrates it outperforms existing patch tracing methods (PatchFinder, PatchScout, VFCFinder) by a large margin. Furthermore, SITPatchTracer outperforms VoyageAI, the SOTA commercial code embedding LLM (\$1.8 per 10K commits) on the MRR and Recall@10 by 18\% and 28\% on our two datasets. Using SITPatchTracer, we have successfully traced and merged the patch links for 35 new CVEs in the GitHub Advisory database Our ablation study reveals that hierarchical embedding is a practically effective way of handling long context for patch retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[NoCodeGPT: A No-Code Interface for Building Web Apps with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14843v3)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we first report an exploratory study where three participants were instructed to use ChatGPT to implement a simple Web-based application. A key finding of this study revealed that ChatGPT does not offer a user-friendly interface for building applications, even small web systems. For example, one participant with limited experience in software development was unable to complete any of the proposed user stories. Then, and as the primary contribution of this work, we decided to design, implement, and evaluate a tool that offers a customized interface for language models like GPT, specifically targeting the implementation of small web applications without writing code. This tool, called NoCodeGPT, instruments the prompts sent to the language model with useful contextual information (e.g., the files that need to be modified when the user identifies and requests a bug fix). It also saves the files generated by the language model in the correct directories. Additionally, a simple version control feature is offered, allowing users to quickly revert to a previous version of the code when the model enters a hallucination process, generating worthless results. To evaluate our tool, we invited 14 students with limited Web development experience to implement two small web applications using only prompts and NoCodeGPT. Overall, the results of this evaluation were quite satisfactory and significantly better than those of the initial study (the one using the standard ChatGPT interface). More than half of the participants (9 out of 14) successfully completed the proposed applications, while the others completed at least half of the proposed user stories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Software: Practice and Experience.

| **[Utilizing Precise and Complete Code Context to Guide LLM in Automatic False Positive Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03079v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are critical to software quality, identifying potential code issues early in development. However, they often produce false positive warnings that require manual review, slowing down development. Thus, automating false positive mitigation (FPM) is essential. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong abilities in natural language and code understanding, offers promising avenues for FPM. Yet current LLM-based FPM method faces two major limitations: 1. The warning-related code snippets extracted are overly broad and cluttered with irrelevant control/data flows, reducing precision; 2. Critical code contexts are missing, leading to incomplete representations that can mislead LLMs and cause inaccurate assessments. To overcome these limitations, we propose LLM4FPM , a lightweight and efficient false positive mitigation framework. It features eCPG-Slicer, which builds an extended code property graph (eCPG) to extract precise line-level code contexts for warnings. Furthermore, the integrated FARF algorithm builds a file reference graph to identify all files that are relevant to warnings in linear time. This enables eCPG-Slicer to obtain rich contextual information without resorting to expensive whole-program analysis. LLM4FPM outperforms the existing method on the Juliet dataset (F1 > 99% across various Common Weakness Enumerations) and improves label accuracy on the D2A dataset to 86%. By leveraging a lightweight open-source LLM, LLM4FPM can significantly save inspection costs up to \$2758 per run (\$0.384 per warning) on Juliet with an average inspection time of 4.7s per warning. Moreover, real-world tests on popular C/C++ projects demonstrate its practicality.</p></details> | 13 pages |

Previous SVG generation methods have focused on curve-based vectorization, lacking semantic understanding, often producing artifacts, and struggling with SVG primitives beyond path curves. To address these issues, we introduce StarVector, a multimodal large language model for SVG generation. It performs image vectorization by understanding image semantics and using SVG primitives for compact, precise outputs. Unlike traditional methods, StarVector works directly in the SVG code space, leveraging visual understanding to apply accurate SVG primitives. To train StarVector, we create SVG-Stack, a diverse dataset of 2M samples that enables generalization across vectorization tasks and precise use of primitives like ellipses, polygons, and text. We address challenges in SVG evaluation, showing that pixel-based metrics like MSE fail to capture the unique qualities of vector graphics. We introduce SVG-Bench, a benchmark across 10 datasets, and 3 tasks: Image-to-SVG, Text-to-SVG generation, and diagram generation. Using this setup, StarVector achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing more compact and semantically rich SVGs.</p></details> |  |

However, existing benchmarks lack the ability to automatically evaluate from users' perspective, and also lack the explainability of the results of LLM agents' code generation capabilities. Thus, we introduce ProjectEval, a new benchmark for LLM agents project-level code generation's automated evaluation by simulating user interaction. ProjectEval is constructed by LLM with human reviewing. It has three different level inputs of natural languages or code skeletons. ProjectEval can evaluate the generated projects by user interaction simulation for execution, and by code similarity through existing objective indicators. Through ProjectEval, we find that systematic engineering project code, overall understanding of the project and comprehensive analysis capability are the keys for LLM agents to achieve practical projects. Our findings and benchmark provide valuable insights for developing more effective programming agents that can be deployed in future real-world production.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages (9 Appendix pages), 4 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[CodeReviewQA: The Code Review Comprehension Assessment for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16167v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation capabilities but struggle with real-world software engineering tasks, such as revising source code to address code reviews, hindering their practical use. Code review comments are often implicit, ambiguous, and colloquial, requiring models to grasp both code and human intent. This challenge calls for evaluating large language models' ability to bridge both technical and conversational contexts. While existing work has employed the automated code refinement (ACR) task to resolve these comments, current evaluation methods fall short, relying on text matching metrics that provide limited insight into model failures and remain susceptible to training data contamination. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel evaluation benchmark, $\textbf{CodeReviewQA}$ that enables us to conduct fine-grained assessment of model capabilities and mitigate data contamination risks. In CodeReviewQA, we decompose the generation task of code refinement into $\textbf{three essential reasoning steps}$: $\textit{change type recognition}$ (CTR), $\textit{change localisation}$ (CL), and $\textit{solution identification}$ (SI). Each step is reformulated as multiple-choice questions with varied difficulty levels, enabling precise assessment of model capabilities, while mitigating data contamination risks. Our comprehensive evaluation spans 72 recently released large language models on $\textbf{900 manually curated, high-quality examples}$ across nine programming languages. Our results show that CodeReviewQA is able to expose specific model weaknesses in code review comprehension, disentangled from their generative automated code refinement results.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is published in Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025)</p></details> |

We fully characterize the sufficient and necessary conditions for the incidence structures to form $1$-designs in finite abelian $p$-groups, generalizing existing results on vector spaces over finite fields. For finite abelian groups of exponent $pq$, we also propose sufficient and necessary conditions for the incidence structures to form a $1$-designs. Furthermore, some interesting observations of the general case when the group is cyclic or non-cyclic are presented and the relations between $(t-1)$-designs and $t$-designs from subset sums are established. As an application, we demonstrate the correspondence between $t$-designs from the minimum-weight codewords in elliptic curve codes and subset-sum designs in their groups of rational points. By such a correspondence, elliptic curve codes supporting designs can be simply derived from subset sums in finite abelian groups that supporting designs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teaching an Old LLM Secure Coding: Localized Preference Optimization on Distilled Preferences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00419v1)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM generated code often contains security issues. We address two key challenges in improving secure code generation. First, obtaining high quality training data covering a broad set of security issues is critical. To address this, we introduce a method for distilling a preference dataset of insecure and secure code pairs from frontier LLMs, along with a security reasoning that explains the issues and the fix. The key idea here is to make use of security knowledge sources to devise a systematic prompting strategy that ensures broad coverage. Second, aligning models to secure code requires focusing on localized regions of code. Direct preference optimization methods, like SimPO, are not designed to handle these localized differences and turn out to be ineffective. We address this with a new localized preference optimization algorithm that masks the security related tokens in both the winning (secure) and losing (insecure) responses. To prevent loss in code quality, we also add a regularizer. Evaluations show that both training on our dataset, DiSCo, and the new preference optimization algorithm, LPO, yield substantial reductions in code insecurity while also improving overall code quality.

In particular, Code Snippets (CSs) are approved to be an effective way of introducing programming language units to students. CSs are portions of source code of varying size and content. They can be used in a myriad of ways, one of which is to teach the code they contain as well as its function. To further explore the use of CSs, a pedagogical summer internship project was set up at the Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG). The scope of the considerations for the study derives from an educational standpoint. Within the evaluations made, the focus was primarily given to pieces of information which proved to provide evidence pertaining to the methodology involved in either teaching or developing teaching materials. By taking the results produced into account from a pedagogical perspective, it was found that several qualities of popular code snippet tutorials which benefit or hinder the learning process, including code length, interactivity, further support, and quality of explanation. These qualities are then combined and used to present a plan for the design of an effective learning resource which makes use of code snippets.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 2023 UK and Ireland Engineering Education Research Network Conference</p></details> |

However, although LLMs show promising cross-lingual alignment in Information Extraction (IE), a significant imbalance across languages persists, highlighting an underlying deficiency. To address this, we propose KnowCoder-X, a powerful code LLM with advanced cross-lingual and multilingual capabilities for universal IE. Firstly, it standardizes the representation of multilingual schemas using Python classes, ensuring a consistent ontology across different languages. Then, IE across languages is formulated as a unified code generation task. Secondly, we conduct IE cross-lingual alignment instruction tuning on the translated instance prediction task to enhance the model's cross-lingual transferability. During this phase, we also construct a high-quality and diverse bilingual IE parallel dataset with 257k samples, called ParallelNER, synthesized by our proposed robust three-stage pipeline, with manual annotation to ensure quality. Although without training in 29 unseen languages, KnowCoder-X surpasses ChatGPT by 30.17\% and SoTA by 20.03\%, thereby demonstrating superior cross-lingual IE capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations on 64 IE benchmarks in Chinese and English under various settings demonstrate that KnowCoder-X significantly enhances cross-lingual IE transfer through boosting the IE alignment.

The two main RL approaches, namely RL with Verifiable Feedback (RLVR) and RL with AI Feedback (RLAIF), offer trade-offs: RLVR provides reliable feedback for structured tasks like code generation, while RLAIF works for unstructured outputs but is subjective. We bridge this gap with CRScore++, an RL framework that leverages both LLM-based subjective feedback and verifiable signals for training. Extending CRScore, a code review evaluation metric integrating LLMs with verifiers like linters and code smell detectors, CRScore++ transforms these signals into training rewards. We show that CRScore++ improves a weaker student model through a combination of supervised fine-tuning and RL critique from a stronger teacher model, thus enabling generalization to novel programming languages.</p></details> |  |

As a result, ASR requires new methods to utilize the vast monolingual data and models that exist. This paper uses OpenAI's open source ASR model, Whisper, which has been pre-trained on 680K hours of audio to perform monolingual ASR tasks. In Part 1, this paper examines how exploiting Whisper's monolingual ability to individually tokenize training text, called "Switching Tokenizers Method", improves transcription accuracy. In Part 2, we combine the Switching Tokenizers Method from part 1 and train a GELU based adapter on the encoder. These two methods reduced Total Mixed Error Rate (MER) to 9.4% for the ASCEND dataset, 6% for SEAME devman and 9.7% for SEAME devsge, outperforming current SoTA methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Calibration of Large Language Models on Code Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19318v3)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A brief, fluent, and relevant summary can be helpful during program comprehension; however, such a summary does require significant human effort to produce. Often, good summaries are unavailable in software projects, which makes maintenance more difficult. There has been a considerable body of research into automated AI-based methods, using Large Language models (LLMs), to generate summaries of code; there also has been quite a bit of work on ways to measure the performance of such summarization methods, with special attention paid to how closely these AI-generated summaries resemble a summary a human might have produced. Measures such as BERTScore and BLEU have been suggested and evaluated with human-subject studies. However, LLM-generated summaries can be inaccurate, incomplete, etc.: generally, too dissimilar to one that a good developer might write. Given an LLM-generated code summary, how can a user rationally judge if a summary is sufficiently good and reliable? Given just some input source code, and an LLM-generated summary, existing approaches can help judge brevity, fluency and relevance of the summary; however, it's difficult to gauge whether an LLM-generated summary sufficiently resembles what a human might produce, without a "golden" human-produced summary to compare against. We study this resemblance question as calibration problem: given just the code & the summary from an LLM, can we compute a confidence measure, that provides a reliable indication of whether the summary sufficiently resembles what a human would have produced in this situation? We examine this question using several LLMs, for several languages, and in several different settings. Our investigation suggests approaches to provide reliable predictions of the likelihood that an LLM-generated summary would sufficiently resemble a summary a human might write for the same code.</p></details> |  |

However, existing LLMs treat code as plain text and mask random character spans. We propose and evaluate AST-FIM, a pretraining strategy that leverages Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to mask complete syntactic structures at scale, ensuring coherent training examples better aligned with universal code structures and common code editing patterns such as blocks, expressions, or functions. To evaluate real-world fill-in-the-middle (FIM) programming tasks, we introduce Real-FIM-Eval, a benchmark derived from 30,000+ GitHub commits across 12 languages. On infilling tasks, experiments on 1B and 8B parameter models show that AST-FIM is particularly beneficial for real-world code editing as it outperforms standard random-character FIM by up to 5 pts on standard FIM benchmarks.

Existing long-horizon suites (e.g. SWE-bench) rely on manually curated issues, so expanding or tuning difficulty demands expensive human effort and evaluations quickly saturate. However, many real-world tasks, such as software engineering or scientific research, require agents to rapidly comprehend and manipulate novel, complex structures dynamically; evaluating these capabilities requires the ability to construct large and varied sets of problems for agents to solve. We introduce Breakpoint, a benchmarking methodology that automatically generates code-repair tasks by adversarially corrupting functions within real-world software repositories. Breakpoint systematically controls task difficulty along two clear dimensions: local reasoning (characterized by code complexity metrics such as cyclomatic complexity) and system-level reasoning (characterized by call-graph centrality and the number of simultaneously corrupted interdependent functions). In experiments across more than 900 generated tasks we demonstrate that our methodology can scale to arbitrary difficulty, with state-of-the-art models' success rates ranging from 55% on the easiest tasks down to 0% on the hardest.</p></details> | 21 pages, 14 figures |

These behaviors can have severe consequences in critical domains, like software security. We propose Human-in-the-loop Decoding, a novel interaction technique that allows users to observe and directly influence LLM decisions during code generation, in order to align the model's output with their personal requirements. We implement this technique in HiLDe, a code completion assistant that highlights critical decisions made by the LLM and provides local alternatives for the user to explore. In a within-subjects study (N=18) on security-related tasks, we found that HiLDe led participants to generate significantly fewer vulnerabilities and better align code generation with their goals compared to a traditional code completion assistant.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |

Existing approaches face significant challenges, including reliance on hand-crafted prompts, difficulty in multi-step planning, and lack of precise error diagnosis and reflection mechanisms. We propose ToolCoder, a novel framework that reformulates tool learning as a code generation task. Inspired by software engineering principles, ToolCoder transforms natural language queries into structured Python function scaffold and systematically breaks down tasks with descriptive comments, enabling LLMs to leverage coding paradigms for complex reasoning and planning. It then generates and executes function implementations to obtain final responses. Additionally, ToolCoder stores successfully executed functions in a repository to promote code reuse, while leveraging error traceback mechanisms for systematic debugging, optimizing both execution efficiency and robustness. Experiments demonstrate that ToolCoder achieves superior performance in task completion accuracy and execution reliability compared to existing approaches, establishing the effectiveness of code-centric approaches in tool learning.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2025 |
| **[CoRet: Improved Retriever for Code Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24715v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce CoRet, a dense retrieval model designed for code-editing tasks that integrates code semantics, repository structure, and call graph dependencies. The model focuses on retrieving relevant portions of a code repository based on natural language queries such as requests to implement new features or fix bugs. These retrieved code chunks can then be presented to a user or to a second code-editing model or agent. To train CoRet, we propose a loss function explicitly designed for repository-level retrieval. On SWE-bench and Long Code Arena's bug localisation datasets, we show that our model substantially improves retrieval recall by at least 15 percentage points over existing models, and ablate the design choices to show their importance in achieving these results.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |
| **[Maximally recoverable codes with locality and availability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24573v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce maximally recoverable codes with locality and availability. We consider locally repairable codes (LRCs) where certain subsets of $ t $ symbols belong each to $ N $ local repair sets, which are pairwise disjoint after removing the $ t $ symbols, and which are of size $ r+\delta-1 $ and can correct $ \delta-1 $ erasures locally. Classical LRCs with $ N $ disjoint repair sets and LRCs with $ N $-availability are recovered when setting $ t = 1 $ and $ t=\delta-1=1 $, respectively. Allowing $ t > 1 $ enables our codes to reduce the storage overhead for the same locality and availability. In this setting, we define maximally recoverable LRCs (MR-LRCs) as those that can correct any globally correctable erasure pattern given the locality and availability constraints. We provide three explicit constructions, based on MSRD codes, each attaining the smallest finite-field sizes for some parameter regime. Finally, we extend the known lower bound on finite-field sizes from classical MR-LRCs to our setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Holes of Twisted Reed-Solomon Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11436v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deep holes of a linear code are the vectors that achieve the maximum error distance (covering radius) to the code. {Determining the covering radius and deep holes of linear codes is a fundamental problem in coding theory. In this paper, we investigate the problem of deep holes of twisted Reed-Solomon codes.} The covering radius and a standard class of deep holes of twisted Reed-Solomon codes ${\rm TRS}_k(\mathcal{A}, \theta)$ are obtained for a general evaluation set $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q$. Furthermore, we consider the problem of determining all deep holes of the full-length twisted Reed-Solomon codes ${\rm TRS}_k(\mathbb{F}_q, \theta)$. For even $q$, by utilizing the polynomial method and Gauss sums over finite fields, we prove that the standard deep holes are all the deep holes of ${\rm TRS}_k(\mathbb{F}_q, \theta)$ with $\frac{3q-4}{4} \leq k\leq q-4$. For odd $q$, we adopt a different method and employ the results on some equations over finite fields to show that there are also no other deep holes of ${\rm TRS}_k(\mathbb{F}_q, \theta)$ with $\frac{3q+3\sqrt{q}-7}{4} \leq k\leq q-4$. In addition, for the boundary cases of $k=q-3, q-2$ and $q-1$, we completely determine their deep holes using results on certain character sums.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Effective Code-Integrated Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24480v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate code-integrated reasoning, where models generate code when necessary and integrate feedback by executing it through a code interpreter. To acquire this capability, models must learn when and how to use external code tools effectively, which is supported by tool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) through interactive learning. Despite its benefits, tool-augmented RL can still suffer from potential instability in the learning dynamics. In light of this challenge, we present a systematic approach to improving the training effectiveness and stability of tool-augmented RL for code-integrated reasoning. Specifically, we develop enhanced training strategies that balance exploration and stability, progressively building tool-use capabilities while improving reasoning performance. Through extensive experiments on five mainstream mathematical reasoning benchmarks, our model demonstrates significant performance improvements over multiple competitive baselines. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the mechanism and effect of code-integrated reasoning, revealing several key insights, such as the extension of model's capability boundaries and the simultaneous improvement of reasoning efficiency through code integration.

| **[Image Editing As Programs with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04158v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation, they encounter significant challenges with instruction-driven image editing. Our research highlights a key challenge: these models particularly struggle with structurally inconsistent edits that involve substantial layout changes. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Image Editing As Programs (IEAP), a unified image editing framework built upon the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. At its core, IEAP approaches instructional editing through a reductionist lens, decomposing complex editing instructions into sequences of atomic operations. Each operation is implemented via a lightweight adapter sharing the same DiT backbone and is specialized for a specific type of edit. Programmed by a vision-language model (VLM)-based agent, these operations collaboratively support arbitrary and structurally inconsistent transformations. By modularizing and sequencing edits in this way, IEAP generalizes robustly across a wide range of editing tasks, from simple adjustments to substantial structural changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IEAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks across various editing scenarios. In these evaluations, our framework delivers superior accuracy and semantic fidelity, particularly for complex, multi-step instructions. Codes are available at https://github.com/YujiaHu1109/IEAP.</p></details> |  |
| **[CETBench: A Novel Dataset constructed via Transformations over Programs for Benchmarking LLMs for Code-Equivalence Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04019v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have been extensively used for the task of automated code generation. In this work, we examine the applicability of LLMs for the related but relatively unexplored task of code-equivalence checking, i.e., given two programs, whether they are functionally equivalent or not. This is an important problem since benchmarking code equivalence can play a critical role in evaluating LLM capabilities for tasks such as code re-writing and code translation. Towards this end, we present CETBench - Code Equivalence with Transformations Benchmark, constructed via a repository of programs, where two programs in the repository may be solving the same or different tasks. Each instance in our dataset is obtained by taking a pair of programs in the repository and applying a random series of pre-defined code transformations, resulting in (non-)equivalent pairs. Our analysis on this dataset reveals a surprising finding that very simple code transformations in the underlying pair of programs can result in a significant drop in performance of SOTA LLMs for the task of code-equivalence checking. To remedy this, we present a simple fine-tuning-based approach to boost LLM performance on the transformed pairs of programs. Our approach for dataset generation is generic, and can be used with repositories with varying program difficulty levels and allows for applying varying numbers as well as kinds of transformations. In our experiments, we perform ablations over the difficulty level of original programs, as well as the kind of transformations used in generating pairs for equivalence checking. Our analysis presents deep insights into the working of LLMs for the task of code-equivalence, and points to the fact that they may still be far from what could be termed as a semantic understanding of the underlying code.</p></details> |  |
| **[MacroSwarm: A Field-based Compositional Framework for Swarm Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10969v3)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Swarm behaviour engineering is an area of research that seeks to investigate methods and techniques for coordinating computation and action within groups of simple agents to achieve complex global goals like pattern formation, collective movement, clustering, and distributed sensing. Despite recent progress in the analysis and engineering of swarms (of drones, robots, vehicles), there is still a need for general design and implementation methods and tools that can be used to define complex swarm behaviour in a principled way. To contribute to this quest, this article proposes a new field-based coordination approach, called MacroSwarm, to design and program swarm behaviour in terms of reusable and fully composable functional blocks embedding collective computation and coordination. Based on the macroprogramming paradigm of aggregate computing, MacroSwarm builds on the idea of expressing each swarm behaviour block as a pure function, mapping sensing fields into actuation goal fields, e.g., including movement vectors. In order to demonstrate the expressiveness, compositionality, and practicality of MacroSwarm as a framework for swarm programming, we perform a variety of simulations covering common patterns of flocking, pattern formation, and collective decision-making. The implications of the inherent self-stabilisation properties of field-based computations in MacroSwarm are discussed, which formally guarantee some resilience properties and guided the design of the library.</p></details> |  |

The approach builds on a conditional logic with typicality, and on the combination of a conditional knowledge base with an ASP program, and allows for conditional reasoning over the answer sets of the program. The formalism relies on a multi-preferential semantics (and on the KLM preferential semantics, as a special case) to provide an interpretation of conditionals.</p></details> | 19 pages |
| **[Pseudorandom bits for non-commutative programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01832v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We obtain new explicit pseudorandom generators for several computational models involving groups. Our main results are as follows: 1. We consider read-once group-products over a finite group $G$, i.e., tests of the form $\prod_{i=1}^n g_i^{x_i}$ where $g_i\in G$, a special case of read-once permutation branching programs. We give generators with optimal seed length $c_G \log(n/\varepsilon)$ over any $p$-group. The proof uses the small-bias plus noise paradigm, but derandomizes the noise to avoid the recursion in previous work. Our generator works when the bits are read in any order. Previously for any non-commutative group the best seed length was $\ge\log n\log(1/\varepsilon)$, even for a fixed order. 2. We give a reduction that "lifts" suitable generators for group products over $G$ to a generator that fools width-$w$ block products, i.e., tests of the form $\prod g_i^{f_i}$ where the $f_i$ are arbitrary functions on disjoint blocks of $w$ bits. Block products generalize several previously studied classes. The reduction applies to groups that are mixing in a representation-theoretic sense that we identify. 3. Combining (2) with (1) and other works we obtain new generators for block products over the quaternions or over any commutative group, with nearly optimal seed length. In particular, we obtain generators for read-once polynomials modulo any fixed $m$ with nearly optimal seed length. Previously this was known only for $m=2$. 4. We give a new generator for products over "mixing groups." The construction departs from previous work and uses representation theory. For constant error, we obtain optimal seed length, improving on previous work (which applied to any group). This paper identifies a challenge in the area that is reminiscent of a roadblock in circuit complexity -- handling composite moduli -- and points to several classes of groups to be attacked next.</p></details> | Minor fixes |
| **[Boosting Open-Source LLMs for Program Repair via Reasoning Transfer and LLM-Guided Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03921v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several closed-source LLMs have consistently outperformed open-source alternatives in program repair tasks, primarily due to their superior reasoning capabilities and extensive pre-training. This paper introduces Repairity, a novel three-stage methodology that significantly narrows this performance gap through reasoning extraction and reinforcement learning. Our approach: (1) systematically filters high-quality reasoning traces from closed-source models using correctness verification, (2) transfers this reasoning knowledge to open-source models via supervised fine-tuning, and (3) develops reinforcement learning with LLM-based feedback to further optimize performance. Empirical evaluation across multiple program repair benchmarks demonstrates that Repairity improves the performance of Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct, a base open source LLM, by 8.68\% on average, reducing the capability gap with Claude-Sonnet3.7, a state-of-the-art closed-source model, from 10.05% to 1.35%. Ablation studies confirm that both reasoning extraction and LLM-guided reinforcement learning contribute significantly to these improvements. Our methodology generalizes effectively to additional code-related tasks, enabling organizations to leverage high-quality program repair capabilities while maintaining the customizability, transparency, and deployment flexibility inherent to open-source models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Fair And Effective Points-Based Rewards Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03911v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Points-based rewards programs are a prevalent way to incentivize customer loyalty; in these programs, customers who make repeated purchases from a seller accumulate points, working toward eventual redemption of a free reward. These programs have recently come under scrutiny due to accusations of unfair practices in their implementation. Motivated by these concerns, we study the problem of fairly designing points-based rewards programs, with a focus on two obstacles that put fairness at odds with their effectiveness. First, due to customer heterogeneity, the seller should set different redemption thresholds for different customers to generate high revenue. Second, the relationship between customer behavior and the number of accumulated points is typically unknown; this requires experimentation which may unfairly devalue customers' previously earned points. We first show that an individually fair rewards program that uses the same redemption threshold for all customers suffers a loss in revenue of at most a factor of $1+\ln 2$, compared to the optimal personalized strategy that differentiates between customers. We then tackle the problem of designing temporally fair learning algorithms in the presence of demand uncertainty. Toward this goal, we design a learning algorithm that limits the risk of point devaluation due to experimentation by only changing the redemption threshold $O(\log T)$ times, over a horizon of length $T$. This algorithm achieves the optimal (up to polylogarithmic factors) $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in expectation. We then modify this algorithm to only ever decrease redemption thresholds, leading to improved fairness at a cost of only a constant factor in regret. Extensive numerical experiments show the limited value of personalization in average-case settings, in addition to demonstrating the strong practical performance of our proposed learning algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solsmith: Solidity Random Program Generator for Compiler Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03909v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts are computer programs that run on blockchain platforms, with Solidity being the most widely used language for their development. As blockchain technology advances, smart contracts have become increasingly important across various fields. In order for smart contracts to operate correctly, the correctness of the compiler is particularly crucial. Although some research efforts have been devoted to testing Solidity compilers, they primarily focus on testing methods and do not address the core issue of generating test programs. To fill this gap, this paper designs and implements Solsmith, a test program generator specifically aimed at uncovering defects in Solidity compilers. It tests the compiler correctness by generating valid and diverse Solidity programs. We have designed a series of unique program generation strategies tailored to Solidity, including enabling optimizations more frequently, avoiding undefined behaviour, and mitigating behavioural differences caused by intermediate representations. To validate the effectiveness of Solsmith, we assess the effectiveness of the test programs generated by Solsmith using the approach of differential testing. The preliminary results show that Solsmith can generate the expected test programs and uncover four confirmed defects in Solidity compilers, demonstrating the effectiveness and potential of Solsmith.</p></details> | 11 pages, 12 figures |

Unlike 2D images, which are widely accessible, acquiring 3D assets requires specialized expertise or professional 3D scanning equipment, making it difficult to scale and raising copyright concerns. To address these challenges, we propose learning 3D representations from procedural 3D programs that automatically generate 3D shapes using simple primitives and augmentations. Remarkably, despite lacking semantic content, the 3D representations learned from the procedurally generated 3D shapes perform on par with state-of-the-art representations learned from semantically recognizable 3D models (e.g., airplanes) across various downstream 3D tasks, including shape classification, part segmentation, and masked point cloud completion. We provide a detailed analysis on factors that make a good 3D procedural program. Extensive experiments further suggest that current self-supervised learning methods on point clouds do not rely on the semantics of 3D shapes, shedding light on the nature of 3D representations learned.</p></details> | <details><summary>SynDa...</summary><p>SynData4CV @ CVPR2025 | Project Page: https://point-mae-zero.cs.virginia.edu/</p></details> |
| **[Design of a visual environment for programming by direct data manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03720v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of applications on computers, smartphones, and tablets has been considerably simplified thanks to interactive and dynamic graphical interfaces coupled with the mouse and touch screens. It is no longer necessary to be a computer specialist to use them. Paradoxically, the development of computer programs generally requires writing lines of code in a programming language whose syntax is particularly strict. This process poses many difficulties for programmers. We propose an original tool in which arbitrary programs (Turing-complete) can be developed in a completely visual manner by direct manipulation of the data, without writing a line of code. The user can thus develop an algorithm by directly visualizing the result of actions taken on the data. A method for constructing iterations is associated with the tool. It proposes to create each part, including the loop body, in a non-linear manner under visual control of the state of the data. In addition, the tool supports the production of lines of code in several languages including Python, C, Java, that correspond to the actions performed. In this article, we present the tool, the design choices, the problems to be solved, and the limits and the contributions of the direct-data-manipulation approach.</p></details> | in French language |

Multi-lingual RACG systems are valuable for migrating code-bases across programming languages (PLs), yet face risks from error (e.g. adversarial data corruption) propagation in cross-lingual transfer. We construct a dataset spanning 13 PLs with nearly 14k instances to explore utility and robustness of multi-lingual RACG systems. Our investigation reveals four key insights: (1) Effectiveness: multi-lingual RACG significantly enhances multi-lingual code LLMs generation; (2) Inequality: Java demonstrate superior cross-lingual utility over Python in RACG; (3) Robustness: Adversarial attacks degrade performance significantly in mono-lingual RACG but show mitigated impacts in cross-lingual scenarios; Counterintuitively, perturbed code may improve RACG in cross-lingual scenarios; (4) Specialization: Domain-specific code retrievers outperform significantly general text retrievers. These findings establish foundation for developing effective and secure multi-lingual code assistants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meaning-Typed Programming: Language Abstraction and Runtime for Model-Integrated Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08965v4)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software development is shifting from traditional logical programming to model-integrated applications that leverage generative AI and large language models (LLMs) during runtime. However, integrating LLMs remains complex, requiring developers to manually craft prompts and process outputs. Existing tools attempt to assist with prompt engineering, but often introduce additional complexity. This paper presents Meaning-Typed Programming (MTP) model, a novel paradigm that abstracts LLM integration through intuitive language-level constructs. By leveraging the inherent semantic richness of code, MTP automates prompt generation and response handling without additional developer effort. We introduce the by operator for seamless LLM invocation, MT-IR, a meaning-based intermediate representation for semantic extraction, and MT-Runtime, an automated system for managing LLM interactions. We implement MTP in Jac, a Python superset language and find that MTP significantly reduces coding complexity while maintaining accuracy and efficiency. Our evaluation across diverse benchmarks and user studies demonstrates that MTP outperforms existing frameworks such as DSPy and LMQL by reducing lines of code by factors of 2.3-7.5X and 1.3-10.7X respectively. For math problems from the GSM8k dataset, MTP achieves accuracy rates approaching 90%, while reducing token usage in 10 out of 13 benchmarks. This leads to cost savings up to 4.5X and runtime speedups as high as 4.75X. Additionally, MTP demonstrates resilience even when 50% of naming conventions are suboptimal, establishing it as a practical, efficient solution for streamlining model-integrated application development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empirical Evaluation of Generalizable Automated Program Repair with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03283v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) proposes bug fixes to aid developers in maintaining software. The state of the art in this domain focuses on using LLMs, leveraging their strong capabilities to comprehend specifications in natural language and to generate program code. Recent works have shown that LLMs can be used to generate repairs. However, despite the APR community's research achievements and several industry deployments in the last decade, APR still lacks the capabilities to generalize broadly. In this work, we present an intensive empirical evaluation of LLMs for generating patches. We evaluate a diverse set of 13 recent models, including open ones (e.g., Llama 3.3, Qwen 2.5 Coder, and DeepSeek R1 (dist.)) and closed ones (e.g., o3-mini, GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash). In particular, we explore language-agnostic repairs by utilizing benchmarks for Java (e.g., Defects4J), JavaScript (e.g., BugsJS), Python (e.g., BugsInPy), and PHP (e.g., BugsPHP). Besides the generalization between different languages and levels of patch complexity, we also investigate the effects of fault localization (FL) as a preprocessing step and compare the progress for open vs closed models. Our evaluation represents a snapshot of the current repair capabilities of the latest LLMs. Key results include: (1) Different LLMs tend to perform best for different languages, which makes it hard to develop cross-platform repair techniques with single LLMs. (2) The combinations of models add value with respect to uniquely fixed bugs, so a committee of expert models should be considered. (3) Under realistic assumptions of imperfect FL, we observe significant drops in accuracy from the usual practice of using perfect FL. Our findings and insights will help both researchers and practitioners develop reliable and generalizable APR techniques and evaluate them in realistic and fair environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[It's Not Easy Being Green: On the Energy Efficiency of Programming Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05460v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Does the choice of programming language affect energy consumption? Previous highly visible studies have established associations between certain programming languages and energy consumption. A causal misinterpretation of this work has led academics and industry leaders to use or support certain languages based on their claimed impact on energy consumption. This paper tackles this causal question directly. It first corrects and improves the measurement methodology used by prior work. It then develops a detailed causal model capturing the complex relationship between programming language choice and energy consumption. This model identifies and incorporates several critical but previously overlooked factors that affect energy usage. These factors, such as distinguishing programming languages from their implementations, the impact of the application implementations themselves, the number of active cores, and memory activity, can significantly skew energy consumption measurements if not accounted for. We show -- via empirical experiments, improved methodology, and careful examination of anomalies -- that when these factors are controlled for, notable discrepancies in prior work vanish. Our analysis suggests that the choice of programming language implementation has no significant impact on energy consumption beyond execution time.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16 on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Programming Techniques for Enhancing Cognitive Representation in Knowledge Tracing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02949v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Tracing (KT) involves monitoring the changes in a student's knowledge over time by analyzing their past responses, with the goal of predicting future performance. However, most existing methods primarily focus on feature enhancement, while overlooking the deficiencies in cognitive representation and the ability to express cognition-issues often caused by interference from non-cognitive factors such as slipping and guessing. This limitation hampers the ability to capture the continuity and coherence of the student's cognitive process. As a result, many methods may introduce more prediction bias and modeling costs due to their inability to maintain cognitive continuity and coherence. Based on the above discussion, we propose the Cognitive Representation Dynamic Programming based Knowledge Tracing (CRDP-KT) model. This model em ploys a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize cognitive representations based on the difficulty of the questions and the performance intervals between them. This approach ensures that the cognitive representation aligns with the student's cognitive patterns, maintaining overall continuity and coherence. As a result, it provides more accurate and systematic input features for subsequent model training, thereby minimizing distortion in the simulation of cognitive states. Additionally, the CRDP-KT model performs partitioned optimization of cognitive representations to enhance the reliability of the optimization process. Furthermore, it improves its ability to express the student's cognition through a weighted fusion of optimized record representations and re lationships learned from a bipartite graph. Finally, experiments conducted on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed CRDP-KT model.</p></details> |  |

Under a coerciveness assumption, we show that an $\varepsilon$-minimizer can be computed in a time that is polynomial in the input size and in $|\log\varepsilon|$. This is obtained by establishing bit-size estimates on approximate minimizers and by applying the ellipsoid method. We also derive polynomial iteration complexity bounds for the interior-point method applied to the same class of problems. We deduce that the spectral radius of a partially symmetric, weakly irreducible nonnegative tensor can be approximated within an $\varepsilon$-error in polynomial time. For strongly irreducible tensors, we show in addition that the logarithm of the positive eigenvector is polynomial time approximable. Our results also yield that the the maximum of a nonnegative homogeneous $d$-form in the $\ell_d$ unit ball can be approximated in polynomial time. In particular, the spectral radius of uniform weighted hypergraphs and some known upper bounds for the clique number of uniform hypergraphs are polynomial time computable. In contrast, we provide an example showing that the Phase I approach needs exponentially many bits to solve the feasibility problem in geometric programming.</p></details> | 36 pages |

Inspired by the Kuramoto model, we represent MPI processes as coupled oscillators with topology-aware interactions, custom coupling potentials, and stochastic noise. The resulting system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations opens a path to modeling key performance phenomena of parallel programs, including synchronization, delay propagation and decay, bottlenecks, and self-desynchronization. This paper introduces interaction potentials to describe memory- and compute-bound workloads and employs multiple quantitative metrics -- such as an order parameter, synchronization entropy, phase gradients, and phase differences -- to evaluate phase coherence and disruption. We also investigate the role of local noise and show that moderate noise can accelerate resynchronization in scalable applications. Our simulations align qualitatively with MPI trace data, showing the potential of physics-informed abstractions to predict performance patterns, which offers a new perspective for performance modeling and software-hardware co-design in parallel computing.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hierarchical Integer Linear Programming Approach for Optimizing Team Formation in Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02756v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teamwork is integral to higher education, fostering students' interpersonal skills, improving learning outcomes, and preparing them for professional collaboration later in their careers. While team formation has traditionally been managed by humans, either instructors or students, algorithmic approaches have recently emerged to optimize this process. However, existing algorithmic team formation methods often focus on expert teams, overlook agency in choosing one's teammates, and are limited to a single team formation setting. These limitations make them less suitable for education, where no student can be left out, student agency is crucial for motivation, and team formation needs vary across courses and programs. In this paper, we introduce the EDUCATIONAL TEAM FORMATION problem (EDU-TF), a partitioning optimization problem model tailored to the unique needs of education, integrating both teacher and student requirements. To solve EDU-TF, we propose a modular optimization approach, one of the first to allow the flexible adjustment of objectives according to educational needs, enhancing the method's applicability across various classroom settings rather than just research environments. Results from evaluating ten strategies derived from our model on real-world university datasets indicate that our approach outperforms heuristic teacher-assigned teams by better accommodating student preferences. Our study contributes a new modular approach to partition-based algorithmic team formation and provides valuable insights for future research on team formation in educational settings.</p></details> |  |

Current methods exhibit failures in generating physically plausible arrangements that respect the provided text description. We present SceneMotifCoder (SMC), an example-driven framework for generating 3D object arrangements through visual program learning. SMC leverages large language models (LLMs) and program synthesis to overcome these challenges by learning visual programs from example arrangements. These programs are generalized into compact, editable meta-programs. When combined with 3D object retrieval and geometry-aware optimization, they can be used to create object arrangements varying in arrangement structure and contained objects. Our experiments show that SMC generates high-quality arrangements using meta-programs learned from few examples. Evaluation results demonstrates that object arrangements generated by SMC better conform to user-specified text descriptions and are more physically plausible when compared with state-of-the-art text-to-3D generation and layout methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 3DV 2025 (Oral).

Existing prompt-based methods craft meticulous text guidelines and examples to facilitate SQL generation, but their accuracy is hindered by the large semantic gap between the texts and the low-resource SQL programs. In this work, we propose Pi-SQL, which incorporates the high-resource Python program as a pivot to bridge between the natural language query and SQL program. In particular, Pi-SQL first generates Python programs that provide fine-grained step-by-step guidelines in their code blocks or comments, and then produces an SQL program following the guidance of each Python program. The final SQL program matches the reference Python program's query results and, through selection from candidates generated by different strategies, achieves superior execution speed, with a reward-based valid efficiency score up to 4.55 higher than the best-performing baseline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Pi-SQL, which improves the execution accuracy of the best-performing baseline by up to 3.20.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional static benchmarks, SwingArena models the collaborative process of software iteration by pairing LLMs as submitters, who generate patches, and reviewers, who create test cases and verify the patches through continuous integration (CI) pipelines. To support these interactive evaluations, we introduce a retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) module that efficiently handles long-context challenges by providing syntactically and semantically relevant code snippets from large codebases, supporting multiple programming languages (C++, Python, Rust, and Go). This enables the framework to scale across diverse tasks and contexts while respecting token limitations. Our experiments, using over 400 high-quality real-world GitHub issues selected from a pool of 2,300 issues, show that models like GPT-4o excel at aggressive patch generation, whereas DeepSeek and Gemini prioritize correctness in CI validation. SwingArena presents a scalable and extensible methodology for evaluating LLMs in realistic, CI-driven software development settings.

A balanced signed graph is a signed graph with no cycles containing an odd number of negative edges. Laplacian of a balanced signed graph has eigenvectors that map via a simple linear transform to ones in a corresponding positive graph Laplacian, thus enabling reuse of spectral filtering tools designed for positive graphs. We propose an efficient method to learn a balanced signed graph Laplacian directly from data. Specifically, extending a previous linear programming (LP) based sparse inverse covariance estimation method called CLIME, we formulate a new LP problem for each Laplacian column $i$, where the linear constraints restrict weight signs of edges stemming from node $i$, so that nodes of same / different polarities are connected by positive / negative edges. Towards optimal model selection, we derive a suitable CLIME parameter $\rho$ based on a combination of the Hannan-Quinn information criterion and a minimum feasibility criterion. We solve the LP problem efficiently by tailoring a sparse LP method based on ADMM. We theoretically prove local solution convergence of our proposed iterative algorithm. Extensive experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our balanced graph learning method outperforms competing methods and enables reuse of spectral filters, wavelets, and graph convolutional nets (GCN) constructed for positive graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</p></details> |

A mixed-methods study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16764v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many application domains, domain-specific languages can allow domain experts to contribute to collaborative projects more correctly and efficiently. To do so, they must be able to understand program structure from reading existing source code. With high-quality data becoming an increasingly important resource, the creation of data pipelines is an important application domain for domain-specific languages. We execute a mixed-method study consisting of a controlled experiment and a follow-up descriptive survey among the participants to understand the effects of a domain-specific language on bottom-up program understanding and generate hypotheses for future research. During the experiment, participants need the same time to solve program structure comprehension tasks, but are significantly more correct when using the domain-specific language. In the descriptive survey, participants describe reasons related to the programming language itself, such as a better pipeline overview, more enforced code structure, and a closer alignment to the mental model of a data pipeline. In addition, human factors such as less required programming experience and the ability to reuse experience from other data engineering tools are discussed. Based on these results, domain-specific languages are a promising tool for creating data pipelines that can increase correct understanding of program structure and lower barriers to entry for domain experts. Open questions exist to make more informed implementation decisions for domain-specific languages for data pipelines in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Use o...</summary><p>Use of standard two-sided hypothesis tests and improved presentation</p></details> |

Recently, learning-to-optimize methods (L2O) for linear (LPs) or quadratic programs (QPs) using message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) have gained traction, promising lightweight, data-driven proxies for solving such optimization problems. For example, they replace the costly computation of strong branching scores in branch-and-bound solvers, requiring solving many such optimization problems. However, robust L2O MPNNs remain challenging in data-scarce settings, especially when addressing complex optimization problems such as QPs. This work introduces a principled approach to data augmentation tailored for QPs via MPNNs. Our method leverages theoretically justified data augmentation techniques to generate diverse yet optimality-preserving instances. Furthermore, we integrate these augmentations into a self-supervised learning framework based on contrastive learning, thereby pretraining MPNNs for enhanced performance on L2O tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves generalization in supervised scenarios and facilitates effective transfer learning to related optimization problems.</p></details> |  |

Primal heuristics play a crucial role in quickly finding feasible solutions for NP-hard ILP. Although $\textit{end-to-end learning}$-based primal heuristics (E2EPH) have recently been proposed, they are typically unable to independently generate feasible solutions and mainly focus on binary variables. Ensuring feasibility is critical, especially when handling non-binary integer variables. To address this challenge, we propose RL-SPH, a novel reinforcement learning-based start primal heuristic capable of independently generating feasible solutions, even for ILP involving non-binary integers. Experimental results demonstrate that RL-SPH rapidly obtains high-quality feasible solutions, achieving on average a 44x lower primal gap and a 2.3x lower primal integral compared to existing primal heuristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version (19 pages, 7 figures).

Despite its potential, current software stacks for DRAM-PIM face significant challenges, including reliance on hand-tuned libraries that hinder programmability, limited support for high-level abstractions, and the lack of systematic optimization frameworks. To address these limitations, we present ATiM, a search-based optimizing tensor compiler for UPMEM. Key features of ATiM include: (1) automated searches of the joint search space for host and kernel tensor programs, (2) PIM-aware optimizations for efficiently handling boundary conditions, and (3) improved search algorithms for the expanded search space of UPMEM systems. Our experimental results on UPMEM hardware demonstrate performance gains of up to 6.18$\times$ for various UPMEM benchmark kernels and 8.21$\times$ for GPT-J layers. To the best of our knowledge, ATiM is the first tensor compiler to provide fully automated, autotuning-integrated code generation support for a DRAM-PIM system. By bridging the gap between high-level tensor computation abstractions and low-level hardware-specific requirements, ATiM establishes a foundation for advancing DRAM-PIM programmability and enabling streamlined optimization.</p></details> | 17 pages, 15 figures |

Further, the use of artificial neural networks in symbolic learning has been seen as increasingly relevant recently. To study the capabilities of neural networks in the symbolic AI domain, researchers have explored the ability of deep neural networks to learn mathematical constructions, such as addition and multiplication, logic inference, such as theorem provers, and even the execution of computer programs. The latter is known to be too complex a task for neural networks. Therefore, the results were not always successful, and often required the introduction of biased elements in the learning process, in addition to restricting the scope of possible programs to be executed. In this work, we will analyze the ability of neural networks to learn how to execute programs as a whole. To do so, we propose a different approach. Instead of using an imperative programming language, with complex structures, we use the Lambda Calculus ({\lambda}-Calculus), a simple, but Turing-Complete mathematical formalism, which serves as the basis for modern functional programming languages and is at the heart of computability theory. We will introduce the use of integrated neural learning and lambda calculi formalization. Finally, we explore execution of a program in {\lambda}-Calculus is based on reductions, we will show that it is enough to learn how to perform these reductions so that we can execute any program.

Current evaluations, however, predominantly measure the accuracy of generated code on static benchmarks, neglecting the critical aspect of model robustness during programming tasks. While adversarial attacks offer insights on model robustness, their effectiveness is limited and evaluation could be constrained. Current adversarial attack methods for robustness evaluation yield inconsistent results, struggling to provide a unified evaluation across different LLMs. We introduce EVALOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluate the robustness from a self-consistency perspective, i.e., leveraging the natural duality inherent in popular software engineering tasks, e.g., code generation and code summarization. EVALOOP initiates a self-contained feedback loop: an LLM generates output (e.g., code) from an input (e.g., natural language specification), and then use the generated output as the input to produce a new output (e.g., summarizes that code into a new specification). EVALOOP repeats the process to assess the effectiveness of EVALOOP in each loop. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without rely on any external attack setups, providing a unified metric to evaluate LLMs' robustness in programming. We evaluate 16 prominent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.1, O4-mini) on EVALOOP and found that EVALOOP typically induces a 5.01%-19.31% absolute drop in pass@1 performance within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, GPT-3.5-Turbo, despite superior initial code generation compared to DeepSeek-V2, demonstrated lower robustness over repeated evaluation loop.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |

However, are the abstract reasoning abilities of these models general enough for problems of practical importance? Unlike past work, which has focused mainly on math, coding, and data wrangling, we focus on a historical linguistics-inspired inductive reasoning problem, formulated as Programming by Examples. We develop a fully automated pipeline for dynamically generating a benchmark for this task with controllable difficulty in order to tackle scalability and contamination issues to which many reasoning benchmarks are subject. Using our pipeline, we generate a test set with nearly 1k instances that is challenging for all state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, with the best model (Claude-3.7-Sonnet) achieving a mere 54% pass rate, demonstrating that LCoT LLMs still struggle with a class or reasoning that is ubiquitous in historical linguistics as well as many other domains.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate the relationship between multiple PLs and English in the concept space of LLMs. We perform a few-shot translation task on 21 PL pairs using two Llama-based models. By decoding the embeddings of intermediate layers during this task, we observe that the concept space is closer to English (including PL keywords) and assigns high probabilities to English tokens in the second half of the intermediate layers. We analyze neuron activations for 11 PLs and English, finding that while language-specific neurons are primarily concentrated in the bottom layers, those exclusive to each PL tend to appear in the top layers. For PLs that are highly aligned with multiple other PLs, identifying language-specific neurons is not feasible. These PLs also tend to have a larger keyword set than other PLs and are closer to the model's concept space regardless of the input/output PL in the translation task. Our findings provide insights into how LLMs internally represent PLs, revealing structural patterns in the model's concept space.

To mitigate this problem, we propose a tool-assisted method for formally specifying and automatically verifying the correctness of statistical programs. In this method, programmers are required to annotate the source code of the statistical programs with the requirements for these methods. Through this annotation, they are reminded to check the requirements for statistical methods, including those that cannot be formally verified, such as the distribution of the unknown true population. Our software tool StatWhy automatically checks whether programmers have properly specified the requirements for the statistical methods, thereby identifying any missing requirements that need to be addressed. This tool is implemented using the Why3 platform to verify the correctness of OCaml programs that conduct statistical hypothesis testing. We demonstrate how StatWhy can be used to avoid common errors in various statistical hypothesis testing programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CAV 2025 (the 37th International Conference on Computer Aided Verification)</p></details> |

However, these Gaussian-based asymptotic theories have so far been unable to capture the behavior of attention layers, except under special regimes such as infinitely many heads or tailored scaling schemes. In this paper, leveraging the Tensor Programs framework, we rigorously identify the infinite-width limit distribution of variables within a single attention layer under realistic architectural dimensionality and standard $1/\sqrt{n}$-scaling with $n$ dimensionality. We derive the exact form of this limit law without resorting to infinite-head approximations or tailored scalings, demonstrating that it departs fundamentally from Gaussianity. This limiting distribution exhibits non-Gaussianity from a hierarchical structure, being Gaussian conditional on the random similarity scores. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical predictions, confirming the effectiveness of our theory at finite width and accurate description of finite-head attentions. Beyond characterizing a standalone attention layer, our findings lay the groundwork for developing a unified theory of deep Transformer architectures in the infinite-width regime.</p></details> |  |

Human visual attention refers to the mechanical processes by which we selectively process and prioritize information. Visual attention is important to study because it is central to what information people (who are sighted) use to solve a particular problem. Meanwhile, memory bugs are among the most common types of bugs in C programs that manifest as a variety of program faults. In this paper, we study human visual attention while people attempt to locate memory bugs in code. We recruit 11 programmers to locate between one and six memory bugs in three C programs for 1.5-2 hours each. In total we collected observations of 17 hours of programmer effort. The bugs in our study cover memory leaks, overflows, and double frees, which are among the most common memory bugs. We analyze the task outcomes in terms of success rate and related factors, patterns of visual attention overall such as what lines and functions are read, and finally we explore differences of visual attention patterns during success versus failure cases.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |

Thus, we introduce ProjectEval, a new benchmark for LLM agents project-level code generation's automated evaluation by simulating user interaction. ProjectEval is constructed by LLM with human reviewing. It has three different level inputs of natural languages or code skeletons. ProjectEval can evaluate the generated projects by user interaction simulation for execution, and by code similarity through existing objective indicators. Through ProjectEval, we find that systematic engineering project code, overall understanding of the project and comprehensive analysis capability are the keys for LLM agents to achieve practical projects.

To address this problem, we propose TrickCatcher, an LLM-powered approach to generating test cases for uncovering bugs in plausible programs. TrickCatcher operates in three stages: First, it uses an LLM to generate program variants based on the program under test (PUT) and its specification. Second, it employs an LLM to construct an input generator from the specification for producing test inputs. Finally, these inputs are executed on both the PUT and its program variants to detect inconsistencies in their outputs. We evaluate TrickCatcher on two datasets, TrickyBugs and EvalPlus, which include 366 human-written and 151 AI-generated plausible programs with tricky bugs. TrickCatcher achieves recall, precision, and F1 scores that are 1.80x, 2.65x, and 1.66x those of the state-of-the-art baselines, respectively.

To meet this demand, specialized hardware accelerators are being developed. Optimizing these programs for accelerators is challenging for two reasons: program performance is highly sensitive to variations in sparse inputs, and early-stage accelerators rely on expensive simulators. Therefore, ML-based cost models used for optimizing such programs on general-purpose hardware are often ineffective for early-stage accelerators, as they require large datasets for proper training. To this end, we introduce COGNATE, a novel framework that leverages inexpensive data samples from general-purpose hardware (e.g., CPUs) to train cost models, followed by few-shot fine-tuning on emerging hardware. COGNATE exploits the homogeneity of input features across hardware platforms while effectively mitigating heterogeneity, enabling cost model training with just 5% of the data samples needed by accelerator-specific models to achieve comparable performance. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that COGNATE outperforms existing techniques, achieving average speedups of 1.47x (up to 5.46x) for SpMM and 1.39x (up to 4.22x) for SDDMM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning</p></details> |

In large codebases like the Linux kernel, traditional static analysis tools often generate excessive false positives due to simplified vulnerability modeling and overapproximation of path and data constraints. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate promising code understanding capabilities, their direct application to program analysis remains unreliable due to inherent reasoning limitations. We introduce BugLens, a post-refinement framework that significantly enhances static analysis precision for bug detection. BugLens guides LLMs through structured reasoning steps to assess security impact and validate constraints from the source code. When evaluated on Linux kernel taint-style bugs detected by static analysis tools, BugLens improves precision approximately 7-fold (from 0.10 to 0.72), substantially reducing false positives while uncovering four previously unreported vulnerabilities. Our results demonstrate that a well-structured, fully automated LLM-based workflow can effectively complement and enhance traditional static analysis techniques.</p></details> |  |

In particular, Code Snippets (CSs) are approved to be an effective way of introducing programming language units to students. CSs are portions of source code of varying size and content. They can be used in a myriad of ways, one of which is to teach the code they contain as well as its function. To further explore the use of CSs, a pedagogical summer internship project was set up at the Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG). The scope of the considerations for the study derives from an educational standpoint. Within the evaluations made, the focus was primarily given to pieces of information which proved to provide evidence pertaining to the methodology involved in either teaching or developing teaching materials. By taking the results produced into account from a pedagogical perspective, it was found that several qualities of popular code snippet tutorials which benefit or hinder the learning process, including code length, interactivity, further support, and quality of explanation. These qualities are then combined and used to present a plan for the design of an effective learning resource which makes use of code snippets.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 3 figures, 2023 UK and Ireland Engineering Education Research Network Conference</p></details> |

Conventional training via back-propagation (BP) with losses like Mean Squared Error or Cross-Entropy often requires extensive iterations and may converge sub-optimally. Quantum computing offers a promising alternative by leveraging superposition, tunneling, and entanglement to search complex optimization landscapes more efficiently. In this work, we propose a hybrid optimization method that combines an Unconstrained Binary Quadratic Programming (UBQP) formulation with Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) to accelerate CNN training. Evaluated on the MNIST dataset, our approach achieves a 10--15\% accuracy improvement over a standard BP-CNN baseline while maintaining similar execution times. These results illustrate the potential of hybrid quantum-classical techniques in High-Performance Computing (HPC) environments for Big Data and Deep Learning.

Although classical architectures typically implement variable binding via addressable memory, it is not well understood how modern neural networks lacking built-in binding operations may acquire this capacity. We investigate this by training a Transformer to dereference queried variables in symbolic programs where variables are assigned either numerical constants or other variables. Each program requires following chains of variable assignments up to four steps deep to find the queried value, and also contains irrelevant chains of assignments acting as distractors. Our analysis reveals a developmental trajectory with three distinct phases during training: (1) random prediction of numerical constants, (2) a shallow heuristic prioritizing early variable assignments, and (3) the emergence of a systematic mechanism for dereferencing assignment chains. Using causal interventions, we find that the model learns to exploit the residual stream as an addressable memory space, with specialized attention heads routing information across token positions. This mechanism allows the model to dynamically track variable bindings across layers, resulting in accurate dereferencing. Our results show how Transformer models can learn to implement systematic variable binding without explicit architectural support, bridging connectionist and symbolic approaches.

Finite incremental gains provide a quantitative measure of robustness for trajectories, and will ensure that all pairs of trajectories will converge to a fixed point or will diverge together in the absence of an applied input. Upper-bounds on these incremental gains can be computed through linear programming. Computation and regulation of the $\ell_1$ and $\ell_\infty$ incremental gains are verified by numerical examples.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 images |
| **[Improving Parallel Program Performance with LLM Optimizers via Agent-System Interfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15625v4)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern scientific discovery increasingly relies on high-performance computing for complex modeling and simulation. A key challenge in improving parallel program performance is efficiently mapping tasks to processors and data to memory, a process dictated by intricate, low-level system code known as mappers. Developing high-performance mappers demands days of manual tuning, posing a significant barrier for domain scientists without systems expertise. We introduce a framework that automates mapper development with generative optimization, leveraging richer feedback beyond scalar performance metrics. Our approach features the Agent-System Interface, which includes a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to abstract away the low-level complexity of system code and define a structured search space, as well as AutoGuide, a mechanism that interprets raw execution output into actionable feedback. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning methods such as OpenTuner, which rely solely on scalar feedback, our method finds superior mappers in far fewer iterations. With just 10 iterations, it outperforms OpenTuner even after 1000 iterations, achieving 3.8X faster performance. Our approach finds mappers that surpass expert-written mappers by up to 1.34X speedup across nine benchmarks while reducing tuning time from days to minutes.</p></details> |  |

This paper evaluates the capabilities of the Llama 2-70B model in automating these tasks for scientific applications written in commonly used programming languages. Using representative test problems, we assess the model's capacity to generate code, documentation, and unit tests, as well as its ability to translate existing code between commonly used programming languages. Our comprehensive analysis evaluates the compilation, runtime behavior, and correctness of the generated and translated code. Additionally, we assess the quality of automatically generated code, documentation and unit tests. Our results indicate that while Llama 2-70B frequently generates syntactically correct and functional code for simpler numerical tasks, it encounters substantial difficulties with more complex, parallelized, or distributed computations, requiring considerable manual corrections. We identify key limitations and suggest areas for future improvements to better leverage AI-driven automation in scientific computing workflows.</p></details> |  |

A Comprehensive Evaluation of LLMs on Formal Specification Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04779v4)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to automate programming tasks. Yet, LLMs' capabilities in reasoning about program semantics are still inadequately studied, leaving significant potential for further exploration. This paper introduces FormalBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities on program semantics, particularly via the task of synthesizing formal program specifications to assist verifying program correctness. This task requires both comprehensive reasoning over all possible program executions and the generation of precise, syntactically correct expressions that adhere to formal syntax and semantics. Using this benchmark, we evaluated the ability of LLMs in synthesizing consistent and complete specifications. Our findings show that LLMs perform well with simple control flows but struggle with more complex structures, especially loops, even with advanced prompting. Additionally, LLMs exhibit limited robustness against semantic-preserving transformations. We also highlight common failure patterns and design self-repair prompts, improving success rates by 25%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Main Conference)</p></details> |
| **[Integer Programming for Generalized Causal Bootstrap Designs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21464v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In experimental causal inference, we distinguish between two sources of uncertainty: design uncertainty, due to the treatment assignment mechanism, and sampling uncertainty, when the sample is drawn from a super-population. This distinction matters in settings with small fixed samples and heterogeneous treatment effects, as in geographical experiments. The standard bootstrap procedure most often used by practitioners primarily estimates sampling uncertainty, and the causal bootstrap procedure, which accounts for design uncertainty, was developed for the completely randomized design and the difference-in-means estimator, whereas non-standard designs and estimators are often used in these low-power regimes. We address this gap by proposing an integer program which computes numerically the worst-case copula used as an input to the causal bootstrap method, in a wide range of settings. Specifically, we prove the asymptotic validity of our approach for unconfounded, conditionally unconfounded, and and individualistic with bounded confoundedness assignments, as well as generalizing to any linear-in-treatment and quadratic-in-treatment estimators. We demonstrate the refined confidence intervals achieved through simulations of small geographical experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Training Language Models to Generate Quality Code with Program Analysis Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22704v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation with large language models (LLMs), often termed vibe coding, is increasingly adopted in production but fails to ensure code quality, particularly in security (e.g., SQL injection vulnerabilities) and maintainability (e.g., missing type annotations). Existing methods, such as supervised fine-tuning and rule-based post-processing, rely on labor-intensive annotations or brittle heuristics, limiting their scalability and effectiveness. We propose REAL, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes LLMs to generate production-quality code using program analysis-guided feedback. Specifically, REAL integrates two automated signals: (1) program analysis detecting security or maintainability defects and (2) unit tests ensuring functional correctness. Unlike prior work, our framework is prompt-agnostic and reference-free, enabling scalable supervision without manual intervention. Experiments across multiple datasets and model scales demonstrate that REAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in simultaneous assessments of functionality and code quality. Our work bridges the gap between rapid prototyping and production-ready code, enabling LLMs to deliver both speed and quality.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

In practical design workflows, designers often engage in time-consuming reviews and refinements of these prototypes by comparing them with reference images. To bridge this gap, we introduce the CAD review task to automatically detect and correct potential errors, ensuring consistency between the constructed 3D objects and reference images. However, recent advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to recognize multiple geometric components and perform spatial geometric operations within the CAD program, leading to inaccurate reviews. In this paper, we propose the CAD program repairer (ReCAD) framework to effectively detect program errors and provide helpful feedback on error correction. Additionally, we create a dataset, CADReview, consisting of over 20K program-image pairs, with diverse errors for the CAD review task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReCAD significantly outperforms existing MLLMs, which shows great potential in design applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |
| **[(Near)-Optimal Algorithms for Sparse Separable Convex Integer Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22212v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the general integer programming (IP) problem of optimizing a separable convex function over the integer points of a polytope: $\min \{f(\mathbf{x}) \mid A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}, \, \mathbf{l} \leq \mathbf{x} \leq \mathbf{u}, \, \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{Z}^n\}$. The number of variables $n$ is a variable part of the input, and we consider the regime where the constraint matrix $A$ has small coefficients $\|A\|_\infty$ and small primal or dual treedepth $\mathrm{td}_P(A)$ or $\mathrm{td}_D(A)$, respectively. Equivalently, we consider block-structured matrices, in particular $n$-fold, tree-fold, $2$-stage and multi-stage matrices. We ask about the possibility of near-linear time algorithms in the general case of (non-linear) separable convex functions. The techniques of previous works for the linear case are inherently limited to it; in fact, no strongly-polynomial algorithm may exist due to a simple unconditional information-theoretic lower bound of $n \log \|\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{l}\|_\infty$, where $\mathbf{l}, \mathbf{u}$ are the vectors of lower and upper bounds. Our first result is that with parameters $\mathrm{td}_P(A)$ and $\|A\|_\infty$, this lower bound can be matched (up to dependency on the parameters). Second, with parameters $\mathrm{td}_D(A)$ and $\|A\|_\infty$, the situation is more involved, and we design an algorithm with time complexity $g(\mathrm{td}_D(A), \|A\|_\infty) n \log n \log \|\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{l}\|_\infty$ where $g$ is some computable function. We conjecture that a stronger lower bound is possible in this regime, and our algorithm is in fact optimal. Our algorithms combine ideas from scaling, proximity, and sensitivity of integer programs, together with a new dynamic data structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, will appear at IPCO 2025</p></details> |
| **[Symbolically Regressing Fish Biomass Spectral Data: A Linear Genetic Programming Method with Tunable Primitives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21901v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning techniques play an important role in analyzing spectral data. The spectral data of fish biomass is useful in fish production, as it carries many important chemistry properties of fish meat. However, it is challenging for existing machine learning techniques to comprehensively discover hidden patterns from fish biomass spectral data since the spectral data often have a lot of noises while the training data are quite limited. To better analyze fish biomass spectral data, this paper models it as a symbolic regression problem and solves it by a linear genetic programming method with newly proposed tunable primitives. In the symbolic regression problem, linear genetic programming automatically synthesizes regression models based on the given primitives and training data. The tunable primitives further improve the approximation ability of the regression models by tuning their inherent coefficients. Our empirical results over ten fish biomass targets show that the proposed method improves the overall performance of fish biomass composition prediction. The synthesized regression models are compact and have good interpretability, which allow us to highlight useful features over the spectrum. Our further investigation also verifies the good generality of the proposed method across various spectral data treatments and other symbolic regression problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Hypothesis Generation: LLM-Automated Language Bias for Inductive Logic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21486v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating robust hypothesis generation in open environments is pivotal for AI cognition. We introduce a novel framework integrating a multi-agent system, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), with Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). Our system's LLM agents autonomously define a structured symbolic vocabulary (predicates) and relational templates , i.e., \emph{language bias} directly from raw textual data. This automated symbolic grounding (the construction of the language bias), traditionally an expert-driven bottleneck for ILP, then guides the transformation of text into facts for an ILP solver, which inductively learns interpretable rules. This approach overcomes traditional ILP's reliance on predefined symbolic structures and the noise-sensitivity of pure LLM methods. Extensive experiments in diverse, challenging scenarios validate superior performance, paving a new path for automated, explainable, and verifiable hypothesis generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Understand Symbolic Graphics Programs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08313v4)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Against the backdrop of enthusiasm for large language models (LLMs), there is a growing need to scientifically assess their capabilities and shortcomings. This is nontrivial in part because it is difficult to find tasks which the models have not encountered during training. Utilizing symbolic graphics programs, we propose a domain well-suited to test multiple spatial-semantic reasoning skills of LLMs. Popular in computer graphics, these programs procedurally generate visual data. While LLMs exhibit impressive skills in general program synthesis and analysis, symbolic graphics programs offer a new layer of evaluation: they allow us to test an LLM's ability to answer semantic questions about the images or 3D geometries without a vision encoder. To semantically understand the symbolic programs, LLMs would need to possess the ability to "imagine" and reason how the corresponding graphics content would look with only the symbolic description of the local curvatures and strokes. We use this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the semantic visual understanding of symbolic graphics programs, built procedurally with minimal human effort. Particular emphasis is placed on transformations of images that leave the image level semantics invariant while introducing significant changes to the underlying program. We evaluate commercial and open-source LLMs on our benchmark to assess their ability to reason about visual output of programs, finding that LLMs considered stronger at reasoning generally perform better. Lastly, we introduce a novel method to improve this ability -- Symbolic Instruction Tuning (SIT), in which the LLM is finetuned with pre-collected instruction data on symbolic graphics programs. Interestingly, we find that SIT not only improves LLM's understanding on symbolic programs, but it also improves general reasoning ability on various other benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Spotlight (v4: 47 pages, 26 figures, project page: https://sgp-bench.github.io/)</p></details> |
| **[BIPNN: Learning to Solve Binary Integer Programming via Hypergraph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20997v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary (0-1) integer programming (BIP) is pivotal in scientific domains requiring discrete decision-making. As the advance of AI computing, recent works explore neural network-based solvers for integer linear programming (ILP) problems. Yet, they lack scalability for tackling nonlinear challenges. To handle nonlinearities, state-of-the-art Branch-and-Cut solvers employ linear relaxations, leading to exponential growth in auxiliary variables and severe computation limitations. To overcome these limitations, we propose BIPNN (Binary Integer Programming Neural Network), an unsupervised learning framework to solve nonlinear BIP problems via hypergraph neural networks (HyperGNN). Specifically, BIPNN reformulates BIPs-constrained, discrete, and nonlinear (sin, log, exp) optimization problems-into unconstrained, differentiable, and polynomial loss functions. The reformulation stems from the observation of a precise one-to-one mapping between polynomial BIP objectives and hypergraph structures, enabling the unsupervised training of HyperGNN to optimize BIP problems in an end-to-end manner. On this basis, we propose a GPU-accelerated and continuous-annealing-enhanced training pipeline for BIPNN. The pipeline enables BIPNN to optimize large-scale nonlinear terms in BIPs fully in parallel via straightforward gradient descent, thus significantly reducing the training cost while ensuring the generation of discrete, high-quality solutions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets highlight the superiority of our approach.</p></details> |  |

The guard specifies the condition for entering an atomic region. That is a convenient model for the specification and verification of concurrent programs, but has eschewed efficient execution so far. This article shows how guarded atomic actions, when attached to objects, can be implemented highly efficiently using a combination of coroutines, operating-system worker threads, and dedicated management of object queues and stacks. The efficiency of an experimental language, Lime, is shown to compare favourably with that of C/Pthreads, Go, Erlang, Java, and Haskell on synthetic benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings PLACES 2025, arXiv:2505.19078</p></details> |

The design of CLASS and the strong static guarantees of its type system originates in its Linear Logic and proposition-as-types foundations. However, instead of focusing on its theoretical foundations, this paper briefly illustrates, in a tutorial form, an identifiable CLASS session-based programming style where strong correctness properties are automatically ensured by type-checking. Our more challenging examples include concurrent thread and memory-safe mutable ADTs, lazy stream programming, and manipulation of linear digital assets as used in smart contracts.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings PLACES 2025, arXiv:2505.19078</p></details> |

However, LLMs often fail to effectively self-verify and generate correct feedback, further misleading refinement and leading to the failure of self-correction, especially in complex reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Program-driven Self-Correction (ProgCo). First, program-driven verification (ProgVe) achieves complex verification logic and extensive validation through self-generated, self-executing verification pseudo-programs. Then, program-driven refinement (ProgRe) receives feedback from ProgVe, conducts dual reflection and refinement on both responses and verification programs to mitigate misleading of incorrect feedback in complex reasoning tasks. Experiments on three instruction-following and mathematical benchmarks indicate that ProgCo achieves effective self-correction, and can be further enhance performance when combined with real program tools. We release our code at https://github.com/songxiaoshuai/progco.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted at ACL2025 Main</p></details> |

However, the lack of sufficient and high-quality programming data, combined with the mismatch between offline evaluation and real-world learning, hinders the practical deployment of such systems. To address this challenge, many approaches attempt to simulate learner practice data, yet they often overlook the fine-grained, iterative nature of programming learning, resulting in a lack of interpretability and granularity. To fill this gap, we propose a LLM-based agent, CoderAgent, to simulate students' programming processes in a fine-grained manner without relying on real data. Specifically, we equip each human learner with an intelligent agent, the core of which lies in capturing the cognitive states of the human programming practice process. Inspired by ACT-R, a cognitive architecture framework, we design the structure of CoderAgent to align with human cognitive architecture by focusing on the mastery of programming knowledge and the application of coding ability. Recognizing the inherent patterns in multi-layered cognitive reasoning, we introduce the Programming Tree of Thought (PTOT), which breaks down the process into four steps: why, how, where, and what. This approach enables a detailed analysis of iterative problem-solving strategies. Finally, experimental evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that CoderAgent provides interpretable insights into learning trajectories and achieves accurate simulations, paving the way for personalized programming education.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI2025</p></details> |

Our method alternates between feature selection and clustering, without requiring precise estimation of sparse model parameters. Feature selection is performed by thresholding a rough estimate of the discriminative direction, while clustering is carried out via a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation of K-means. In the isotropic case, the algorithm is motivated by the minimax separation bound for exact recovery of cluster labels using varying sparse subsets of features. This bound highlights the critical role of variable selection in achieving exact recovery. We further extend the algorithm to settings with unknown sparse precision matrices, avoiding full model parameter estimation by computing only the minimally required quantities. Across a range of simulation settings, we find that the proposed iterative approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, especially in higher dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>107 p...</summary><p>107 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, 6 algorithms; Main text 21 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, 3 algorithms</p></details> |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful mathematical capabilities, and the Chain-of-Thought technique, which guides LLMs through step-by-step reasoning, has yielded impressive results. However, this reasoning ability is limited by the computational weaknesses of LLMs themselves, where calculation errors can accumulate, leading to incorrect final answers. To address this, we propose Program of Equations Thoughts (POET), which transforms the task of generating step-by-step reasoning answers into a two-stage task of predicting equations and generating code, offloading complex computations to a Python interpreter to avoid calculation errors in LLMs. Furthermore, we propose Zero-shot POET, which utilizes a manually designed template to enable LLMs to directly generate Python code for one-step solving. Our method achieves accuracies of 95.3% and 98.0% on the PEN and ALG514 datasets, respectively, setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Zero-shot POET also achieves the SOTA result of 95.5% on the DRAW-1K dataset.</p></details> |  |

This work presents a computational methodology for searching for pathways in reaction networks which is based on integer linear programming and the modeling of reaction networks by directed hypergraphs. Often multiple pathways fit the given search criteria. To rank them, we develop an objective function based on physical arguments maximizing the probability of the pathway. We furthermore develop an automated pipeline to estimate the energy barriers of individual reactions in reaction networks. Combined, the methodology facilitates flexible and kinetically informed pathway investigations on large reaction networks by computational means, even for networks coming without kinetic annotation, such as those created via generative approaches for expanding molecular spaces.</p></details> | 29 pages |

We propose a low-cost visual program distillation method that can be used for models with at most 1 billion parameters and requires no human-generated program annotations. We achieve this through synthetic data augmentation based on decoupling programs into higher-level skills, called templates, and their corresponding arguments. Experimental results show that, with a relatively small amount of question/answer data, small language models can generate high-quality specialized visual programs with the added benefit of much faster inference</p></details> |  |
| **[Weighted Pseudorandom Generators for Read-Once Branching Programs via Weighted Pseudorandom Reductions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08272v2)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study weighted pseudorandom generators (WPRGs) and derandomizations for read-once branching programs (ROBPs). Denote $n$ and $w$ as the length and the width of a ROBP. We have the following results. For standard ROBPs, there exists an explicit $\varepsilon$-WPRG with seed length $$ O\left(\frac{\log n\log (nw)}{\max\left\{1,\log\log w-\log\log n\right\}}+\log w \left(\log\log\log w-\log\log\max\left\{2,\frac{\log w}{\log n/\varepsilon}\right\}\right)+\log(1/\varepsilon)\right).$$ When $n = w^{o(1)},$ this is better than the constructions in Hoza (RANDOM 2022), Cohen, Doron, Renard, Sberlo, and Ta-Shma (CCC 2021).Further, by using this result in a black-box way, we attain a WPRG for regular ROBPs with seed length $$O\left(\log n\left(\sqrt{\log(1/\varepsilon)}+\log w+\log\log n\right)+\log(1/\varepsilon)\right).$$ This slightly improves the result of Chen, Hoza, Lyu, Tal, and Wu (FOCS 2023) and matches the recent simultaneous and independent work of Chen and Ta-shma. For permutation ROBPs with unbounded widths and single accept nodes, there exists an explicit $\varepsilon$-WPRG with seed length $$ O\left( \log n\left( \log\log n + \sqrt{\log(1/\varepsilon)} \right)+\log(1/\varepsilon)\right). $$ This slightly improves the result of Chen, Hoza, Lyu, Tal, and Wu (FOCS 2023). For regular ROBPs with $n \leq 2^{O(\sqrt{\log w})}, \varepsilon = 1/\text{poly} w$, we give a derandomization within space $O(\log w)$, i.e. in $\mathbf{L}$ exactly. This is better than previous results of Ahmadinejad, Kelner, Murtagh, Peebles, Sidford, and Vadhan (FOCS 2020) in this regime, and we improves the time complexity from super-polynomial to standard polynomial. Our main method is based on a recursive application of weighted pseudorandom reductions, which is a natural notion that is used to simplify ROBPs.</p></details> |  |

However, the complexity of modern bugs often makes precise root cause analysis difficult and unreliable. To address this challenge, we propose crash-site repair to simplify the repair task while still mitigating the risk of exploitation. In addition, we introduce a template-guided patch generation approach that significantly reduces the token cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining both efficiency and effectiveness. We implement our prototype system, WILLIAMT, and evaluate it against state-of-the-art APR tools. Our results show that, when combined with the top-performing agent CodeRover-S, WILLIAMT reduces token cost by 45.9% and increases the bug-fixing rate to 73.5% (+29.6%) on ARVO, a ground-truth open source software vulnerabilities benchmark. Furthermore, we demonstrate that WILLIAMT can function effectively even without access to frontier LLMs: even a local model running on a Mac M4 Mini achieves a reasonable repair rate. These findings highlight the broad applicability and scalability of WILLIAMT.</p></details> |  |

Critical obstacles include the design of effective data encoding strategies and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which are vital for the performance of QML models. Furthermore, the measurement process is often neglected-most existing QML models employ predefined measurement schemes that may not align with the specific requirements of the targeted problem. We propose an innovative framework that renders the observable of a quantum system-specifically, the Hermitian matrix-trainable. This approach employs an end-to-end differentiable learning framework, enabling simultaneous optimization of the neural network used to program the parameterized observables and the standard quantum circuit parameters. Notably, the quantum observable parameters are dynamically programmed by the neural network, allowing the observables to adapt in real time based on the input data stream. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method effectively programs observables dynamically within variational quantum circuits, achieving superior results compared to existing approaches. Notably, it delivers enhanced performance metrics, such as higher classification accuracy, thereby significantly improving the overall effectiveness of QML models.</p></details> |  |

However, manual classification is labor-intensive and difficult to scale to large chemical databases. Existing automated approaches either rely on manually constructed classification rules, or the use of deep learning methods that lack explainability. This work presents an approach that uses generative artificial intelligence to automatically write chemical classifier programs for classes in the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) database. These programs can be used for efficient deterministic run-time classification of SMILES structures, with natural language explanations. The programs themselves constitute an explainable computable ontological model of chemical class nomenclature, which we call the ChEBI Chemical Class Program Ontology (C3PO). We validated our approach against the ChEBI database, and compared our results against state of the art deep learning models. We also demonstrate the use of C3PO to classify out-of-distribution examples taken from metabolomics repositories and natural product databases. We also demonstrate the potential use of our approach to find systematic classification errors in existing chemical databases, and show how an ensemble artificial intelligence approach combining generated ontologies, automated literature search, and multimodal vision models can be used to pinpoint potential errors requiring expert validation</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning With Preference Optimization For Visual Program Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16529v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual programming languages (VPLs) allow users to create programs through graphical interfaces, which results in easier accessibility and their widespread usage in various domains. To further enhance this accessibility, recent research has focused on generating VPL code from user instructions using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, by employing prompting-based methods, these studies have shown promising results. Nevertheless, such approaches can be less effective for industrial VPLs such as Ladder Diagram (LD). LD is a pivotal language used in industrial automation processes and involves extensive domain-specific configurations, which are difficult to capture in a single prompt. In this work, we demonstrate that training-based methods outperform prompting-based methods for LD generation accuracy, even with smaller backbone models. Building on these findings, we propose a two-stage training strategy to further enhance VPL generation. First, we employ retrieval-augmented fine-tuning to leverage the repetitive use of subroutines commonly seen in industrial VPLs. Second, we apply direct preference optimization (DPO) to further guide the model toward accurate outputs, using systematically generated preference pairs through graph editing operations. Extensive experiments on real-world LD data demonstrate that our approach improves program-level accuracy by over 10% compared to supervised fine-tuning, which highlights its potential to advance industrial automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2025 (Main, long paper)</p></details> |
| **[Gradient-Based Program Repair: Fixing Bugs in Continuous Program Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17703v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic program repair seeks to generate correct code from buggy programs, with most approaches searching the correct program in a discrete, symbolic space of source code tokens. This symbolic search is fundamentally limited by its inability to directly reason about program behavior. We introduce Gradient-Based Program Repair (GBPR), a new paradigm that reframes program repair as continuous optimization in a differentiable numerical program space. Our core insight is to compile symbolic programs into differentiable numerical representations, enabling search in the numerical program space directly guided by program behavior. To evaluate GBPR, we present RaspBugs, a new benchmark of 1,466 buggy symbolic RASP programs and their respective numerical representations. Our experiments demonstrate that GBPR can effectively repair buggy symbolic programs by gradient-based optimization in the numerical program space, with convincing repair trajectories. To our knowledge, we are the first to state program repair as continuous optimization in a numerical program space. Our work establishes a new direction for program repair research, bridging two rich worlds: continuous optimization and program behavior.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoGramBench: Benchmarking the Geometric Program Reasoning in Modern LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17653v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geometric spatial reasoning forms the foundation of many applications in artificial intelligence, yet the ability of large language models (LLMs) to operate over geometric spatial information expressed in procedural code remains underexplored. In this paper, we address this gap by formalizing the Program-to-Geometry task, which challenges models to translate programmatic drawing code into accurate and abstract geometric reasoning. To evaluate this capability, we present GeoGramBench, a benchmark of 500 carefully refined problems organized by a tailored three-level taxonomy that considers geometric complexity rather than traditional mathematical reasoning complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier LLMs reveals consistent and pronounced deficiencies: even the most advanced models achieve less than 50% accuracy at the highest abstraction level. These results highlight the unique challenges posed by program-driven spatial reasoning and establish GeoGramBench as a valuable resource for advancing research in symbolic-to-spatial geometric reasoning.

However, the training of TAL models requires a substantial amount of manually annotated data. Data programming is an efficient method to create training labels with a series of human-defined labeling functions. However, its application in TAL faces difficulties of defining complex actions in the context of temporal video frames. In this paper, we propose ProTAL, a drag-and-link video programming framework for TAL. ProTAL enables users to define \textbf{key events} by dragging nodes representing body parts and objects and linking them to constrain the relations (direction, distance, etc.). These definitions are used to generate action labels for large-scale unlabelled videos. A semi-supervised method is then employed to train TAL models with such labels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProTAL through a usage scenario and a user study, providing insights into designing video programming framework.</p></details> | Accepted at CHI'25 |
| **[Planning-Driven Programming: A Large Language Model Programming Workflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14503v3)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The strong performance of large language models (LLMs) raises extensive discussion on their application to code generation. Recent research suggests continuous program refinements through visible tests to improve code generation accuracy in LLMs. However, these methods suffer from LLMs' inefficiency and limited reasoning capacity. In this work, we propose an LLM programming workflow (LPW) designed to improve both initial code generation and subsequent refinements within a structured two-phase workflow. Specifically, the solution generation phase formulates a solution plan, which is then verified through visible tests to specify the intended natural language solution. Subsequently, the code implementation phase drafts an initial code according to the solution plan and its verification. If the generated code fails the visible tests, the plan verification serves as the intended solution to consistently inform the refinement process for correcting bugs. Compared to state-of-the-art methods across various existing LLMs, LPW significantly improves the Pass@1 accuracy by up to 16.4% on well-established text-to-code generation benchmarks. LPW also sets new state-of-the-art Pass@1 accuracy, achieving 98.2% on HumanEval, 84.8% on MBPP, 59.3% on LiveCode, 62.6% on APPS, and 34.7% on CodeContest, using GPT-4o as the backbone.

| **[From a Constraint Logic Programming Language to a Formal Verification Tool](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17350v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>{log} (read 'setlog') was born as a Constraint Logic Programming (CLP) language where sets and binary relations are first-class citizens, thus fostering set programming. Internally, {log} is a constraint satisfiability solver implementing decision procedures for several fragments of set theory. Hence, {log} can be used as a declarative, set, logic programming language and as an automated theorem prover for set theory. Over time {log} has been extended with some components integrated to the satisfiability solver thus providing a formal verification environment. In this paper we make a comprehensive presentation of this environment which includes a language for the description of state machines based on set theory, an interactive environment for the execution of functional scenarios over state machines, a generator of verification conditions for state machines, automated verification of state machines, and test case generation. State machines are both, programs and specifications; exactly the same code works as a program and as its specification. In this way, with a few additions, a CLP language turned into a seamlessly integrated programming and automated proof system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Theory and Practice of Logic Programming</p></details> |
| **[Towards Better Understanding of Program-of-Thought Reasoning in Cross-Lingual and Multilingual Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17956v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-step reasoning is essential for large language models (LLMs), yet multilingual performance remains challenging. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning, it struggles with non-English languages due to the entanglement of reasoning and execution. Program-of-Thought (PoT) prompting separates reasoning from execution, offering a promising alternative but shifting the challenge to generating programs from non-English questions. We propose a framework to evaluate PoT by separating multilingual reasoning from code execution to examine (i) the impact of fine-tuning on question-reasoning alignment and (ii) how reasoning quality affects answer correctness. Our findings demonstrate that PoT fine-tuning substantially enhances multilingual reasoning, outperforming CoT fine-tuned models. We further demonstrate a strong correlation between reasoning quality (measured through code quality) and answer accuracy, highlighting its potential as a test-time performance improvement heuristic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed alternating gradient descent for convex semi-infinite programs over a network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.11937v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a first-order distributed algorithm for solving a convex semi-infinite program (SIP) over a time-varying network. In this setting, the objective function associated with the optimization problem is a summation of a set of functions, each held by one node in a network. The semi-infinite constraint, on the other hand, is known to all agents. The nodes collectively aim to solve the problem using local data about the objective and limited communication capabilities depending on the network topology. Our algorithm is built on three key ingredients: consensus step, gradient descent in the local objective, and local gradient descent iterations in the constraint at a node when the estimate violates the semi-infinite constraint. The algorithm is constructed, and its parameters are prescribed in such a way that the iterates held by each agent provably converge to an optimizer. That is, as the algorithm progresses, the estimates achieve consensus, and the constraint violation and the error in the optimal value are bounded above by vanishing terms. Simulation examples illustrate our results.</p></details> | 16 pages, 1 figure |

Thus, our work serves a three-fold purpose: First, we present the first taxonomy of human feedback consolidating the entire programming process, which promotes fine-grained evaluation. Second, we introduce ELABORATIONSET, a novel programming dataset specifically designed for human-LLM collaboration, meticulously annotated to enable large-scale simulated human feedback and facilitate costeffective real human interaction studies. Third, we introduce ELABORATION, a novel benchmark to facilitate a thorough assessment of human-LLM competitive programming.

Song et al. The v7.3 introduced a new Clang-based C++ front-end to address the challenges posed by modern C++ programs. Although the new front-end has demonstrated significant potential in previous studies, it remains in the developmental stage and lacks several essential features. ESBMC v7.6 further enhanced this foundation by adding and extending features based on the Clang AST, such as 1) exception handling, 2) extended memory management and memory safety verification, including dangling pointers, duplicate deallocation, memory leaks and rvalue references and 3) new operational models for STL updating the outdated C++ operational models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ESBMC v7.6 can handle a significantly broader range of C++ features introduced in recent versions of the C++ standard.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 2 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2308.05649</p></details> |
| **[Agentic AI Software Engineers: Programming with Trust](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13767v3)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown surprising proficiency in generating code snippets, promising to automate large parts of software engineering via artificial intelligence (AI). We argue that successfully deploying AI software engineers requires a level of trust equal to or even greater than the trust established by human-driven software engineering practices. The recent trend toward LLM agents offers a path toward integrating the power of LLMs to create new code with the power of analysis tools to increase trust in the code. This opinion piece comments on whether LLM agents could dominate software engineering workflows in the future and whether the focus of programming will shift from programming at scale to programming with trust.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[Logic-of-Thought: Empowering Large Language Models with Logic Programs for Solving Puzzles in Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16114v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving puzzles in natural language poses a long-standing challenge in AI. While large language models (LLMs) have recently shown impressive capabilities in a variety of tasks, they continue to struggle with complex puzzles that demand precise reasoning and exhaustive search. In this paper, we propose Logic-of-Thought (Logot), a novel framework that bridges LLMs with logic programming to address this problem. Our method leverages LLMs to translate puzzle rules and states into answer set programs (ASPs), the solution of which are then accurately and efficiently inferred by an ASP interpreter. This hybrid approach combines the natural language understanding of LLMs with the precise reasoning capabilities of logic programs. We evaluate our method on various grid puzzles and dynamic puzzles involving actions, demonstrating near-perfect accuracy across all tasks.
