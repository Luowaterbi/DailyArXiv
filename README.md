| **[Bridging Online and Offline RL: Contextual Bandit Learning for Multi-Turn Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03806v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, there have been significant research interests in training large language models (LLMs) with reinforcement learning (RL) on real-world tasks, such as multi-turn code generation. While online RL tends to perform better than offline RL, its higher training cost and instability hinders wide adoption. In this paper, we build on the observation that multi-turn code generation can be formulated as a one-step recoverable Markov decision process and propose contextual bandit learning with offline trajectories (Cobalt), a new method that combines the benefits of online and offline RL. Cobalt first collects code generation trajectories using a reference LLM and divides them into partial trajectories as contextual prompts. Then, during online bandit learning, the LLM is trained to complete each partial trajectory prompt through single-step code generation. Cobalt outperforms two multi-turn online RL baselines based on GRPO and VeRPO, and substantially improves R1-Distill 8B and Qwen3 8B by up to 9.0 and 6.2 absolute Pass@1 scores on LiveCodeBench. Also, we analyze LLMs' in-context reward hacking behaviors and augment Cobalt training with perturbed trajectories to mitigate this issue. Overall, our results demonstrate Cobalt as a promising solution for iterative decision-making tasks like multi-turn code generation.

However, existing code agents tend to only generate frontend web pages, masking the lack of real full-stack data processing and storage with fancy visual effects. Notably, constructing production-level full-stack web applications is far more challenging than only generating frontend web pages, demanding careful control of data flow, comprehensive understanding of constantly updating packages and dependencies, and accurate localization of obscure bugs in the codebase. To address these difficulties, we introduce FullStack-Agent, a unified agent system for full-stack agentic coding that consists of three parts: (1) FullStack-Dev, a multi-agent framework with strong planning, code editing, codebase navigation, and bug localization abilities. (2) FullStack-Learn, an innovative data-scaling and self-improving method that back-translates crawled and synthesized website repositories to improve the backbone LLM of FullStack-Dev. (3) FullStack-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically tests the frontend, backend and database functionalities of the generated website. Our FullStack-Dev outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method by 8.7%, 38.2%, and 15.9% on the frontend, backend, and database test cases respectively. Additionally, FullStack-Learn raises the performance of a 30B model by 9.7%, 9.5%, and 2.8% on the three sets of test cases through self-improvement, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach. The code is released at https://github.com/mnluzimu/FullStack-Agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[How to Trick Your AI TA: A Systematic Study of Academic Jailbreaking in LLM Code Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10415v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic judges for code evaluation is becoming increasingly prevalent in academic environments. But their reliability can be compromised by students who may employ adversarial prompting strategies in order to induce misgrading and secure undeserved academic advantages. In this paper, we present the first large-scale study of jailbreaking LLM-based automated code evaluators in academic context. Our contributions are: (i) We systematically adapt 20+ jailbreaking strategies for jailbreaking AI code evaluators in the academic context, defining a new class of attacks termed academic jailbreaking. (ii) We release a poisoned dataset of 25K adversarial student submissions, specifically designed for the academic code-evaluation setting, sourced from diverse real-world coursework and paired with rubrics and human-graded references, and (iii) In order to capture the multidimensional impact of academic jailbreaking, we systematically adapt and define three jailbreaking metrics (Jailbreak Success Rate, Score Inflation, and Harmfulness). (iv) We comprehensively evalulate the academic jailbreaking attacks using six LLMs. We find that these models exhibit significant vulnerability, particularly to persuasive and role-play-based attacks (up to 97% JSR). Our adversarial dataset and benchmark suite lay the groundwork for next-generation robust LLM-based evaluators in academic code assessment.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This manuscript has been withdrawn by the authors because the methodology and results have been superseded by a more rigorous framework (SPACI and AST-ASIP).

| **[SWE-Refactor: A Repository-Level Benchmark for Real-World LLM-Based Code Refactoring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03712v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently attracted wide interest for tackling software engineering tasks. In contrast to code generation, refactoring demands precise, semantics-preserving edits that improve program structure, which also makes automated evaluation challenging. However, existing refactoring benchmarks commonly suffer from three shortcomings: limited coverage of refactoring scenarios, the inclusion of instances that mix refactoring with unrelated changes, and insufficient repository-level context for realistic assessment. To mitigate these issues, we introduce SWE-Refactor, a new benchmark for LLM-based code refactoring. SWE-Refactor comprises 1,099 developer-written, behavior-preserving refactorings mined from 18 Java projects, including 922 atomic and 177 compound instances. Each instance is validated via compilation, test execution, and automated refactoring detection tools to ensure correctness. We evaluate nine widely used LLMs on SWE-Refactor, covering models such as GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-V3, and CodeLLaMa, to provide representative reference results. Our results show that complex and compound refactorings remain the primary source of failures; notably, an OpenAI Codex agent achieves only 39.4% success on compound instances. We release SWE-Refactor and all evaluation results to facilitate future research on LLM-based code refactoring.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Commit: Developer Perspectives on Productivity with AI Coding Assistants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03593v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Measuring developer productivity is a topic that has attracted attention from both academic research and industrial practice. In the age of AI coding assistants, it has become even more important for both academia and industry to understand how to measure their impact on developer productivity, and to reconsider whether earlier measures and frameworks still apply. This study analyzes the validity of different approaches to evaluating the productivity impacts of AI coding assistants by leveraging mixed-method research. At BNY Mellon, we conduct a survey with 2989 developer responses and 11 in-depth interviews. Our findings demonstrate that a multifaceted approach is needed to measure AI productivity impacts: survey results expose conflicting perspectives on AI tool usefulness, while interviews elicit six distinct factors that capture both short-term and long-term dimensions of productivity. In contrast to prior work, our factors highlight the importance of long-term metrics like technical expertise and ownership of work. We hope this work encourages future research to incorporate a broader range of human-centered factors, and supports industry in adopting more holistic approaches to evaluating developer productivity.</p></details> | ICSE SEIP |
| **[Causal Inference for the Effect of Code Coverage on Bug Introduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03585v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Code coverage is widely used as a software quality assurance measure. However, its effect, and specifically the advisable dose, are disputed in both the research and engineering communities. Prior work reports only correlational associations, leaving results vulnerable to confounding factors. Objective: We aim to quantify the causal effect of code coverage (exposure) on bug introduction (outcome) in the context of mature JavaScript and TypeScript open source projects, addressing both the overall effect and its variance across coverage levels. Method: We construct a causal directed acyclic graph to identify confounders within the software engineering process, modeling key variables from the source code, issue- and review systems, and continuous integration. Using generalized propensity score adjustment, we will apply doubly robust regression-based causal inference for continuous exposure to a novel dataset of bug-introducing and non-bug-introducing changes. We estimate the average treatment effect and dose-response relationship to examine potential non-linear patterns (e.g., thresholds or diminishing returns) within the projects of our dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Regis...</summary><p>Registered Report with Continuity Acceptance (CA) for submission to Empirical Software Engineering granted by RR-Committee of the MSR'26</p></details> |
| **[Secure Decentralized Pliable Index Coding for Target Data Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03579v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decentralized Pliable Index Coding (DPIC) problem addresses efficient information exchange in distributed systems where clients communicate among themselves without a central server. An important consideration in DPIC is the heterogeneity of side-information and demand sizes. Although many prior works assume homogeneous settings with identical side-information cardinality and single message demands, these assumptions limit real-world applicability where clients typically possess unequal amounts of prior information. In this paper, we study DPIC problem under heterogeneous side-information cardinalities. We propose a transmission scheme that coordinates client broadcasts to maximize coding efficiency while ensuring that each client achieves a common target level $T$. In addition, we impose a strict security constraint that no client acquires more than the target $T$ number of messages, guaranteeing that each client ends up with exactly $T$ messages. We analyze the communication cost incurred by the proposed scheme under this security constraint.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Scaling Test-Driven Code Generation from Functions to Classes: An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03557v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-driven development (TDD) has been adopted to improve Large Language Model (LLM)-based code generation by using tests as executable specifications. However, existing TDD-style code generation studies are largely limited to function-level tasks, leaving class-level synthesis where multiple methods interact through shared state and call dependencies underexplored. In this paper, we scale test-driven code generation from functions to classes via an iterative TDD framework. Our approach first analyzes intra-class method dependencies to derive a feasible generation schedule, and then incrementally implements each method under method-level public tests with reflection-style execution feedback and bounded repair iterations. To support test-driven generation and rigorous class-level evaluation, we construct ClassEval-TDD, a cleaned and standardized variant of ClassEval with consistent specifications, deterministic test environments, and complete method-level public tests. We conduct an empirical study across eight LLMs and compare against the strongest direct-generation baseline (the best of holistic, incremental, and compositional strategies). Our class-level TDD framework consistently improves class-level correctness by 12 to 26 absolute points and achieves up to 71% fully correct classes, while requiring only a small number of repairs on average. These results demonstrate that test-driven generation can effectively scale beyond isolated functions and substantially improve class-level code generation reliability.

| **[Reading Between the Code Lines: On the Use of Self-Admitted Technical Debt for Security Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03470v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static Analysis Tools (SATs) are central to security engineering activities, as they enable early identification of code weaknesses without requiring execution. However, their effectiveness is often limited by high false-positive rates and incomplete coverage of vulnerability classes. At the same time, developers frequently document security-related shortcuts and compromises as Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD) in software artifacts, such as code comments. While prior work has recognized SATD as a rich source of security information, it remains unclear whether -and in what ways- it is utilized during SAT-aided security analysis. OBJECTIVE: This work investigates the extent to which security-related SATD complements the output produced by SATs and helps bridge some of their well-known limitations. METHOD: We followed a mixed-methods approach consisting of (i) the analysis of a SATD-annotated vulnerability dataset using three state-of-the-art SATs and (ii) an online survey with 72 security practitioners. RESULTS: The combined use of all SATs flagged 114 of the 135 security-related SATD instances, spanning 24 distinct Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers. A manual mapping of the SATD comments revealed 33 unique CWE types, 6 of which correspond to categories that SATs commonly overlook or struggle to detect (e.g., race conditions). Survey responses further suggest that developers frequently pair SAT outputs with SATD insights to better understand the impact and root causes of security weaknesses and to identify suitable fixes. IMPLICATIONS: Our findings show that such SATD-encoded information can be a meaningful complement to SAT-driven security analysis, while helping to overcome some of SATs' practical shortcomings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint submitted to Journal of Systems and Software</p></details> |
| **[PRISM: Deriving a White-Box Transformer as a Signal-Noise Decomposition Operator via Maximum Coding Rate Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15540v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning models, particularly Transformers, are often criticized as "black boxes" and lack interpretability. We propose Prism, a white-box attention-based architecture derived from the principles of Maximizing Coding Rate Reduction ($\text{MCR}^2$). By modeling the attention mechanism as a gradient ascent process on a distinct signal-noise manifold, we introduce a specific irrational frequency separation ($π$-RoPE) to enforce incoherence between signal (semantic) and noise (syntactic) subspaces. We show empirical evidence that these geometric inductive biases can induce unsupervised functional disentanglement alone. Prism spontaneously specializes its attention heads into spectrally distinct regimes: low-frequency heads capturing long-range causal dependencies (signal) and high-frequency heads handling local syntactic constraints and structural artifacts. To provide a theoretical grounding for these spectral phenomena, we draw an analogy between attention mechanism and a Hamiltonian dynamical system and identify that the standard geometric progression of Rotary Positional Embeddings (RoPE) induces dense resonance networks (Arnold Tongues), leading to feature rank collapse. Empirical validation on 124M-parameter models trained on OpenWebText demonstrates that Prism spontaneously isolates the Attention Sink pathology and maintains isentropic information flow across layers. Further, we suggest a physics-informed plug-and-play intervention KAM-RoPE for large language models (LLMs). Our results suggest that interpretability and performance can be unified through principled geometric construction, offering a theoretically grounded alternative to heuristic architectural modifications</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Precision in Practice: Knowledge Guided Code Summarizing Grounded in Industrial Expectations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03400v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code summaries are essential for helping developers understand code functionality and reducing maintenance and collaboration costs. Although recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have significantly improved automatic code summarization, the practical usefulness of generated summaries in industrial settings remains insufficiently explored. In collaboration with documentation experts from the industrial HarmonyOS project, we conducted a questionnaire study showing that over 57.4% of code summaries produced by state-of-the-art approaches were rejected due to violations of developers' expectations for industrial documentation. Beyond semantic similarity to reference summaries, developers emphasize additional requirements, including the use of appropriate domain terminology, explicit function categorization, and the avoidance of redundant implementation details. To address these expectations, we propose ExpSum, an expectation-aware code summarization approach that integrates function metadata abstraction, informative metadata filtering, context-aware domain knowledge retrieval, and constraint-driven prompting to guide LLMs in generating structured, expectation-aligned summaries. We evaluate ExpSum on the HarmonyOS project and widely used code summarization benchmarks. Experimental results show that ExpSum consistently outperforms all baselines, achieving improvements of up to 26.71% in BLEU-4 and 20.10% in ROUGE-L on HarmonyOS. Furthermore, LLM-based evaluations indicate that ExpSum-generated summaries better align with developer expectations across other projects, demonstrating its effectiveness for industrial code documentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Quantity: Trajectory Diversity Scaling for Code Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03219v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As code large language models (LLMs) evolve into tool-interactive agents via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), their generalization is increasingly limited by low-quality synthetic data and the diminishing returns of quantity scaling. Moreover, quantity-centric scaling exhibits an early bottleneck that underutilizes trajectory data. We propose TDScaling, a Trajectory Diversity Scaling-based data synthesis framework for code agents that scales performance through diversity rather than raw volume. Under a fixed training budget, increasing trajectory diversity yields larger gains than adding more trajectories, improving the performance-cost trade-off for agent training. TDScaling integrates four innovations: (1) a Business Cluster mechanism that captures real-service logical dependencies; (2) a blueprint-driven multi-agent paradigm that enforces trajectory coherence; (3) an adaptive evolution mechanism that steers synthesis toward long-tail scenarios using Domain Entropy, Reasoning Mode Entropy, and Cumulative Action Complexity to prevent mode collapse; and (4) a sandboxed code tool that mitigates catastrophic forgetting of intrinsic coding capabilities. Experiments on general tool-use benchmarks (BFCL, tau^2-Bench) and code agent tasks (RebenchT, CodeCI, BIRD) demonstrate a win-win outcome: TDScaling improves both tool-use generalization and inherent coding proficiency. We plan to release the full codebase and the synthesized dataset (including 30,000+ tool clusters) upon publication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Confucius Code Agent: Scalable Agent Scaffolding for Real-World Codebases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10398v6)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world software engineering tasks require coding agents that can operate on massive repositories, sustain long-horizon sessions, and reliably coordinate complex toolchains at test time. Existing research-grade coding agents offer transparency but struggle when scaled to heavier, production-level workloads, while production-grade systems achieve strong practical performance but provide limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We introduce the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), a software engineering agent that can operate at large-scale codebases. CCA is built on top of the Confucius SDK, an agent development platform structured around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK supports a unified orchestrator with advanced context management for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension system for reliable tool use. In addition, we introduce a meta-agent that automates the construction, evaluation, and refinement of agents through a build-test-improve cycle, enabling rapid agent development on new tasks and tool stacks. Instantiated on the Confucius SDK using the meta-agent, CCA demonstrates strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA achieves a Resolve@1 of 59%, exceeding prior research baselines as well as commercial results, under identical repositories, model backends, and tool access.</p></details> | The latest version |
| **[Straggler-Aware Coded Polynomial Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03074v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coded polynomial aggregation (CPA) in distributed computing systems enables the master to directly recover a weighted aggregation of polynomial computations without individually decoding each term, thereby reducing the number of required worker responses. However, existing CPA schemes are restricted to an idealized setting in which the system cannot tolerate stragglers. In this paper, we extend CPA to straggler-aware distributed computing systems with a pre-specified non-straggler pattern, where exact recovery is required for a given collection of admissible non-straggler sets. Our main results show that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than that required by polynomial codes based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA. We identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery. When the number of admissible non-straggler sets is sufficiently large, we further show that this threshold is necessary in a generic sense. We also provide an explicit construction of feasible CPA schemes whenever the intersection size exceeds the derived threshold. Finally, simulations verify our theoretical results by demonstrating a sharp feasibility transition at the predicted intersection threshold.</p></details> | 6 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Fundamental Limits of Coded Polynomial Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10028v2)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coded polynomial aggregation (CPA) enables the master to directly recover a weighted aggregation of polynomial evaluations without individually decoding each term, thereby reducing the number of required worker responses. In this paper, we extend CPA to straggler-aware distributed computing systems and introduce a straggler-aware CPA framework with pre-specified non-straggler patterns, where exact recovery is required only for a given collection of admissible non-straggler sets. Our main result shows that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than required by polynomial coded computing based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is fundamentally characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA and identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery. We further prove that this threshold becomes both necessary and sufficient when the number of admissible non-straggler sets is sufficiently large. We also provide an explicit construction of feasible CPA schemes whenever the intersection size exceeds the derived threshold. Finally, simulations reveal a sharp feasibility transition at the predicted threshold, providing empirical evidence that the bound is tight in practice.</p></details> | 7 pages, 1 figure |
| **[CVE-Factory: Scaling Expert-Level Agentic Tasks for Code Security Vulnerability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03012v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating and improving the security capabilities of code agents requires high-quality, executable vulnerability tasks. However, existing works rely on costly, unscalable manual reproduction and suffer from outdated data distributions. To address these, we present CVE-Factory, the first multi-agent framework to achieve expert-level quality in automatically transforming sparse CVE metadata into fully executable agentic tasks. Cross-validation against human expert reproductions shows that CVE-Factory achieves 95\% solution correctness and 96\% environment fidelity, confirming its expert-level quality. It is also evaluated on the latest realistic vulnerabilities and achieves a 66.2\% verified success. This automation enables two downstream contributions. First, we construct LiveCVEBench, a continuously updated benchmark of 190 tasks spanning 14 languages and 153 repositories that captures emerging threats including AI-tooling vulnerabilities. Second, we synthesize over 1,000 executable training environments, the first large-scale scaling of agentic tasks in code security. Fine-tuned Qwen3-32B improves from 5.3\% to 35.8\% on LiveCVEBench, surpassing Claude 4.5 Sonnet, with gains generalizing to Terminal Bench (12.5\% to 31.3\%). We open-source CVE-Factory, LiveCVEBench, Abacus-cve (fine-tuned model), training dataset, and leaderboard.

However, even advanced prompting workflows like progressive prompting often leave some requirements unmet. Although methods such as self-critique, multi-model collaboration, and retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) have been proposed to address these gaps, developers lack clear guidance on when to use each. In an empirical study of 25 GitHub projects, we found that progressive prompting achieves 96.9% average task completion, significantly outperforming direct prompting (80.5%, Cohen's d=1.63, p<0.001) but still leaving 8 projects incomplete. For 6 of the most representative projects, we evaluated each enhancement strategy across 4 failure types. Our results reveal that method effectiveness depends critically on failure characteristics: Self-Critique succeeds on code-reviewable logic errors but fails completely on external service integration (0% improvement), while RAG achieves highest completion across all failure types with superior efficiency. Based on these findings, we propose a decision framework that maps each failure pattern to the most suitable enhancement method, giving practitioners practical, data-driven guidance instead of trial-and-error.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at SANER 2026</p></details> |
| **[Co-Designing Quantum Codes with Transversal Diagonal Gates via Multi-Agent Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20728v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a multi-agent, human-in-the-loop workflow that co-designs quantum error-correcting codes with prescribed transversal diagonal gates. It builds on the Subset-Sum Linear Programming (SSLP) framework, which partitions basis strings by modular residues and enforces Z-marginal Knill-Laflamme (KL) equalities via small LPs. The workflow is powered by GPT-5 and implemented within TeXRA, a multi-agent research assistant platform where agents collaborate in a shared LaTeX-Python workspace synchronized with Git/Overleaf. Three specialized agents formulate constraints, sweep and screen candidate codes, exactify numerical solutions into rationals, and independently audit all KL equalities and induced logical actions. Focusing on distance-two codes with nondegenerate residues, we catalogue new nonadditive codes for dimensions $K\in\{2,3,4\}$ on up to six qubits, including high-order diagonal transversals, yielding $14,116$ new codes. From these data, the system abstracts closed-form families and constructs a residue-degenerate $((6,4,2))$ code implementing a transversal controlled-phase $\mathrm{diag}(1,1,1,i)$, illustrating how AI orchestration can drive rigorous, scalable code discovery.</p></details> | 63 pages, 3 figures |
| **[ATLAS: Automated Toolkit for Large-Scale Verified Code Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10173v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have become proficient at generating functional code, but ensuring the output truly matches the programmer's intent remains difficult. Testing improves trust, yet for safety-critical applications, formal verification provides the only true guarantees through machine-checked proofs. However, verified code remains scarce compared to mainstream languages or mathematical theorem proving, limiting LLM capabilities in this domain. We present ATLAS, an automated pipeline that synthesizes verified programs to address this data bottleneck. Applied to the TACO dataset of Python solutions to LeetCode-style problems, ATLAS generates 2.7K verified Dafny programs, each with high-quality specifications and machine-checked proofs. Through task decomposition, we extract 19K training examples. Fine-tuning Qwen 2.5 7B Coder on this data improves performance from 32.4% to 56.9% on DafnyBench and from 15.8% to 65.8% on DafnySynthesis, demonstrating that synthetic data generation is a viable path to scaling LLM capabilities for formal verification.</p></details> |  |
| **[CAM: A Causality-based Analysis Framework for Multi-Agent Code Generation Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02138v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the remarkable success that Multi-Agent Code Generation Systems (MACGS) have achieved, the inherent complexity of multi-agent architectures produces substantial volumes of intermediate outputs. To date, the individual importance of these intermediate outputs to the system correctness remains opaque, which impedes targeted optimization of MACGS designs. To address this challenge, we propose CAM, the first \textbf{C}ausality-based \textbf{A}nalysis framework for \textbf{M}ACGS that systematically quantifies the contribution of different intermediate features for system correctness. By comprehensively categorizing intermediate outputs and systematically simulating realistic errors on intermediate features, we identify the important features for system correctness and aggregate their importance rankings. We conduct extensive empirical analysis on the identified importance rankings. Our analysis reveals intriguing findings: first, we uncover context-dependent features\textemdash features whose importance emerges mainly through interactions with other features, revealing that quality assurance for MACGS should incorporate cross-feature consistency checks; second, we reveal that hybrid backend MACGS with different backend LLMs assigned according to their relative strength achieves up to 7.2\% Pass@1 improvement, underscoring hybrid architectures as a promising direction for future MACGS design. We further demonstrate CAM's practical utility through two applications: (1) failure repair which achieves a 73.3\% success rate by optimizing top-3 importance-ranked features and (2) feature pruning that reduces up to 66.8\% intermediate token consumption while maintaining generation performance. Our work provides actionable insights for MACGS design and deployment, establishing causality analysis as a powerful approach for understanding and improving MACGS.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 12 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Two-Stage Coded-Sliding Beam Training and QoS-Constrained Sum-Rate Maximization for SIM-Assisted Wireless Communications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02131v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stacked intelligent metasurfaces (SIM) provide a cost-effective and scalable solution for large-scale antenna communications.However, efficient channel state information acquisition and phase shift optimization remain critical challenges. In this paper, we develop a unified framework of low-complexity algorithms for SIM-assisted communication systems to address these issues. Specifically, we propose a generalized two-step codebook construction (TSCC) method that leverages two-dimensional angular-domain decoupling to transform planar array beamformer design into two independent one-dimensional linear array beamformer design problems, efficiently solved via the Gerchberg-Saxton algorithm and our proposed majorization-minimization-based proximal distance (PDMM) algorithm. We further develop a two-stage coded-sliding beam training (TSCSBT) method for low-overhead and high-accuracy beam training, where error-correcting codes are embedded in the first-stage training to enhance robustness against noise, and sliding sampling is subsequently performed around the matched angular samples to improve angular resolution. The proposed framework is further extended to multi-path user channels. Finally, a variable decoupling-based block successive upper bound minimization (VD-BSUM) algorithm is proposed to directly solve the QoS-constrained sum-rate maximization problem through closed-form iterative updates with substantially reduced computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methods in achieving precise beam pattern realization, improved beam training accuracy and angular resolution, and enhanced sum-rate performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Programming Language Confusion: When Code LLMs Can't Keep their Languages Straight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13620v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance across software engineering tasks, from code generation to translation. However, we identify and systematically evaluate a critical failure mode: Programming Language Confusion (PLC) -- the generation of code in unintended languages despite explicit instructions. Through evaluation of 10 popular LLMs across six multilingual datasets (LiveCodeBench, BabelCode variants, HumanEval-XL, and McEval), we demonstrate that PLC is pervasive, with some specialized models exhibiting the highest confusion rates. Our analysis reveals that PLC is not random noise but reflects systematic patterns: models consistently generate syntactically valid code even when it deviates from language specifications. This behavior produces distinct language migration patterns, most notably a strong default to Python and systematic shifts between syntactically similar language pairs (e.g., C#/Java). These migrations reflect statistical preferences learned from training data rather than goal-directed reasoning. We demonstrate that explicit language keywords provide the most effective mitigation, while natural language instructions have limited influence on model behavior. Furthermore, model quantization -- though essential for practical deployment -- significantly amplifies PLC and degrades syntactic stability in complex tasks. Our findings underscore that language fidelity should be treated as a core evaluation dimension for code LLMs. We advocate for standardized benchmarks and prompt formats with explicit language constraints to enable more reliable assessment and foster the development of robust, multilingual code generation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at SANER 2026</p></details> |

While detecting AI-generated code is critical, existing datasets and benchmarks are narrow, typically limited to binary human-machine classification under in-distribution settings. To bridge this gap, we introduce $\emph{AICD Bench}$, the most comprehensive benchmark for AI-generated code detection. It spans $\emph{2M examples}$, $\emph{77 models}$ across $\emph{11 families}$, and $\emph{9 programming languages}$, including recent reasoning models. Beyond scale, AICD Bench introduces three realistic detection tasks: ($\emph{i}$)~$\emph{Robust Binary Classification}$ under distribution shifts in language and domain, ($\emph{ii}$)~$\emph{Model Family Attribution}$, grouping generators by architectural lineage, and ($\emph{iii}$)~$\emph{Fine-Grained Human-Machine Classification}$ across human, machine, hybrid, and adversarial code. Extensive evaluation on neural and classical detectors shows that performance remains far below practical usability, particularly under distribution shift and for hybrid or adversarial code. We release AICD Bench as a $\emph{unified, challenging evaluation suite}$ to drive the next generation of robust approaches for AI-generated code detection. The data and the code are available at https://huggingface.co/AICD-bench}.</p></details> |  |

Textures of clouds and waves, the growth of cities and forests, or the formation of materials and landscapes are all examples of patterns emerging from underlying mechanisms. We present the SciTextures dataset, a large-scale collection of textures and visual patterns from all domains of science, tech, and art, along with the models and code that generate these images. Covering over 1,270 different models and 100,000 images of patterns and textures from physics, chemistry, biology, sociology, technology, mathematics, and art, this dataset offers a way to explore the deep connection between the visual patterns that shape our world and the mechanisms that produce them. Built through an agentic AI pipeline that autonomously collects, implements, and standardizes scientific and generative models. This AI pipeline is also used to autonomously invent and implement novel methods for generating visual patterns and textures. SciTextures enables systematic evaluation of vision language models (VLM's) ability to link visual patterns to the models and code that generate them, and to identify different patterns that emerge from the same underlying process. We also test VLMs ability to infer and recreate the mechanisms behind visual patterns by providing a natural image of a real-world phenomenon and asking the AI to identify and code a model of the process that formed it, then run this code to generate a simulated image that is compared to the reference image. These benchmarks reveal that VLM's can understand and simulate physical systems beyond visual patterns at multiple levels of abstraction.

However, recent red-teaming work has focused on incremental gains in attack success over identifying underlying architectural vulnerabilities in models. In this work, we present \textbf{CMP-RT}, a novel red-teaming probe that combines code-mixing with phonetic perturbations (CMP), exposing a tokenizer-level safety vulnerability in transformers. Combining realistic elements from digital communication such as code-mixing and textese, CMP-RT preserves phonetics while perturbing safety-critical tokens, allowing harmful prompts to bypass alignment mechanisms while maintaining high prompt interpretability, exposing a gap between pre-training and safety alignment. Our results demonstrate robustness against standard defenses, attack scalability, and generalization of the vulnerability across modalities and to SOTA models like Gemini-3-Pro, establishing CMP-RT as a major threat model and highlighting tokenization as an under-examined vulnerability in current safety pipelines.</p></details> |  |

We probe this phenomenon using Baba Is You, where physical laws are mutable text rules, enabling precise evaluation of models' ability to override learned priors when rules change. We quantatively observe that larger models can exhibit inverse scaling: they perform worse than smaller models when natural language reasoning requires suppressing pre-trained associations (e.g., accepting "Lava is Safe"). Our analysis attributes this to natural language encoding, which entangles descriptive semantics and logical rules, leading to persistent hallucinations of familiar physics despite explicit contradictory rules. Here we show that representing dynamics as executable code, rather than descriptive text, reverses this trend and enables effective prior inhibition. We introduce Code-Grounded Vistas (LCV), which fine-tunes models on counterfactual pairs and identifies states with contradictory rules, thereby forcing attention to logical constraints rather than visual semantics. This training-time approach outperforms expensive inference-time search methods in both efficiency and accuracy. Our results demonstrate that representation fundamentally determines whether scaling improves or impairs contextual reasoning. This challenges the assumption that larger models are universally better, with implications for domains that require dynamic overriding of learned priors.</p></details> |  |

However, in practice, PC is predominantly digitally simulated, requiring excessive amounts of compute while struggling to scale to deeper architectures. This paper reformulates PC to overcome this hardware-algorithm mismatch. First, we uncover how the canonical state-based formulation of PC (sPC) is, by design, deeply inefficient in digital simulation, inevitably resulting in exponential signal decay that stalls the entire minimization process. Then, to overcome this fundamental limitation, we introduce error-based PC (ePC), a novel reparameterization of PC which does not suffer from signal decay. Though no longer biologically plausible, ePC numerically computes exact PC weights gradients and runs orders of magnitude faster than sPC. Experiments across multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate that ePC matches backpropagation's performance even for deeper models where sPC struggles. Besides practical improvements, our work provides theoretical insight into PC dynamics and establishes a foundation for scaling PC-based learning to deeper architectures on digital hardware and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>Title...</summary><p>Title & intro change to emphasize PC's hardware-algorithm mismatch, which ePC solves for digital hardware.

This paper introduces ``Vibe Coding,'' a pedagogical approach that leverages LLMs as coding assistants while maintaining focus on conceptual understanding and critical thinking. We describe the implementation of this approach in a senior-level undergraduate NLP course, where students completed seven labs using LLMs for code generation while being assessed primarily on conceptual understanding through critical reflection questions. Analysis of end-of-course feedback from 19 students reveals high satisfaction (mean scores 4.4-4.6/5.0) across engagement, conceptual learning, and assessment fairness. Students particularly valued the reduced cognitive load from debugging, enabling deeper focus on NLP concepts. However, challenges emerged around time constraints, LLM output verification, and the need for clearer task specifications. Our findings suggest that when properly structured with mandatory prompt logging and reflection-based assessment, LLM-assisted learning can shift focus from syntactic fluency to conceptual mastery, preparing students for an AI-augmented professional landscape.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in The Seventh Workshop on Teaching Natural Language Processing (Teaching NLP @ EACL2026)</p></details> |
| **[CodeOCR: On the Effectiveness of Vision Language Models in Code Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.01785v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in source code understanding, yet as software systems grow in scale, computational efficiency has become a critical bottleneck. Currently, these models rely on a text-based paradigm that treats source code as a linear sequence of tokens, which leads to a linear increase in context length and associated computational costs. The rapid advancement of Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) introduces an opportunity to optimize efficiency by representing source code as rendered images. Unlike text, which is difficult to compress without losing semantic meaning, the image modality is inherently suitable for compression. By adjusting resolution, images can be scaled to a fraction of their original token cost while remaining recognizable to vision-capable models. To explore the feasibility of this approach, we conduct the first systematic study on the effectiveness of MLLMs for code understanding. Our experiments reveal that: (1) MLLMs can effectively understand code with substantial token reduction, achieving up to 8x compression; (2) MLLMs can effectively leverage visual cues such as syntax highlighting, improving code completion performance under 4x compression; and (3) Code-understanding tasks like clone detection exhibit exceptional resilience to visual compression, with some compression ratios even slightly outperforming raw text inputs. Our findings highlight both the potential and current limitations of MLLMs in code understanding, which points out a shift toward image-modality code representation as a pathway to more efficient inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data are available at https://github.com/YerbaPage/CodeOCR</p></details> |

However, the computational costs associated with LLM inference, particularly in terms of latency and energy consumption, have received limited attention in the security context. This paper introduces DrainCode, the first adversarial attack targeting the computational efficiency of RAG-based code generation systems. By strategically poisoning retrieval contexts through a mutation-based approach, DrainCode forces LLMs to produce significantly longer outputs, thereby increasing GPU latency and energy consumption. We evaluate the effectiveness of DrainCode across multiple models. Our experiments show that DrainCode achieves up to an 85% increase in latency, a 49% increase in energy consumption, and more than a 3x increase in output length compared to the baseline. Furthermore, we demonstrate the generalizability of the attack across different prompting strategies and its effectiveness compared to different defenses. The results highlight DrainCode as a potential method for increasing the computational overhead of LLMs, making it useful for evaluating LLM security in resource-constrained environments. We provide code and data at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/DrainCode.</p></details> | 16 pages, 4 figures |

Tools such as Cursor and Claude Code have popularized "vibe coding" (where developers steer development through high-level intent), commonly relying on context engineering and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to ground generation in a codebase. However, these paradigms struggle in ultra-complex enterprise systems, where software evolves incrementally under pervasive design constraints and depends on tacit knowledge such as responsibilities, intent, and decision rationales distributed across code, configurations, discussions, and version history. In this environment, context engineering faces a fundamental barrier: the required context is scattered across artifacts and entangled across time, beyond the capacity of LLMs to reliably capture, prioritize, and fuse evidence into correct and trustworthy decisions, even as context windows grow. To bridge this gap, we propose the Code Digital Twin, a persistent and evolving knowledge infrastructure built on the codebase. It separates long-term knowledge engineering from task-time context engineering and serves as a backend "context engine" for AI coding assistants. The Code Digital Twin models both the physical and conceptual layers of software and co-evolves with the system. By integrating hybrid knowledge representations, multi-stage extraction pipelines, incremental updates, AI-empowered applications, and human-in-the-loop feedback, it transforms fragmented knowledge into explicit and actionable representations, providing a roadmap toward sustainable and resilient development and evolution of ultra-complex systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>A vis...</summary><p>A vision paper that will be continuously updated</p></details> |

By invoking Forney's cubing construction of Golay codes and their generators $G^*(8,7)/(8,4)$, we found different construction methods of Golay codes from PAC codes, which result in an efficient parallel list decoding algorithm with near-maximum likelihood performance. Compared with existing methods, our method can get rid of index permutation and codeword puncturing. Using the new decoding method, some related lattices, such as Leech lattice $Λ_{24}$ and its principal sublattice $H_{24}$, can be also decoded efficiently.</p></details> |  |

We introduce ProjDevBench, an end-to-end benchmark that provides project requirements to coding agents and evaluates the resulting repositories. Combining Online Judge (OJ) testing with LLM-assisted code review, the benchmark evaluates agents on (1) system architecture design, (2) functional correctness, and (3) iterative solution refinement. We curate 20 programming problems across 8 categories, covering both concept-oriented tasks and real-world application scenarios, and evaluate six coding agents built on different LLM backends. Our evaluation reports an overall acceptance rate of 27.38%: agents handle basic functionality and data structures but struggle with complex system design, time complexity optimization, and resource management.

Recent work has introduced multi-precision models, which enable inference at multiple precisions within a single model depending on runtime constraints. To support such flexibility, quantized weights are often stored as bit-planes, where hardware efficiency improves when the compute operates directly at the bit-plane level and activates only the precision required by each request. In this work, we present AnyBCQ, a hardware-friendly multi-precision extension of Binary-Coded Quantization (BCQ) that supports direct bit-plane operations. By representing weights as binary bit-planes with corresponding scale factors, AnyBCQ enables bit-plane-level computation and maps naturally to accelerator-friendly, bit-parallel arithmetic. Our progressive precision expansion mechanism incrementally refines scaling factors while reusing previously assigned binary codes, yielding monotonic improvements in accuracy as additional bits are enabled. We further co-design a specialized kernel that exploits the BCQ structure to support dynamic per-request precision selection with negligible overhead. Experiments on recent LLMs demonstrate that AnyBCQ significantly narrows the accuracy drop in the low-bit regime (e.g. 2-bit), remains competitive at higher precision, and achieves throughput gains of up to 3.0x over half precision and 1.2x over state-of-the-art multi-precision methods. By aligning algorithmic flexibility with hardware efficiency, AnyBCQ provides a practical foundation for multi-precision LLM deployment across diverse service-level objectives.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |

Despite this flexibility, the high computational complexity and large parameter footprint of transformer-based decoders present substantial obstacles to practical deployment. To address these challenges, we investigate structured pruning for FECCT and propose Spectral-Aligned Pruning (SAP), a structure-aware framework that enables cross-code reuse of structured pruning masks across codes by leveraging the spectrum of the corresponding bipartite graph. After pruning, SAP performs per-code recovery via parameter-efficient low-rank adaptation (LoRA), enabling a shared pruned backbone while storing only small code-specific adapter parameters. Experiments across diverse codes show that SAP achieves decoding performance comparable to dedicated per-code pruning, while enabling substantial reductions in computational cost and model memory footprint through kernel-level structured pruning.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches face a critical trade-off: text-based WMs sacrifice visual fidelity, while the inability of visual WMs in precise text rendering led to their reliance on slow, complex pipelines dependent on numerous external models. We propose a novel paradigm: visual world modeling via renderable code generation, where a single Vision-Language Model (VLM) predicts the next GUI state as executable web code that renders to pixels, rather than generating pixels directly. This combines the strengths of both approaches: VLMs retain their linguistic priors for precise text rendering while their pre-training on structured web code enables high-fidelity visual generation. We introduce gWorld (8B, 32B), the first open-weight visual mobile GUI WMs built on this paradigm, along with a data generation framework (gWorld) that automatically synthesizes code-based training data. In extensive evaluation across 4 in- and 2 out-of-distribution benchmarks, gWorld sets a new pareto frontier in accuracy versus model size, outperforming 8 frontier open-weight models over 50.25x larger. Further analyses show that (1) scaling training data via gWorld yields meaningful gains, (2) each component of our pipeline improves data quality, and (3) stronger world modeling improves downstream mobile GUI policy performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print (technical report)</p></details> |

By leveraging a Boolean approximation-based analysis--Diversity Evolution (DivE)--we derive structural constraints for generalized rootchecks that guarantee full diversity. Based on these constraints, we propose a protograph template tailored for two-block BFCs. Furthermore, we employ a genetic algorithm guided by density evolution to optimize the protograph edges within this template for superior AWGNC performance. The resulting codes effectively bridge the gap between diversityoriented and capacity-oriented designs, exhibiting robust performance across both channel environments.</p></details> | Preprint |

Current approaches typically employ a control-centric paradigm, forcing agents to navigate complex directory structures and irrelevant control logic. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift from the standard Code Property Graphs (CPGs) to the concept of Data Transformation Graph (DTG) that inverts the topology by modeling data states as nodes and functions as edges, enabling agents to trace logic defects through data lineage rather than control flow. We introduce a multi-agent framework that reconciles data integrity navigation with control flow logic. Our theoretical analysis and case studies demonstrate that this approach resolves the "Semantic Trap" inherent in standard RAG systems in modern coding agents. We provide a comprehensive implementation in the form of Autonomous Issue Resolver (AIR), a self-improvement system for zero-touch code maintenance that utilizes neuro-symbolic reasoning and uses the DTG structure for scalable logic repair. Our approach has demonstrated good results on several SWE benchmarks, reaching a resolution rate of 87.1% on SWE-Verified benchmark. Our approach directly addresses the core limitations of current AI code-assistant tools and tackles the critical need for a more robust foundation for our increasingly software-dependent world.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |

Despite plausible codes generated by LLMs, producing solutions that meet the stringent correctness and performance requirements of systems demands iterative optimization. Test-time reinforcement learning offers high search efficiency but requires parameter updates infeasible under API-only access, while existing training-free evolutionary methods suffer from inefficient context utilization and undirected search. We introduce ContextEvolve, a multi-agent framework that achieves RL-level search efficiency under strict parameter-blind constraints by decomposing optimization context into three orthogonal dimensions: a Summarizer Agent condenses semantic state via code-to-language abstraction, a Navigator Agent distills optimization direction from trajectory analysis, and a Sampler Agent curates experience distribution through prioritized exemplar retrieval. This orchestration forms a functional isomorphism with RL-mapping to state representation, policy gradient, and experience replay-enabling principled optimization in a textual latent space. On the ADRS benchmark, ContextEvolve outperforms state-of-the-art baselines by 33.3% while reducing token consumption by 29.0%.

However, their practical utility is blocked by a critical limitation: the requirement of a fixed-length masked sequence for generation. This constraint severely degrades code infilling performance when the predefined mask size mismatches the ideal completion length. To address this, we propose DreamOn, a novel diffusion framework that enables dynamic, variable-length generation. DreamOn augments the diffusion process with two length control states, allowing the model to autonomously expand or contract the output length based solely on its own predictions. We integrate this mechanism into existing DLMs with minimal modifications to the training objective and no architectural changes. Built upon Dream-Coder-7B and DiffuCoder-7B, DreamOn achieves infilling performance on par with state-of-the-art autoregressive models on HumanEval-Infilling and SantaCoder-FIM and matches oracle performance achieved with ground-truth length. Our work removes a fundamental barrier to the practical deployment of DLMs, significantly advancing their flexibility and applicability for variable-length generation.

This formulation contrasts to the cognitive process of programming, which is inherently interleaved with forward generation and on-the-fly revision. While prior works attempt to introduce revision via post-hoc agents or external static tools, they either suffer from high latency or fail to leverage the model's intrinsic semantic reasoning. In this paper, we propose Stream of Revision, a paradigm shift that elevates code generation from a monotonic stream to a dynamic, self-correcting trajectory by leveraging model's intrinsic capabilities. We introduce specific action tokens that enable the model to seamlessly backtrack and edit its own history within a single forward pass. By internalizing the revision loop, our framework Stream of Revision allows the model to activate its latent capabilities just-in-time without external dependencies. Empirical results on secure code generation show that Stream of Revision significantly reduces vulnerabilities with minimal inference overhead.</p></details> |  |

A reverse-complement duplication of length $k$ is the insertion of the reversed and complemented copy of a substring of length $k$ adjacent to its original position, while a palindromic duplication only inserts the reversed copy without complementation. We first construct an explicit code with a single redundant symbol capable of correcting an arbitrary number of reverse-complement duplications (respectively, palindromic duplications), provided that all duplications have length $k \ge 3\lceil \log_q n \rceil$ and are disjoint. Next, we derive a Gilbert-Varshamov bound for codes that can correct a reverse-complement duplication (respectively, palindromic duplication) of arbitrary length, showing that the optimal redundancy is upper bounded by $2\log_q n + \log_q\log_q n + O(1)$. Finally, for $q \ge 4$, we present two explicit constructions of codes that can correct $t$ length-one reverse-complement duplications. The first construction achieves a redundancy of $2t\log_q n + O(\log_q\log_q n)$ with encoding complexity $O(n)$ and decoding complexity $O\big(n(\log_2 n)^4\big)$. The second construction achieves an improved redundancy of $(2t-1)\log_q n + O(\log_q\log_q n)$, but with encoding and decoding complexities of $O\big(n \cdot \mathrm{poly}(\log_2 n)\big)$.</p></details> |  |

To address this, we conduct a comprehensive error analysis, finding that most failures arise not from deficient reasoning, but from a lack of RTL programming knowledge, insufficient circuit understanding, ambiguous specifications, or misinterpreted multimodal inputs. Leveraging in-context learning, we propose targeted correction techniques: a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) knowledge base to supply domain expertise; design description rules with rule-checking to clarify inputs; external tools to convert multimodal data into LLM-compatible formats; and an iterative simulation-debugging loop for remaining errors. Integrating these into an LLM-based framework yields significant improvement, achieving 98.1% accuracy on the VerilogEval benchmark with DeepSeek-v3.2-Speciale, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Computer-Aided Design of Integrated Circuits and Systems</p></details> |

We present Constitutional Spec-Driven Development, a methodology that embeds non-negotiable security principles into the specification layer, ensuring AI-generated code adheres to security requirements by construction rather than inspection. Our approach introduces a Constitution: a versioned, machine-readable document encoding security constraints derived from Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE)/MITRE Top 25 vulnerabilities and regulatory frameworks. We demonstrate the methodology through a banking microservices application, selected as a representative example domain due to its stringent regulatory and security requirements, implementing customer management, account operations, and transaction processing. The methodology itself is domain-agnostic. The implementation addresses 10 critical CWE vulnerabilities through constitutional constraints with full traceability from principles to code locations.

| **[Code Quality Analysis of Translations from C to Rust](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00840v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>C/C++ is a prevalent programming language. Yet, it suffers from significant memory and thread-safety issues. Recent studies have explored automated translation of C/C++ to safer languages, such as Rust. However, these studies focused mostly on the correctness and safety of the translated code, which are indeed critical, but they left other important quality concerns (e.g., performance, robustness, and maintainability) largely unexplored. This work investigates strengths and weaknesses of three C-to-Rust translators, namely C2Rust (a transpiler), C2SaferRust (an LLM-guided transpiler), and TranslationGym (an LLM-based direct translation). We perform an in-depth quantitative and qualitative analysis of several important quality attributes for the translated Rust code of the popular GNU coreutils, using human-based translation as a baseline. To assess the internal and external quality of the Rust code, we: (i) apply Clippy, a rule-based state-of-the-practice Rust static analysis tool; (ii) investigate the capability of an LLM (GPT-4o) to identify issues potentially overlooked by Clippy; and (iii) perform a manual analysis of the issues reported by Clippy and GPT-4o. Our results show that while newer techniques reduce some unsafe and non-idiomatic patterns, they frequently introduce new issues, revealing systematic trade-offs that are not visible under existing evaluation practices. Notably, none of the automated techniques consistently match or exceed human-written translations across all quality dimensions, yet even human-written Rust code exhibits persistent internal quality issues such as readability and non-idiomatic patterns. Together, these findings show that translation quality remains a multi-dimensional challenge, requiring systematic evaluation and targeted tool support beyond both naive automation and manual rewriting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Vision-Language Models Handle Long-Context Code? An Empirical Study on Visual Compression](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00746v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with long-context code due to window limitations. Existing textual code compression methods mitigate this via selective filtering but often disrupt dependency closure, causing semantic fragmentation. To address this, we introduce LongCodeOCR, a visual compression framework that renders code into compressed two-dimensional image sequences for Vision-Language Models (VLMs). By preserving a global view, this approach avoids the dependency breakage inherent in filtering. We systematically evaluate LongCodeOCR against the state-of-the-art LongCodeZip across four benchmarks spanning code summarization, code question answering, and code completion. Our results demonstrate that visual code compression serves as a viable alternative for tasks requiring global understanding. At comparable compression ratios ($\sim$1.7$\times$), LongCodeOCR improves CompScore on Long Module Summarization by 36.85 points over LongCodeZip. At a 1M-token context length with Glyph (a specialized 9B VLM), LongCodeOCR maintains higher accuracy than LongCodeZip while operating at about 4$\times$ higher compression. Moreover, compared with LongCodeZip, LongCodeOCR drastically reduces compression-stage overhead (reducing latency from $\sim$4.3 hours to $\sim$1 minute at 1M tokens). Finally, our results characterize a fundamental coverage--fidelity trade-off: visual code compression retains broader context coverage to support global dependencies, yet faces fidelity bottlenecks on exactness-critical tasks; by contrast, textual code compression preserves symbol-level precision while sacrificing structural coverage.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Detection to Prevention: Explaining Security-Critical Code to Avoid Vulnerabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00711v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Security vulnerabilities often arise unintentionally during development due to a lack of security expertise and code complexity. Traditional tools, such as static and dynamic analysis, detect vulnerabilities only after they are introduced in code, leading to costly remediation. This work explores a proactive strategy to prevent vulnerabilities by highlighting code regions that implement security-critical functionality -- such as data access, authentication, and input handling -- and providing guidance for their secure implementation. We present an IntelliJ IDEA plugin prototype that uses code-level software metrics to identify potentially security-critical methods and large language models (LLMs) to generate prevention-oriented explanations. Our initial evaluation on the Spring-PetClinic application shows that the selected metrics identify most known security-critical methods, while an LLM provides actionable, prevention-focused insights. Although these metrics capture structural properties rather than semantic aspects of security, this work lays the foundation for code-level security-aware metrics and enhanced explanations.</p></details> | 4 pages |
| **[Malicious Code Detection in Smart Contracts via Opcode Vectorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12720v2)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the booming development of blockchain technology, smart contracts have been widely used in finance, supply chain, Internet of things and other fields in recent years. However, the security problems of smart contracts become increasingly prominent. Security events caused by smart contracts occur frequently, and the existence of malicious codes may lead to the loss of user assets and system crash. In this paper, a simple study is carried out on malicious code detection of intelligent contracts based on machine learning. The main research work and achievements are as follows: Feature extraction and vectorization of smart contract are the first step to detect malicious code of smart contract by using machine learning method, and feature processing has an important impact on detection results. In this paper, an opcode vectorization method based on smart contract text is adopted. Based on considering the structural characteristics of contract opcodes, the opcodes are classified and simplified. Then, N-Gram (N=2) algorithm and TF-IDF algorithm are used to convert the simplified opcodes into vectors, and then put into the machine learning model for training. In contrast, N-Gram algorithm and TF-IDF algorithm are directly used to quantify opcodes and put into the machine learning model training. Judging which feature extraction method is better according to the training results. Finally, the classifier chain is applied to the intelligent contract malicious code detection.</p></details> |  |

We observe that collaborators view the same physical world, making their features strongly correlated; thus receivers only need innovation beyond their local context. Revisiting this from a distributed source coding perspective, we propose V2X-DSC, a framework with a Conditional Codec (DCC) for bandwidth-constrained fusion. The sender compresses BEV features into compact codes, while the receiver performs conditional reconstruction using its local features as side information, allocating bits to complementary cues rather than redundant content. This conditional structure regularizes learning, encouraging incremental representation and yielding lower-noise features. Experiments on DAIR-V2X, OPV2V, and V2X-Real demonstrate state-of-the-art accuracy-bandwidth trade-offs under KB-level communication, and generalizes as a plug-and-play communication layer across multiple fusion backbones.</p></details> |  |

Since such code clones, i.e., identical or similar fragments of code, can bloat software projects and cause issues like bug or vulnerability propagation, their identification is of importance. In this paper, we present StoneDetector and its underlying method for finding code clones in Java source and Bytecode. StoneDetector implements a conventional clone detection approach based upon the textual comparison of paths derived from the code's representation by dominator trees. In this way, the tool does not only find exact and syntactically similar near-miss code clones, but also code clones that are harder to detect due to their larger variety in the syntax. We demonstrate StoneDetector's versatility as a conventional clone detection tool and analyze its various available configuration parameters, including the usage of different string metrics, hashing algorithms, etc. In our exhaustive evaluation with other conventional clone detectors on several state-of-the-art benchmarks, we can show StoneDetector's performance and scalability in finding code clones in both, Java source and Bytecode.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the accepted manuscript of a paper accepted for publication in The Journal of Systems and Software (Elsevier), the final published version will be available via the journal</p></details> |
| **[From Evaluation to Enhancement: Large Language Models for Zero-Knowledge Proof Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11708v2)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are increasingly deployed in domains such as privacy-preserving authentication, verifiable computation, and secure finance. However, authoring ZK programs remains challenging: unlike conventional software development, ZK programming manifests a fundamental paradigm shift from \textit{imperative computation} to \textit{declarative verification}. This process requires rigorous reasoning about finite field arithmetic and complex constraint systems (which is rare in common imperative languages), making it knowledge-intensive and error-prone. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong code generation capabilities in general-purpose languages, their effectiveness for ZK programming, where correctness hinges on both language mastery and constraint-level reasoning, remains unexplored. To address this gap, we propose \textsc{ZK-Eval}, a domain-specific evaluation pipeline that probes LLM capabilities on ZK programming at three levels: language knowledge, algebraic primitive competence, and end-to-end program generation. Our evaluation of four state-of-the-art LLMs reveals that while models demonstrate strong proficiency in language syntax, they struggle when implementing and composing algebraic primitives to specify correct constraint systems, frequently producing incorrect programs. Based on these insights, we introduce \textsc{ZK-Coder}, an agentic framework that augments LLMs with constraint sketching, guided retrieval, and interactive repair. Experiments with GPT-o3 on Circom and Noir show substantial gains, with success rates improving from 20.29\% to 87.85\% and from 28.38\% to 97.79\%, respectively. With \textsc{ZK-Eval} and \textsc{ZK-Coder}, we establish a new basis for systematically measuring and augmenting LLMs in ZK code generation to lower barriers for practitioners and advance privacy computing.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods, which depend on end-to-end answer generation or single-line program queries, typically exhibit limited numerical accuracy and reduced interpretability. This work introduces a commented, step-by-step code-generation framework that incorporates explicit reasoning into the Python program-generation process. The approach decomposes TableQA reasoning into multi-line executable programs with concise natural language comments, thereby promoting clearer reasoning and increasing the likelihood of generating correct code. On the WikiTableQuestions benchmark, the proposed method achieves 70.9\% accuracy using Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct, surpassing the Repanda baseline (67.6\%). Integrating the proposed framework with a robust end-to-end TableQA model via a lightweight answer-selection mechanism yields further improvements. This combined approach achieves up to 84.3\% accuracy on the WikiTableQuestions benchmark.</p></details> |  |

In pursuit of greater video compression efficiency, the AVS video coding working group launched the standardization exploration of end-to-end intelligent video coding, establishing the AVS End-to-End Intelligent Video Coding Exploration Model (AVS-EEM) project. A core design principle of AVS-EEM is its focus on practical deployment, featuring inherently low computational complexity and requiring strict adherence to the common test conditions of conventional video coding. This paper details the development history of AVS-EEM and provides a systematic introduction to its key technical framework, covering model architectures, training strategies, and inference optimizations. These innovations have collectively driven the project's rapid performance evolution, enabling continuous and significant gains under strict complexity constraints. Through over two years of iterative refinement and collaborative effort, the coding performance of AVS-EEM has seen substantial improvement. Experimental results demonstrate that its latest model achieves superior compression efficiency compared to the conventional AVS3 reference software, marking a significant step toward a deployable intelligent video coding standard.</p></details> |  |

It can help practitioners identify design trends and maintenance challenges, provide researchers with empirical data to study changes over time, and give educators real-world examples that enhance the teaching of software evolution concepts. Unfortunately, we lack tools specifically designed to support code evolution analysis. In this paper, we propose GitEvo, a multi-language and extensible tool for analyzing code evolution in Git repositories. GitEvo leverages Git frameworks and code parsing tools to integrate both Git-level and code-level analysis. We conclude by describing how GitEvo can support the development of novel empirical studies on code evolution and act as a learning tool for educators and students.

| **[Are Coding Agents Generating Over-Mocked Tests? An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00409v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coding agents have received significant adoption in software development recently. Unlike traditional LLM-based code completion tools, coding agents work with autonomy (e.g., invoking external tools) and leave visible traces in software repositories, such as authoring commits. Among their tasks, coding agents may autonomously generate software tests; however, the quality of these tests remains uncertain. In particular, excessive use of mocking can make tests harder to understand and maintain. This paper presents the first study to investigate the presence of mocks in agent-generated tests of real-world software systems. We analyzed over 1.2 million commits made in 2025 in 2,168 TypeScript, JavaScript, and Python repositories, including 48,563 commits by coding agents, 169,361 commits that modify tests, and 44,900 commits that add mocks to tests. Overall, we find that coding agents are more likely to modify tests and to add mocks to tests than non-coding agents. We detect that (1) 60% of the repositories with agent activity also contain agent test activity; (2) 23% of commits made by coding agents add/change test files, compared with 13% by non-agents; (3) 68% of the repositories with agent test activity also contain agent mock activity; (4) 36% of commits made by coding agents add mocks to tests, compared with 26% by non-agents; and (5) repositories created recently contain a higher proportion of test and mock commits made by agents. Finally, we conclude by discussing implications for developers and researchers. We call attention to the fact that tests with mocks may be potentially easier to generate automatically (but less effective at validating real interactions), and the need to include guidance on mocking practices in agent configuration files.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at MSR 2026</p></details> |
| **[GrepRAG: An Empirical Study and Optimization of Grep-Like Retrieval for Code Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23254v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repository-level code completion remains challenging for large language models (LLMs) due to cross-file dependencies and limited context windows. Prior work addresses this challenge using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks based on semantic indexing or structure-aware graph analysis, but these approaches incur substantial computational overhead for index construction and maintenance. Motivated by common developer workflows that rely on lightweight search utilities (e.g., ripgrep), we revisit a fundamental yet underexplored question: how far can simple, index-free lexical retrieval support repository-level code completion before more complex retrieval mechanisms become necessary? To answer this question, we systematically investigate lightweight, index-free, intent-aware lexical retrieval through extensive empirical analysis. We first introduce Naive GrepRAG, a baseline framework in which LLMs autonomously generate ripgrep commands to retrieve relevant context. Despite its simplicity, Naive GrepRAG achieves performance comparable to sophisticated graph-based baselines. Further analysis shows that its effectiveness stems from retrieving lexically precise code fragments that are spatially closer to the completion site. We also identify key limitations of lexical retrieval, including sensitivity to noisy matches from high-frequency ambiguous keywords and context fragmentation caused by rigid truncation boundaries. To address these issues, we propose GrepRAG, which augments lexical retrieval with a lightweight post-processing pipeline featuring identifier-weighted re-ranking and structure-aware deduplication. Extensive evaluation on CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated demonstrates that GrepRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving 7.04-15.58 percent relative improvement in code exact match (EM) over the best baseline on CrossCodeEval.</p></details> | Under Review |

Despite their prosperous development, the fundamental mechanisms underlying their robustness remain poorly understood, raising critical concerns for real-world deployment. This paper conducts a systematic empirical study to uncover the internal robustness flaws of MASs using a mutation-based methodology. By designing a testing pipeline incorporating semantic-preserving mutation operators and a novel fitness function, we assess mainstream MASs across multiple datasets and LLMs. Our findings reveal substantial robustness flaws: semantically equivalent inputs cause drastic performance drops, with MASs failing to solve 7.9\%--83.3\% of problems they initially resolved successfully. Through comprehensive failure analysis, we discover a fundamental cause underlying these robustness issues: the \textit{planner-coder gap}, which accounts for 75.3\% of failures. This gap arises from information loss in the multi-stage transformation process where planning agents decompose requirements into underspecified plans, and coding agents subsequently misinterpret intricate logic during code generation. Based on this formulated information transformation process, we propose a \textit{repairing method} that mitigates information loss through multi-prompt generation and introduces a monitor agent to bridge the planner-coder gap. Evaluation shows that our repairing method effectively enhances the robustness of MASs by solving 40.0\%--88.9\% of identified failures. Our work uncovers critical robustness flaws in MASs and provides effective mitigation strategies, contributing essential insights for developing more reliable MASs for code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>18pag...</summary><p>18pages, 5 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

ABF involves transforming a buggy method into its fixed equivalent. A common preprocessing step in ABF involves removing comments from code prior to training. However, we hypothesize that comments may play a critical role in fixing certain types of bugs by providing valuable design and implementation insights. In this study, we investigate how the presence or absence of comments, both during training and at inference time, impacts the bug-fixing capabilities of LLMs. We conduct an empirical evaluation comparing two model families, each evaluated under all combinations of training and inference conditions (with and without comments), and thereby revisiting the common practice of removing comments during training. To address the limited availability of comments in state-of-the-art datasets, we use an LLM to automatically generate comments for methods lacking them. Our findings show that comments improve ABF accuracy by up to threefold when present in both phases, while training with comments does not degrade performance when instances lack them. Additionally, an interpretability analysis identifies that comments detailing method implementation are particularly effective in aiding LLMs to fix bugs accurately.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 34th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC 2026)</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in code generation, they often struggle with the rigorous requirements of smart contracts, frequently producing code that is buggy or vulnerable. To address this, we propose SolAgent, a novel tool-augmented multi-agent framework that mimics the workflow of human experts. SolAgent integrates a \textbf{dual-loop refinement mechanism}: an inner loop using the \textit{Forge} compiler to ensure functional correctness, and an outer loop leveraging the \textit{Slither} static analyzer to eliminate security vulnerabilities. Additionally, the agent is equipped with file system capabilities to resolve complex project dependencies. Experiments on the SolEval+ Benchmark, a rigorous suite derived from high-quality real-world projects, demonstrate that SolAgent achieves a Pass@1 rate of up to \textbf{64.39\%}, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art LLMs ($\sim$25\%), AI IDEs (e.g., GitHub Copilot), and existing agent frameworks. Moreover, it reduces security vulnerabilities by up to \textbf{39.77\%} compared to human-written baselines. Finally, we demonstrate that the high-quality trajectories generated by SolAgent can be used to distill smaller, open-source models, democratizing access to secure smart contract generation. We release our data and code at https://github.com/openpaperz/SolAgent.</p></details> |  |

In practice, teams often draft multiple candidate proposals for fixing an issue and then deliberate on one golden proposal for implementation. This selection requires not only assessing the issue's scope, impact, and urgency, but also a clear understanding of each proposal's strengths and weaknesses. A good selection could make issue resolution more reliable while reducing regression and operational risk, whereas a poor choice can increase risk and even cause unpredictable failures. We first conduct a manual study of real-world issues to characterize the rationales maintainers use when selecting among competing proposals. Motivated by these findings, we introduce SWE-Manager, a joint selection and synthesis approach that selects the best proposal and synthesizes a golden proposal. SWE-Manager is an 8B model trained via reinforcement learning (RL) to compare proposals, justify its choice, and synthesize a golden proposal for implementation. We view proposal selection as a reasoning task, mirroring how technical managers review competing proposals by weighing issue context and each proposal's solution without executing code or running tests. On the SWE-Lancer Manager benchmark, SWE-Manager achieves 53.21 selection accuracy and 57.75 earn rate, earning 152,750 dollars and outperforming strong baselines including GPT-5. To further evaluate the effectiveness of SWE-Manager in real-world issue resolution, we design the P2A framework, which simulates a real-world workflow where multiple proposals are drafted, reviewed, and a golden proposal is selected for implementation ...</p></details> |  |

While powerful, training these models on user-written code introduces significant privacy risks, making the models themselves a new type of data vulnerability. Malicious actors can exploit this by launching attacks to reconstruct sensitive training data or infer whether a specific code snippet was used for training. This paper investigates the use of Differential Privacy (DP) as a robust defense mechanism for training an LLM for Kotlin code completion. We fine-tune a \texttt{Mellum} model using DP and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of its privacy and utility. Our results demonstrate that DP provides a strong defense against Membership Inference Attacks (MIAs), reducing the attack's success rate close to a random guess (AUC from 0.901 to 0.606). Furthermore, we show that this privacy guarantee comes at a minimal cost to model performance, with the DP-trained model achieving utility scores comparable to its non-private counterpart, even when trained on 100x less data. Our findings suggest that DP is a practical and effective solution for building private and trustworthy AI-powered IDE features.</p></details> | 6 pages |

We introduce BatCoder, a self-supervised reinforcement learning framework designed to jointly optimize code generation and documentation production. BatCoder employs a back-translation strategy: a documentation is first generated from code, and then the generated documentation is used to reconstruct the original code. The semantic similarity between the original and reconstructed code serves as an implicit reward, enabling reinforcement learning to improve the model's performance both in generating code from documentation and vice versa. This approach allows models to be trained using only code, substantially increasing the available training examples. Evaluated on HumanEval and MBPP with a 7B model, BatCoder achieved 83.5% and 81.0% pass@1, outperforming strong open-source baselines. Moreover, the framework demonstrates consistent scaling with respect to both training corpus size and model capacity.</p></details> |  |

We completely determine the minimum possible lengths of additive codes over GF$(9)$ of dimension $2.5$ and give improved constructions for other small parameters, including codes outperforming the best linear codes. As an application, we consider multispreads in PG$(4,q)$, in particular, completing the characterization of parameters of GF$(4)$-linear $64$-ary one-weight codes.

To bridge this gap, we introduce CATArena, a framework designed to evaluate the evolutionary capabilities of code agents via iterative tournaments. Agents engage in multi-turn tournaments and continuously refine their code through self-reflection and peer-learning based on comprehensive execution feedback. For evaluation, we propose a dual-metric system to decouple static generation proficiency from evolutionary potential. Extensive experiments reveal that an agent's evolutionary potential is not strictly correlated with its initial proficiency. Our analysis further reveals that current agents struggle to concurrently leverage both peer-learning and self-reflection for effective performance gains. Furthermore, the results validate CATArena's high extensibility and resistance to variance tasks, establishing it as a continuous and reliable standard for assessing the evolutionary capability of LLM code agents.</p></details> |  |

While reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising alternative by optimizing models through execution-driven rewards without labeled supervision, our preliminary results show that naive RL with only functionality rewards fails to generate effective unit tests for difficult branches and samples. We first theoretically analyze showing that branch coverage, sample difficulty, syntactic and functional correctness can be jointly modeled as RL rewards, where optimizing these signals can improve the reliability of unit-test-based verification. Guided by this analysis, we design syntax- and functionality-aware rewards and further propose branch- and sample-difficulty--aware RL using exponential reward shaping and static analysis metrics. With this formulation, CVeDRL achieves state-of-the-art performance with only 0.6B parameters, yielding up to 28.97% higher pass rate and 15.08% higher branch coverage than GPT-3.5, while delivering over $20\times$ faster inference than competitive baselines.

On the one hand, fast, data-free, and model-agnostic methods (e.g., NF4 or HQQ) offer maximum accessibility but suffer from functional collapse at extreme bit-rates below 4 bits. On the other hand, techniques leveraging calibration data or extensive recovery training achieve superior fidelity but impose high computational constraints and face uncertain robustness under data distribution shifts. We introduce EntQuant, the first framework to unite the advantages of these distinct paradigms. By matching the performance of data-dependent methods with the speed and universality of data-free techniques, EntQuant enables practical utility in the extreme compression regime. Our method decouples numerical precision from storage cost via entropy coding, compressing a 70B parameter model in less than 30 minutes. We demonstrate that EntQuant does not only achieve state-of-the-art results on standard evaluation sets and models, but also retains functional performance on more complex benchmarks with instruction-tuned models, all at modest inference overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[RealSec-bench: A Benchmark for Evaluating Secure Code Generation in Real-World Repositories](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22706v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, but their proficiency in producing secure code remains a critical, under-explored area. Existing benchmarks often fall short by relying on synthetic vulnerabilities or evaluating functional correctness in isolation, failing to capture the complex interplay between functionality and security found in real-world software. To address this gap, we introduce RealSec-bench, a new benchmark for secure code generation meticulously constructed from real-world, high-risk Java repositories. Our methodology employs a multi-stage pipeline that combines systematic SAST scanning with CodeQL, LLM-based false positive elimination, and rigorous human expert validation. The resulting benchmark contains 105 instances grounded in real-word repository contexts, spanning 19 Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) types and exhibiting a wide diversity of data flow complexities, including vulnerabilities with up to 34-hop inter-procedural dependencies. Using RealSec-bench, we conduct an extensive empirical study on 5 popular LLMs. We introduce a novel composite metric, SecurePass@K, to assess both functional correctness and security simultaneously. We find that while Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques can improve functional correctness, they provide negligible benefits to security. Furthermore, explicitly prompting models with general security guidelines often leads to compilation failures, harming functional correctness without reliably preventing vulnerabilities. Our work highlights the gap between functional and secure code generation in current LLMs.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[AACR-Bench: Evaluating Automatic Code Review with Holistic Repository-Level Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19494v3)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality evaluation benchmarks are pivotal for deploying Large Language Models (LLMs) in Automated Code Review (ACR). However, existing benchmarks suffer from two critical limitations: first, the lack of multi-language support in repository-level contexts, which restricts the generalizability of evaluation results; second, the reliance on noisy, incomplete ground truth derived from raw Pull Request (PR) comments, which constrains the scope of issue detection. To address these challenges, we introduce AACR-Bench a comprehensive benchmark that provides full cross-file context across multiple programming languages. Unlike traditional datasets, AACR-Bench employs an "AI-assisted, Expert-verified" annotation pipeline to uncover latent defects often overlooked in original PRs, resulting in a 285% increase in defect coverage. Extensive evaluations of mainstream LLMs on AACR-Bench reveal that previous assessments may have either misjudged or only partially captured model capabilities due to data limitations. Our work establishes a more rigorous standard for ACR evaluation and offers new insights on LLM based ACR, i.e., the granularity/level of context and the choice of retrieval methods significantly impact ACR performance, and this influence varies depending on the LLM, programming language, and the LLM usage paradigm e.g., whether an Agent architecture is employed. The code, data, and other artifacts of our evaluation set are available at https://github.com/alibaba/aacr-bench .</p></details> |  |
| **[Function-Correcting Codes for Insertion-Deletion Channel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07243v2)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In coding theory, handling errors that occur when symbols are inserted or deleted from a transmitted message is a long-standing challenge. Optimising redundancy for insertion and deletion channels remains a key open problem with significant importance for applications in DNA data storage and document exchange. Recently, a coding framework known as function-correcting codes has been proposed to address the challenge of minimising redundancy while preserving specific functions of the message. This framework has gained attention due to its potential applications in machine learning systems and long-term archival data storage. Motivated by the problem of redundancy optimisation for insertion and deletion channels, we propose a new framework called function-correcting codes for insdel channels. In this paper, we introduce the notions of function-correcting insertion codes, function-correcting deletion codes, and function-correcting insdel codes, and we show that these three formulations are equivalent. We then define insdel distance matrices and irregular insdel-distance codes, and derive lower and upper bounds on the optimal redundancy achievable by function-correcting codes for insdel channels. In addition, we establish Gilbert-Varshamov and Plotkin-like bounds on the length of irregular insdel-distance codes. Using the relation between optimal redundancy and the length of such codes, we obtain a simplified lower bound on optimal redundancy. Finally, we derive bounds on the optimal redundancy of function-correcting insdel codes for several classes of functions, including locally bounded functions, VT syndrome functions, the number-of-runs function, and the maximum-run-length function.</p></details> |  |

A quantum $(r,δ)$-LRC, $Q(C)$, can be constructed from an $(r,δ)$-LRC, $C$, which is Euclidean or Hermitian dual-containing. This article is devoted to studying how to get quantum $(r,δ)$-LRCs from BCH and homothetic-BCH codes. As a consequence, we give pure quantum $(r,δ)$-LRCs which are optimal for the Singleton-like bound.</p></details> | 19 pages, 1 table |

Spec-driven development (SDD) inverts the traditional workflow by treating specifications as the source of truth and code as a generated or verified secondary artifact. This paper provides practitioners with a comprehensive guide to SDD, covering its principles, workflow patterns, and supporting tools. We present three levels of specification rigor-spec-first, spec-anchored, and spec-as-source-with clear guidance on when each applies. Through analysis of tools ranging from Behavior-Driven Development frameworks to modern AI-assisted toolkits like GitHub Spec Kit, we demonstrate how the spec-first philosophy maps to real implementations. We present case studies from API development, enterprise systems, and embedded software, illustrating how different domains apply SDD. We conclude with a decision framework helping practitioners determine when SDD provides value and when simpler approaches suffice.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to AIWare 2026. 8 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

As a result, redundancy removal is left solely to the entropy coder, overburdening the entropy coding module and reducing rate-distortion (R-D) performance. To fix this critical omission, we propose a training-time transform coding (TTC) method that adds the analysis-synthesis transform and optimizes it jointly with the 3DGS representation and entropy model. Concretely, we adopt a hierarchical design: a channel-wise KLT for decorrelation and energy compaction, followed by a sparsity-aware neural transform that reconstructs the KLT residuals with minimal parameter and computational overhead. Experiments show that our method delivers strong R-D performance with fast decoding, offering a favorable BD-rate-decoding-time trade-off over SOTA 3DGS compressors.</p></details> | <details><summary>Our c...</summary><p>Our code will be released at \href{https://github.com/hxu160/SHTC_for_3DGS_compression}{here}</p></details> |

Furthermore, suppose a tree decomposition corresponding to the treewidth of the binary linear code is known. In that case, we also provide a specific algorithm to compute the minimum \(a\) and the number of the corresponding \((a, b)\)-trapping sets for a given \(b\) with linear complexity. Simulation experiments are presented to verify the correctness of the proposed algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>low-d...</summary><p>low-density parity-check codes, tree decomposition, trapping sets, NP-complete</p></details> |

However, no explicit \emph{qubit} qLDPC family is known that simultaneously has constant rate, linear distance, bounded stabilizer weight, and a native \emph{magic-state fountain} that prepares many non-Clifford resource states in constant depth. We take a structural approach and identify coding-theoretic conditions under which a CSS qLDPC family necessarily supports a constant-depth $\CCZ$ magic-state fountain. The key ingredients are: (i) an algebraic notion of \emph{magic-friendly triples} of $X$-type logical operators, defined by pairwise orthogonality and a triple-overlap form controlling diagonal $\CCZ$ phases, and (ii) a 3-uniform hypergraph model of physical $\CCZ$ circuits combined with a packing lemma that turns large collections of such triples with bounded overlaps into bounded-degree hypergraphs. Our main theorem shows that if a CSS code family on $n$ qubits admits $Ω(n^{1+γ})$ magic-friendly triples whose supports have bounded per-qubit participation, then there exists a constant-depth circuit of physical $\CCZ$ gates implementing $Ω(n^γ)$ logical $\CCZ$ gates in parallel while preserving distance up to a constant factor. For asymptotically good qLDPC families such as quantum Tanner codes, this reduces the existence of a native $\CCZ$ magic-state fountain to a concrete combinatorial problem about counting and distributing magic-friendly triples in the logical $X$ space.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, 2 lemmas, 1 theorem</p></details> |
| **[Successive Cancellation List Decoding of Extended Reed-Solomon Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22482v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reed-Solomon (RS) codes are an important class of non-binary error-correction codes. They are particularly competent in correcting burst errors, being widely applied in modern communications and data storage systems. This also thanks to their distance property of reaching the Singleton bound, being the maximum distance separable (MDS) codes. This paper proposes a new list decoding for extended RS (eRS) codes defined over a finite field of characteristic two, i.e., F_{2^n}. It is developed based on transforming an eRS code into n binary polar codes. Consequently, it can be decoded by the successive cancellation (SC) decoding and further their list decoding, i.e., the SCL decoding. A pre-transformed matrix is required for reinterpretating the eRS codes, which also determines their SC and SCL decoding performances. Its column linear independence property is studied, leading to theoretical characterization of their SC decoding performance. Our proposed decoding and analysis are validated numerically.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been submitted to ISIT 2026</p></details> |
| **[5G LDPC Codes as Root LDPC Codes via Diversity Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22470v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the diversity of protographbased quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes over nonergodic block-fading channels under iterative beliefpropagation decoding. We introduce diversity evolution (DivE), a Boolean-function-based analysis method that tracks how the fading dependence of belief-propagation messages evolves across decoding iterations. Under a Boolean approximation of block fading, DivE derives a Boolean fading function for each variable node (VN) output (i.e., the a-posteriori reliability after iterative decoding), from which the VN diversity order can be directly determined. Building on this insight, we develop a greedy blockmapping search that assigns protograph VNs to fading blocks so that all information VNs achieve full diversity, while including the minimum additional parity VNs when full diversity is infeasible at the nominal rate. Numerical results on the 5G New Radio LDPC codes show that the proposed search finds block mappings that guarantee full diversity for all information bits without modifying the base-graph structure, yielding a markedly steeper high-SNR slope and lower BLER than random mappings.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Estimating the Decoding Failure Rate of Binary Regular Codes Using Iterative Decoding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16919v4)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Providing closed-form estimates of the decoding failure rate of iterative decoders for low- and moderate-density binary parity-check codes has attracted significant interest in the research community. Recently, interest in this topic has increased due to the use of iterative decoders in post-quantum cryptosystems, where the desired decoding failure rates (DFRs) are less than or equal to $2^{-128}$ and impossible to estimate via Monte Carlo simulations. We propose a new technique that provides accurate DFR estimates for a two-iteration (parallel) bit-flipping decoder that can be used for cryptographic purposes. We estimate the bit-flipping probabilities at the second decoder iteration and the syndrome weight distribution before and after the first iteration as a function of the code parameters and error weight. We validate our results numerically by comparing the modelled and simulated syndrome weights, the incorrectly guessed error bit distribution at the end of the first iteration, and the DFR after two iterations in both the floor and waterfall regimes. Finally, we apply our method to estimate the DFR of the LEDAcrypt cryptographic system, a post-quantum key encapsulation method that employs a two-iteration bit-flipping decoder. We show that the DFR estimate resulting from the chosen code parameters can be improved by a factor larger than $2^{70}$ with respect to previous estimation techniques, when $128$-bit security is required. This allows for a $20$% reduction in public key and ciphertext sizes at no security loss. We note that our results can be applied to the post-quantum cryptosystem known as Bit Flipping Key Encapsulation (BIKE) replacing the current ``BIKE-flip decoder'' with the two-iteration decoder and consequently endowing BIKE with the property of indistinguishability under an adaptive chosen-ciphertext attack (IND-CCA$2$), provably.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full editorial revision of the manuscript, added section 3.d quantifying the effect of Assumption 1</p></details> |

We introduce MetaLint, a training framework that treats code quality analysis as detecting best practice violations from high-level specifications over semantic code fragments (code idioms). Instead of training on a fixed set of rules, MetaLint reorganizes supervision around dynamically specified best practices using synthetic linter-derived labels, integrated with instruction-following and preference optimization. This encourages extrapolation to more complex, unseen best practices at test time, consistent with easy-to-hard generalization without retraining. To evaluate MetaLint, we create a new benchmark of hard-to-detect best practices inspired by Python Enhancement Proposals. Across this benchmark, MetaLint improves generalization to unseen best practices. Qwen3-4B achieves a 2.7x detection F-score gain (25.9% -> 70.4%), the highest recall, and a 26.7% localization F-score, matching larger models such as o3-mini. These gains generalize across programming languages, model families, scales, reasoning settings, and linter sources.</p></details> |  |
| **[FunPRM: Function-as-Step Process Reward Model with Meta Reward Correction for Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22249v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation is a core application of large language models (LLMs), yet LLMs still frequently fail on complex programming tasks. Given its success in mathematical reasoning, test-time scaling approaches such as Process Reward Model (PRM)-based Best-of-N selection offer a promising way to improve performance. However, existing PRMs remain ineffective for code generation due to the lack of meaningful step decomposition in code and the noise of Monte Carlo-estimated partial-solution correctness scores (rewards). To address these challenges, we propose FunPRM. FunPRM prompts LLMs to encourage modular code generation organized into functions, with functions treated as PRM reasoning steps. Furthermore, FunPRM introduces a novel meta-learning-based reward correction mechanism that leverages clean final-solution rewards obtained via a unit-test-based evaluation system to purify noisy partial-solution rewards. Experiments on LiveCodeBench and BigCodeBench demonstrate that FunPRM consistently outperforms existing test-time scaling methods across five base LLMs, notably achieving state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench when combined with O4-mini. Furthermore, FunPRM produces code that is more readable and reusable for developers.</p></details> |  |
| **[DAJ: Data-Reweighted LLM Judge for Test-Time Scaling in Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.22230v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling for code generation commonly relies on Best-of-N selection, in which multiple candidate solutions are sampled from a base model, and the best one is selected by an LLM judge. However, training reliable LLM judges is challenging due to severe distribution shifts, including imbalances between easy and hard problems, mismatches between training tasks and evaluation benchmarks, and trajectory mismatch arising from training data generated by cheaper models whose behavior differs from that of inference-time models. We propose DAJ, a reasoning-based LLM judge trained with verifiable rewards under a bi-level data-reweighted learning framework. The proposed framework learns data-importance weights (either domain-level or instance-level) to optimize generalization performance on a held-out meta set aligned with target benchmarks. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of data reweighting to LLM-as-a-Judge training for test-time scaling. Our approach automatically emphasizes hard problems, in-distribution samples, and trajectory-aligned data, without relying on hand-crafted heuristics. Empirically, DAJ achieves state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench and BigCodeBench, outperforming strong test-time scaling baselines as well as leading proprietary models.</p></details> |  |

We investigate how cognitive capability and personality traits are associated with software problem solving accuracy. We assessed cognitive capability using Baddeley's three-minute grammatical reasoning test. Personality was measured using the IPIP-NEO-50 test. Eighty participants (40 software practitioners and 40 software engineering students) completed these two tests with nine interview-style problem solving tasks, comprising six coding-related and three logical-reasoning questions. Our practitioners achieved slightly higher grammatical reasoning accuracy than students, although this difference was not statistically significant. Students achieved higher accuracy on the coding and logical-reasoning tasks. For all, grammatical reasoning accuracy was positively correlated with problem solving accuracy, indicating that individuals with higher reasoning accuracy tended to perform better on applied problem solving tasks. Conscientiousness was the strongest personality-related association, positively correlated with both grammatical reasoning and problem solving accuracy. Openness to experience was also positively correlated with grammatical reasoning and problem solving accuracy. Neuroticism showed a small negative correlation with problem solving accuracy and weak negative correlation with grammatical reasoning accuracy. Practical implications for education and industry include integrating structured reasoning tasks in curricula, and considering the interplay of personality and cognition in recruitment and role allocation.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, 6 tables, 19th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Cooperative and Human Aspects of Software Engineering (CHASE 2026)</p></details> |

Recent work suggests that exposure to code can further enhance these skills, but existing studies largely treat code as a generic training signal, leaving open the question of which properties of code actually contribute to improved reasoning. To address this gap, we study the structural complexity of code, which captures control flow and compositional structure that may shape how models internalise multi-step reasoning during fine-tuning. We examine two complementary settings: solution-driven complexity, where complexity varies across multiple solutions to the same problem, and problem-driven complexity, where complexity reflects variation in the underlying tasks. Using cyclomatic complexity and logical lines of code to construct controlled fine-tuning datasets, we evaluate a range of open-weight LLMs on diverse reasoning benchmarks. Our findings show that although code can improve reasoning, structural properties strongly determine its usefulness. In 83% of experiments, restricting fine-tuning data to a specific structural complexity range outperforms training on structurally diverse code, pointing to a data-centric path for improving reasoning beyond scaling.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

As learning becomes increasingly personalized, considering individual learner characteristics becomes more important. This study investigates the moderating effect of spatial ability on learning experience with AR in the context of robot programming. A between-subjects experiment ($N=71$) compared conventional robot programming to an AR-assisted approach using a head-mounted display. Participants' spatial ability was assessed using the Mental Rotation Test. The learning experience was measured through the System Usability Scale (SUS) and cognitive load. The results indicate that AR support does not significantly improve the learning experience compared to the conventional approach. However, AR appears to have a compensatory effect on the influence of spatial ability. In the control group, spatial ability was significantly positively associated with SUS scores and negatively associated with extraneous cognitive load, indicating that higher spatial ability predicts a better learning experience. In the AR condition, these relationships were not observable, suggesting that AR mitigated the disadvantage typically experienced by learners with lower spatial abilities. These findings suggest that AR can serve a compensatory function by reducing the influence of learner characteristics. Future research should further explore this compensatory role of AR to guide the design of personalized learning environments that address diverse learner needs and reduce barriers for learners with varying cognitive profiles.</p></details> |  |

To explore the effectiveness of agentic workflows, we propose CP-Agent, a Python coding agent that uses the ReAct framework with a persistent IPython kernel. We provide the relevant domain knowledge as a project prompt of under 50 lines. The algorithm works by iteratively executing code, observing the solver's feedback, and refining constraint models based on execution results. We evaluate CP-Agent on 101 constraint programming problems from CP-Bench. We made minor changes to the benchmark to address systematic ambiguities in the problem specifications and errors in the ground-truth models. On the clarified benchmark, CP-Agent achieves perfect accuracy on all 101 problems. Our experiments show that minimal guidance outperforms detailed procedural scaffolding. Our experiments also show that explicit task management tools can have both positive and negative effects on focused modeling tasks.</p></details> |  |

This ambiguity-averse MDP framework unifies several models of MDPs with epistemic uncertainty for specific choices of risk measures. We extend the concepts of value functions and Bellman operators to our setting. Based on these objects, we establish the consequences of dynamic programming principles in this framework (existence of stationary policies, value and policy iteration algorithms), and we completely characterize law-invariant risk measures compatible with dynamic programming. Our work draws connections among several variants of MDP models and fully delineates what is possible under the dynamic programming paradigm and which risk measures require leaving it.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraint Matters: Multi-Modal Representation for Reducing Mixed-Integer Linear programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18742v3)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction, which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation time by 17.47\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accec...</summary><p>Accecpted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |

BayeSQP employs second-order Gaussian process surrogates for both the objective and constraints to jointly model the function values, gradients, and Hessian from only zero-order information. At each iteration, a local subproblem is constructed using the GP posterior estimates and solved to obtain a search direction. Crucially, the formulation of the subproblem explicitly incorporates uncertainty in both the function and derivative estimates, resulting in a tractable second-order cone program for high probability improvements under model uncertainty. A subsequent one-dimensional line search via constrained Thompson sampling selects the next evaluation point. Empirical results show thatBayeSQP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in specific high-dimensional settings. Our algorithm offers a principled and flexible framework that bridges classical optimization techniques with modern approaches to black-box optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[HALF: Hollowing Analysis Framework for Binary Programs with Kernel Module Assistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22043v3)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary program analysis represents a fundamental pillar of modern system security. Fine-grained methodologies like dynamic taint analysis still suffer from deployment complexity and performance overhead despite significant progress. Traditional in-process analysis tools trigger severe \textbf{address-space conflicts} that inevitably disrupt the native memory layout of the target. These conflicts frequently cause layout-sensitive exploits and evasive malware to deviate from their intended execution paths or fail entirely. This paper introduces \textbf{HALF} as a novel framework that resolves this fundamental tension while ensuring both analysis fidelity and practical performance. HALF achieves high-fidelity address-space transparency by leveraging a kernel-assisted process hollowing mechanism. This design effectively eliminates the observation artifacts that characterize traditional instrumentation tools. We further mitigate the synchronization latency of decoupled execution by implementing an exception-driven strategy via a lightweight kernel monitor. Extensive evaluation of a Windows-based prototype demonstrates that HALF maintains superior performance compared to conventional in-process baselines. HALF also provides unique capabilities for deconstructing complex, stealthy threats where existing frameworks fail to maintain execution integrity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM-based Specification Generation via Program Slicing and Logical Deletion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09917v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional formal specification generation methods are typically tailored to specific specification types, and therefore suffer from limited generality. In recent years, large language model (LLM)-based specification generation approaches have emerged, offering a new direction for improving the universality of automated specification synthesis. However, when dealing with complex control flow, LLMs often struggle to precisely generate complete specifications that cover substructures. Moreover, the distinctive verification pipelines adopted by existing approaches may incorrectly discard logically correct specifications, while verification tools alone cannot reliably identify correct specifications. To address these issues, we propose SLD-Spec, an LLM-based specification generation method that combines program slicing and logical deletion. Specifically, SLD-Spec augments the conventional specification generation framework with two key stages: (1) a program slicing stage that decomposes the target function into several smaller code slices, enabling LLMs to focus on more localized semantic structures and thereby improving specification relevance and completeness; and (2) a logical deletion stage that leverages LLMs to perform logical reasoning and filtering over candidate specifications so as to retain logically correct ones. Experimental results show that SLD-Spec consistently outperforms existing methods on datasets containing programs of varying complexity, verifying more programs and generating specifications that are more relevant and more complete. Further ablation studies indicate that program slicing mainly improves specification relevance and completeness, whereas logical deletion plays a key role in increasing verification success rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Optimal Classification Trees: A Mixed-Integer Programming Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02173v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global optimization of decision trees is a long-standing challenge in combinatorial optimization, yet such models play an important role in interpretable machine learning. Although the problem has been investigated for several decades, only recent advances in discrete optimization have enabled practical algorithms for solving optimal classification tree problems on real-world datasets. Mixed-integer programming (MIP) offers a high degree of modeling flexibility, and we therefore propose a MIP-based framework for learning optimal classification trees under nonlinear performance metrics, such as the F1-score, that explicitly addresses class imbalance. To improve scalability, we develop problem-specific acceleration techniques, including a tailored branch-and-cut algorithm, an instance-reduction scheme, and warm-start strategies. We evaluate the proposed approach on 50 benchmark datasets. The computational results show that the framework can efficiently optimize nonlinear metrics while achieving strong predictive performance and reduced solution times compared with existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Programming Language Confusion: When Code LLMs Can't Keep their Languages Straight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13620v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance across software engineering tasks, from code generation to translation. However, we identify and systematically evaluate a critical failure mode: Programming Language Confusion (PLC) -- the generation of code in unintended languages despite explicit instructions. Through evaluation of 10 popular LLMs across six multilingual datasets (LiveCodeBench, BabelCode variants, HumanEval-XL, and McEval), we demonstrate that PLC is pervasive, with some specialized models exhibiting the highest confusion rates. Our analysis reveals that PLC is not random noise but reflects systematic patterns: models consistently generate syntactically valid code even when it deviates from language specifications. This behavior produces distinct language migration patterns, most notably a strong default to Python and systematic shifts between syntactically similar language pairs (e.g., C#/Java). These migrations reflect statistical preferences learned from training data rather than goal-directed reasoning. We demonstrate that explicit language keywords provide the most effective mitigation, while natural language instructions have limited influence on model behavior. Furthermore, model quantization -- though essential for practical deployment -- significantly amplifies PLC and degrades syntactic stability in complex tasks. Our findings underscore that language fidelity should be treated as a core evaluation dimension for code LLMs. We advocate for standardized benchmarks and prompt formats with explicit language constraints to enable more reliable assessment and foster the development of robust, multilingual code generation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at SANER 2026</p></details> |

Unlike prior methods based on merit functions or the augmented Lagrangian class of algorithms, FilterDDP uses a step filter in conjunction with a line search to handle equality constraints. We identify two important design choices for the step filter criteria which lead to robust numerical performance: 1) we use the Lagrangian instead of the cost in the step acceptance criterion and, 2) in the backward pass, we perturb the value function Hessian. Both choices are rigorously justified, for 2) in particular by a formal proof of local quadratic convergence. In addition to providing a primal-dual interior point extension for handling OCPs with both equality and inequality constraints, we validate FilterDDP on three contact implicit trajectory optimisation problems which arise in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2026</p></details> |

We present ASP-Bench, a benchmark comprising 128 natural language problem instances, 64 base problems with easy and hard variants. It evaluates systems that translate natural-language problems into Answer Set Programs (ASPs), a prominent form of logic programming. It provides systematic coverage of ASP features, including choice rules, aggregates, and optimization. Each problem includes reference validators that check whether solutions satisfy the problem specification. We characterize problems along seven largely independent reasoning aspects (optimization, temporal reasoning, default logic, resource allocation, recursion, spatial reasoning, and quantitative complexity), providing a multidimensional view of modeling difficulty. We test the benchmark using an agentic approach based on the ReAct (Reason and Act) framework, which achieves full saturation, demonstrating that feedback-driven iterative refinement with solver feedback provides a reliable and robust approach for modeling natural language in ASP. Our analysis across multiple agent runs enables us to gain insights into what determines a problem's modeling hardness.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate a critical question: Can we elevate models to expert-level reasoning performance using fully synthetic data? In response, we first observe that off-the-shelf synthesis methods yield suboptimal results in this domain. To address this, we systematically investigate the key factors governing synthetic data quality. Leveraging these findings, we significantly advance the feature-based synthesis paradigm via domain-specific evolution and a dual-verification strategy, promoting task solvability, solution correctness, and test accuracy. Using this high-quality synthetic data, we train the X-Coder model series under an SFT-then-RL paradigm. X-Coder-7B shows significant performance gains on the challenging LiveCodeBench v5 (62.9% avg@8) and v6 (55.8% avg@8), outperforming larger models trained on real-world data. Extensive analysis distills valuable insights into synthetic data scaling, the necessity of domain-adapted feature evolution, and code-centric reinforcement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code:...</summary><p>Code: https://github.com/JieWu02/X-Coder; Data: https://huggingface.co/datasets/IIGroup/X-Coder-SFT-376k</p></details> |

Inspired by the cognitive science of how people form abstractions and intuitive theories of their world knowledge, Theory-Based RL (TBRL) systems, such as TheoryCoder, exhibit strong generalization through effective use of abstractions. However, they heavily rely on human-provided abstractions and sidestep the abstraction-learning problem. We introduce TheoryCoder-2, a new TBRL agent that leverages LLMs' in-context learning ability to actively learn reusable abstractions rather than relying on hand-specified ones, by synthesizing abstractions from experience and integrating them into a hierarchical planning process. We conduct experiments on diverse environments, including BabyAI, Minihack and VGDL games like Sokoban. We find that TheoryCoder-2 is significantly more sample-efficient than baseline LLM agents augmented with classical planning domain construction, reasoning-based planning, and prior program-synthesis agents such as WorldCoder. TheoryCoder-2 is able to solve complex tasks that the baselines fail, while only requiring minimal human prompts, unlike prior TBRL systems.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Given a natural language goal and an evaluation method, KAPSO iteratively performs ideation, code synthesis and editing, execution, evaluation, and learning to improve a runnable artifact toward measurable objectives. Rather than treating synthesis as the endpoint, KAPSO uses synthesis as an operator within a long-horizon optimization loop, where progress is defined by evaluator outcomes. KAPSO targets long-horizon failures common in coding agents, including lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak reuse of domain expertise, by integrating three tightly coupled components. First, a git-native experimentation engine isolates each attempt as a branch, producing reproducible artifacts and preserving provenance across iterations. Second, a knowledge system ingests heterogeneous sources, including repositories, internal playbooks, and curated external resources such as documentation, scientific papers, and web search results, and organizes them into a structured representation that supports retrieval over workflows, implementations, and environment constraints. Third, a cognitive memory layer coordinates retrieval and maintains an episodic store of reusable lessons distilled from experiment traces (run logs, diffs, and evaluator feedback), reducing repeated error modes and accelerating convergence. We evaluated KAPSO on MLE-Bench (Kaggle-style ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic optimization), and report end-to-end performance.

| **[ScratchEval : A Multimodal Evaluation Framework for LLMs in Block-Based Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00757v1)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have achieved strong performance on text-based programming tasks, yet they remain unreliable for block-based languages such as Scratch. Scratch programs exhibit deeply nested, non-linear structures, event-driven concurrency across multiple sprites, and tight coupling between code and multimedia assets, properties that differ fundamentally from textual code. As a result, LLMs often misinterpret Scratch semantics and generate large, invasive edits that are syntactically valid but semantically incorrect when repairing buggy programs. We introduce ScratchEval, the first executable benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair for Scratch programs, covering program understanding, debugging, analysis, and repair. The benchmark contains 100 curated Scratch projects from the public repository, selected for structural and semantic complexity. Each project is paired with executable test suites, bug descriptions with corresponding fixes, block-level edit constraints defining minimal semantically correct repairs, and required multimedia assets. The benchmark is constructed through a human-in-the-loop pipeline combining automated project mining with expert validation of trigger-outcome semantics and representative bug patterns, with emphasis on event ordering, concurrency, and state management. To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we propose a three-layer executable protocol measuring functional correctness via VM-level execution, repair quality using block-level edit distance and behavioral trajectory comparisons, and explanation quality via structured rubrics assessing alignment between model reasoning and generated patches. Using ScratchEval, we study domain-specific fine-tuning, training data effectiveness, and model generalization to unseen bug types. ScratchEval provides a reproducible foundation for evaluating and post-training LLMs on block-based programming tasks.</p></details> |  |

Despite progress in basic shape-morphing design with simple geometries, achieving advanced applications such as conformal implant deployment or aerodynamic morphing requires accurate and diverse morphing designs on complex geometries, which remains challenging. Here, we present a Spectral and Spatial Neural Operator (S2NO), which enables high-fidelity morphing prediction on complex geometries. S2NO effectively captures global and local morphing behaviours on irregular computational domains by integrating Laplacian eigenfunction encoding and spatial convolutions. Combining S2NO with evolutionary algorithms enables voxel-level optimisation of material distributions for shape morphing programming on various complex geometries, including irregular-boundary shapes, porous structures, and thin-walled structures. Furthermore, the neural operator's discretisation-invariant property enables super-resolution material distribution design, further expanding the diversity and complexity of morphing design. These advancements significantly improve the efficiency and capability of programming complex shape morphing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combinatorial Algorithm for Tropical Linearly Factorized Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07596v3)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tropical semiring is an algebraic system with addition ``$\max$'' and multiplication ``$+$''. As well as in conventional algebra, linear programming in the tropical semiring has been developed. In this study, we introduce a new type of tropical optimization problem, namely, tropical linearly factorized programming. This problem involves minimizing the objective function given by a product of tropical linear forms divided by a tropical monomial, subject to tropical linear inequality constraints. As the objective function is equivalent to the dual of the transportation problem, it is convex in the conventional sense but not in the tropical sense, while the feasible set is convex in the tropical sense but not in the conventional sense. Our algorithm for tropical linearly factorized programming is based on the descent method. We first show that a feasible descent direction can be characterized in terms of a specific digraph, called a tangent digraph. Especially in non-degenerate cases, we present a simplex-like algorithm that updates the tree structure of tangent digraphs iteratively. Each iteration can be executed in $O(r_A+r_C)$ time, where $r_A$ and $r_C$ are the numbers of finite coefficients in the constraints and objective function, respectively. For integer instances, our algorithm finds a local optimum in pseudo-polynomial time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Analyzing N-language Polyglot Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00303v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Polyglot programming is gaining popularity as developers integrate multiple programming languages to harness their individual strengths. With the recent popularity of platforms like GraalVM and other multi-language runtimes, creating and managing these systems has become much more feasible. However, current research on analyzing multilingual programs mainly focuses on two languages, leaving out the increasing complexity of systems that use three or more. For example, modern web systems often link JavaScript, WebAssembly, and Rust within the same execution chain. This paper envisions the landscape of software systems with three-language polyglot communication. We identify fundamental challenges in analyzing them and propose a conceptual roadmap to advance static analysis techniques to address them. Our vision aims to stimulate discussion and inspire new research directions toward scalable, language-agnostic analysis frameworks for next-generation polyglot systems.</p></details> |  |

We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can accelerate program verification by generating useful loop invariants. We introduce Quokka, a first-order and effective framework for LLM-based invariant synthesis that provides sound evaluation while achieving state-of-the-art speedup results. Unlike prior work that designs complex, highly customized algorithms, Quokka employs a simple and principled verification procedure. We construct a benchmark of 866 instances and evaluate 9 state-of-the-art LLMs across multiple model families. Our results show that Quokka consistently outperforms all prior LLM-based verifiers: achieving speedups of at least 1.2x on 81 instances compared to 39 instances for the previous best approach. We further demonstrate that supervised fine-tuning and Best-of-N sampling can yield measurable improvements in accelerating verification.</p></details> |  |
| **[SuperCoder: Assembly Program Superoptimization with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11480v3)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superoptimization is the task of transforming a program into a faster one while preserving its input-output behavior. In this work, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as superoptimizers, generating assembly programs that outperform code already optimized by industry-standard compilers. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for this problem, consisting of 8,072 assembly programs averaging 130 lines, in contrast to prior datasets restricted to 2-15 straight-line, loop-free programs. We evaluate 23 LLMs on this benchmark and find that the strongest baseline, Claude-opus-4, achieves a 51.5% test-passing rate and a 1.43x average speedup over gcc -O3. To further enhance performance, we fine-tune models with reinforcement learning, optimizing a reward function that integrates correctness and performance speedup. Starting from Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct (61.4% correctness, 1.10x speedup), the fine-tuned model SuperCoder attains 95.0% correctness and 1.46x average speedup, with additional improvement enabled by Best-of-N sampling and iterative refinement. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that LLMs can be applied as superoptimizers for assembly programs, establishing a foundation for future research in program performance optimization beyond compiler heuristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving 4-Block Integer Linear Programs Faster Using Affine Decompositions of the Right-Hand Sides](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23083v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a new and faster algorithm for the 4-block integer linear programming problem, overcoming the long-standing runtime barrier faced by previous algorithms that rely on Graver complexity or proximity bounds. The 4-block integer linear programming problem asks to compute $\min\{c_0^\top x_0+c_1^\top x_1+\dots+c_n^\top x_n\ \vert\ Ax_0+Bx_1+\dots+Bx_n=b_0,\ Cx_0+Dx_i=b_i\ \forall i\in[n],\ (x_0,x_1,\dots,x_n)\in\mathbb Z_{\ge0}^{(1+n)k}\}$ for some $k\times k$ matrices $A,B,C,D$ with coefficients bounded by $\overlineΔ$ in absolute value. Our algorithm runs in time $f(k,\overlineΔ)\cdot n^{k+\mathcal O(1)}$, improving upon the previous best running time of $f(k,\overlineΔ)\cdot n^{k^2+\mathcal O(1)}$ [Oertel, Paat, and Weismantel (Math. Prog. 2024), Chen, Koutecký, Xu, and Shi (ESA 2020)]. Further, we give the first algorithm that can handle large coefficients in $A, B$ and $C$, that is, it has a running time that depends only polynomially on the encoding length of these coefficients. We obtain these results by extending the $n$-fold integer linear programming algorithm of Cslovjecsek, Koutecký, Lassota, Pilipczuk, and Polak (SODA 2024) to incorporate additional global variables $x_0$. The central technical result is showing that the exhaustive use of the vector rearrangement lemma of Cslovjecsek, Eisenbrand, Pilipczuk, Venzin, and Weismantel (ESA 2021) can be made \emph{affine} by carefully guessing both the residue of the global variables modulo a large modulus and a face in a suitable hyperplane arrangement among a sufficiently small number of candidates. This facilitates a dynamic high-multiplicy encoding of a \emph{faithfully decomposed} $n$-fold ILP with bounded right-hand sides, which we can solve efficiently for each such guess.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum speedups for linear programming via interior point methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03215v3)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a quantum algorithm based on an interior point method for solving a linear program with $n$ inequality constraints on $d$ variables. The algorithm explicitly returns a feasible solution that is $\varepsilon$-close to optimal, and runs in time $\sqrt{n} \cdot \mathrm{poly}(d,\log(n),\log(1/\varepsilon))$ which is sublinear for tall linear programs (i.e., $n \gg d$). Our algorithm speeds up the Newton step in the state-of-the-art interior point method of Lee and Sidford [FOCS '14]. This requires us to efficiently approximate the Hessian and gradient of the barrier function, and these are our main contributions. To approximate the Hessian, we describe a quantum algorithm for the \emph{spectral approximation} of $A^T A$ for a tall matrix $A \in \mathbb R^{n \times d}$. The algorithm uses leverage score sampling in combination with Grover search, and returns a $δ$-approximation by making $O(\sqrt{nd}/δ)$ row queries to $A$. This generalizes an earlier quantum speedup for graph sparsification by Apers and de Wolf [FOCS '20]. To approximate the gradient, we use a recent quantum algorithm for multivariate mean estimation by Cornelissen, Hamoudi and Jerbi [STOC '22]. While a naive implementation introduces a dependence on the condition number of the Hessian, we avoid this by pre-conditioning our random variable using our quantum algorithm for spectral approximation.</p></details> | 47 pages |

Numerous synthesizers have been developed for program synthesis, offering different approaches to the exponentially growing program space. Although such state-of-the-art tools exist, reusing and adapting them remains tedious and time-consuming. We propose Herb.jl, a unifying program synthesis library written in Julia, to address these issues. Since current methods share similar building blocks, we aim to break down the underlying algorithms into extendable, reusable subcomponents. To demonstrate the benefits of using Herb.jl, we show how to implement a simple problem and grammar, and how to solve it with just a few lines of code.</p></details> |  |

However, understanding students' progress can be prohibitively difficult, particularly for multi-faceted problems that include multiple steps with complex interdependencies, have no predictable completion order, or involve evaluation criteria that are difficult to summarize across many students (e.g., exercises building interactive web-based user interfaces). We introduce SPARK, a coding exercise monitoring dashboard designed to address these challenges. SPARK allows instructors to flexibly group substeps into checkpoints based on exercise requirements, suggests automated tests for these checkpoints, and generates visualizations to track progress across steps. SPARK also allows instructors to inspect intermediate outputs, providing deeper insights into solution variations. We also construct a dataset of 40-minute keystroke coding data from N=22 learners solving two web programming exercises and provide empirical insights into the perceived usefulness of SPARK through a within-subjects evaluation with 16 programming instructors.</p></details> |  |

However, their integration into neural networks is challenging as they are piecewise constant, yielding gradients that are zero almost everywhere. In this paper, we propose a unified framework casting these operators as dynamic programs, and derive differentiable relaxations by smoothing the underlying recursions. On the algorithmic side, we develop efficient parallel algorithms supporting both deterministic and stochastic forward passes, and vector-Jacobian products for the backward pass. On the theoretical side, we prove that Shannon entropy is the unique regularization choice yielding permutation-equivariant operators, and characterize regularizers inducing sparse selections. Finally, on the experimental side, we demonstrate our framework on a decision-focused learning benchmark, a constrained dynamic assortment RL problem, and an extension of discrete VAEs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-objective Integer Linear Programming approach for Automatic Software Cognitive Complexity Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21565v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clear and concise code is necessary to ensure maintainability, so it is crucial that the software is as simple as possible to understand, to avoid bugs and, above all, vulnerabilities. There are many ways to enhance software without changing its functionality, considering the extract method refactoring the primary process to reduce the effort required for code comprehension. The cognitive complexity measure employed in this work is the one defined by SonarSource, which is a company that develops well-known applications for static code analysis. This extraction problem can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem. The main difficulty arises from the existence of different criteria for evaluating the solutions obtained, requiring the formulation of the code extraction problem as a multi-objective optimization problem using alternative methods. We propose a multi-objective integer linear programming model to obtain a set of solutions that reduce the cognitive complexity of a given piece of code, such as balancing the number of lines of code and its cognitive complexity. In addition, several algorithms have been developed to validate the model. These algorithms have been integrated into a tool that enables the parameterised resolution of the problem of reducing software cognitive complexity.</p></details> | 51 pages, 17 figures |

We report the existence of input-dependent OOBs in the wild that manifest only under specific inputs. All existing tools to detect OOBs in GPU programs rely on runtime techniques that require an OOB to manifest for detection. Thus, input-dependent OOBs elude them. We also discover intra-allocation OOBs that arise in the presence of logical partitioning of a memory allocation into multiple data structures. Existing techniques are oblivious to the possibility of such OOBs. We make a key observation that the presence (or absence) of semantic relations among program variables, which determines the size of allocations (CPU code) and those calculating offsets into memory allocations (GPU code), helps identify the absence (or presence) of OOBs. We build SCuBA, a first-of-its-kind compile-time technique that analyzes CPU and GPU code to capture such semantic relations (if present). It uses a SAT solver to check if an OOB access is possible under any input, given the captured relations expressed as constraints. It further analyzes GPU code to track logical partitioning of memory allocations for detecting intra-allocation OOB. Compared to NVIDIA's Compute Sanitizer that misses 45 elusive memory bugs across 20 programs, SCuBA misses none with no false alarms.</p></details> |  |

Turing's foundational result established the Halting Problem as undecidable, showing that no algorithm can universally determine termination for all programs and inputs. Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases. We hope these insights motivate further research into program termination and the broader potential of LLMs for reasoning about undecidable problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Abstain and Validate: A Dual-LLM Policy for Reducing Noise in Agentic Program Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03217v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic Automated Program Repair (APR) is increasingly tackling complex, repository-level bugs in industry, but ultimately these patches still need to be reviewed by a human before committing them to ensure they address the bug. Showing patches unlikely to be accepted can lead to substantial noise, wasting valuable developer time and eroding trust in automated code changes. We introduce two complementary LLM-based policies to reduce such noise: bug abstention and patch validation policies. Bug abstention excludes bugs that the agentic APR system is unlikely to fix. Patch validation rejects patches that are unlikely to be a good fix for the given bug. We evaluate both policies on three sets of bugs from Google's codebase, and their candidate patches generated by an internal agentic APR system. On a set of 174 human-reported bugs, removing bugs and patches rejected by our policies can raise success rates by up to 13 percentage points and 15 percentage points, respectively, and by up to 39 percentage points in combination. On null pointer exceptions and sanitizer-reported bugs with machine-generated bug reports, patch validation also improves average single-sample success rates. This two-policy approach provides a practical path to the reliable, industrial-scale deployment of agentic APR systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2026 IEEE/ACM 48th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice (ICSE-SEIP '26)</p></details> |

| **[Hexcute: A Compiler Framework for Automating Layout Synthesis in GPU Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16214v3)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient GPU programming is crucial for achieving high performance in deep learning (DL) applications. The performance of GPU programs depends on how data is parallelized across threads and arranged within memory subsystems. The mapping functions describing tensors on GPUs are known as \emph{tensor layouts}. Low-level programming frameworks, such as CUTLASS and Hidet, provide expressive layout abstractions but often require \emph{considerable programming effort} to manually specify optimal layouts. High-level GPU programming languages, such as Triton, rely on compiler heuristics to generate dataflow, layouts, and pipelining strategies in GPU programs. However, the heuristics for dataflow and pipelining strategies are not generalizable to complex operators. To balance expressiveness and programmability, we propose Hexcute, a compiler framework that automates layout synthesis while providing explicit control over dataflow and pipelining. Hexcute formalizes layout synthesis as a constraint programming problem and solves it with a type-inference-based algorithm. This approach enables systematic exploration of optimal layouts and instructions. Our evaluation shows that Hexcute matches the performance of libraries like cuBLAS and FlashAttention on GEMM, Attention, and their variants, while reducing the amount of code by 1.27$\times$-7.94$\times$ compared to CUTLASS. For mixed-type mixture-of-experts (MoE) operators, Hexcute achieves an average speedup of 6.46$\times$ over Triton. In the end-to-end evaluations of vLLM, Hexcute delivers up to 2.60$\times$ speedup on DeepSeek-R1-AWQ and 2.04$\times$ on a Mamba-based model.</p></details> | 19 pages, 27 figures |

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by integrating external knowledge, yet retrieval models often miss relevant context, and generation models hallucinate with irrelevant data. We propose Programming Knowledge Graph (PKG) for semantic representation and fine-grained retrieval of code and text. Our approach enhances retrieval precision through tree pruning and mitigates hallucinations via a re-ranking mechanism that integrates non-RAG solutions. Structuring external data into finer-grained nodes improves retrieval granularity. Evaluations on HumanEval and MBPP show up to 20% pass@1 accuracy gains and a 34% improvement over baselines on MBPP. Our findings demonstrate that our proposed PKG approach along with re-ranker effectively address complex problems while maintaining minimal negative impact on solutions that are already correct without RAG.

| **[Analysis of approximate linear programming solution to Markov decision problem with log barrier function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19800v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are two primary approaches to solving Markov decision problems (MDPs): dynamic programming based on the Bellman equation and linear programming (LP). Dynamic programming methods are the most widely used and form the foundation of both classical and modern reinforcement learning (RL). By contrast, LP-based methods have been less commonly employed, although they have recently gained attention in contexts such as offline RL. The relative underuse of the LP-based methods stems from the fact that it leads to an inequality-constrained optimization problem, which is generally more challenging to solve effectively compared with Bellman-equation-based methods. The purpose of this paper is to establish a theoretical foundation for solving LP-based MDPs in a more effective and practical manner. Our key idea is to leverage the log-barrier function, widely used in inequality-constrained optimization, to transform the LP formulation of the MDP into an unconstrained optimization problem. This reformulation enables approximate solutions to be obtained easily via gradient descent. While the method may appear simple, to the best of our knowledge, a thorough theoretical interpretation of this approach has not yet been developed. This paper aims to bridge this gap.</p></details> |  |

A central challenge is to maintain scalability when dealing with fine-grained timing constraints, which can significantly exacerbate ASP's grounding bottleneck. To address this issue, we leverage extensions of ASP with difference constraints, a simplified form of linear constraints, to handle time-related aspects externally. Our approach effectively decouples metric ASP from the granularity of time, resulting in a solution that is unaffected by time precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Types for Grassroots Logic Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17957v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grassroots Logic Programs (GLP) is a concurrent logic programming language in which logic variables are partitioned into paired readers and writers. An assignment is produced at most once via a writer and consumed at most once via its paired reader, and may contain additional readers and/or writers. This enables the concise expression of rich multidirectional communication modalities. ``Logic Programs as Types for Logic Programs'' (LICS'91) defined types as regular sets of paths over derivable ground atoms. Here, we define types to be regular sets of moded paths, where a mode captures directionality of communication -- whether a subterm is consumed from or produced to the environment -- enabling the typing of interactive partial computations including those that eventually deadlock or fail, or never terminate. We provide a syntactic definition of well-typing and prove that a program is well-typed iff the path abstraction of its moded-atom semantics satisfies covariance and contravariance conditions with respect to its type. The GLP type system was implemented in Dart by AI, starting from a mathematical specification of Typed GLP (this paper), deriving from it an English spec (written by AI), and from the spec deriving Dart code (by AI). While GLP is naturally untyped, the motivation for Typed GLP comes from programming with AI: Asking AI to program complex communication modalities in GLP (and in general) and hoping for the best is a tenuous strategy. The emerging discipline we advocate and employ is for the human designer and AI to jointly develop and agree upon (1)~GLP types; (2)~GLP procedure type declarations; (3)~informal (English) descriptions of the procedures; and only then let AI attempt to write (4)~GLP code based on those.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact Graph Learning via Integer Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20589v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning the dependence structure among variables in complex systems is a central problem across medical, natural, and social sciences. These structures can be naturally represented by graphs, and the task of inferring such graphs from data is known as graph learning or as causal discovery if the graphs are given a causal interpretation. Existing approaches typically rely on restrictive assumptions about the data-generating process, employ greedy oracle algorithms, or solve approximate formulations of the graph learning problem. As a result, they are either sensitive to violations of central assumptions or fail to guarantee globally optimal solutions. We address these limitations by introducing a nonparametric graph learning framework based on nonparametric conditional independence testing and integer programming. We reformulate the graph learning problem as an integer-programming problem and prove that solving the integer-programming problem provides a globally optimal solution to the original graph learning problem. Our method leverages efficient encodings of graphical separation criteria, enabling the exact recovery of larger graphs than was previously feasible. We provide an implementation in the openly available R package 'glip' which supports learning (acyclic) directed (mixed) graphs and chain graphs. From the resulting output one can compute representations of the corresponding Markov equivalence classes or weak equivalence classes. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach is faster than other existing exact graph learning procedures for a large fraction of instances and graphs of various sizes. GLIP also achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated data and benchmark datasets across all aforementioned classes of graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Program Logic for Abstract (Hyper)Properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20370v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce APPL (Abstract Program Property Logic), a unifying Hoare-style logic that subsumes standard Hoare logic, incorrectness logic, and several variants of Hyper Hoare logic. APPL provides a principled foundation for abstract program logics parameterised by an abstract domain, encompassing both existing and novel abstractions of properties and hyperproperties. The logic is grounded in a semantic framework where the meaning of commands is first defined on a lattice basis and then extended to the full lattice via additivity. Crucially, nondeterministic choice is interpreted by a monoidal operator that need not be idempotent nor coincide with the lattice join. This flexibility allows the framework to capture collecting semantics, various classes of abstract semantics, and hypersemantics. The APPL proof system is sound, and it is relatively complete whenever the property language is sufficiently expressive. When the property language is restricted to an abstract domain, the result is a sound abstract deduction system based on best correct approximations. Relative completeness with respect to a corresponding abstract semantics is recovered provided the abstract domain is complete, in the sense of abstract interpretation, for the monoidal operator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Streaming Tensor Programs: A Streaming Abstraction for Dynamic Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07776v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic behaviors are becoming prevalent in tensor applications, like machine learning, where many widely used models contain data-dependent tensor shapes and control flow. However, the limited expressiveness of prior programming abstractions for spatial dataflow accelerators (SDAs) forces these dynamic behaviors to be implemented statically and/or unoptimized. To address these challenges, we present Streaming Tensor Programs (STeP), a streaming abstraction that enables dynamic tensor workloads to run efficiently on SDAs. STeP introduces flexible routing operators, an explicit memory hierarchy, and symbolic-shape semantics that expose dynamic data rates and tensor dimensions. These capabilities unlock new optimizations, like dynamic tiling, dynamic parallelization, and configuration time-multiplexing, that adapt SDA execution to dynamic behaviors while preserving dataflow efficiency. Using a cycle-approximate simulator on representative LLM layers and a full model with real-world traces, STeP enables: dynamic tiling that breaks the Pareto-optimal frontier from prior work, dynamic parallelization that improves latency by ~2.72x, and configuration time-multiplexing that increases compute utilization by ~2.64x over prior SDA abstractions and their implementations.</p></details> |  |

We present CodePilot, a hybrid framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with large language models to enable execution-guided program repair for real-world GitHub issues. CodePilot performs hierarchical fault localization from repository to file and function level, explores diverse patch trajectories using MCTS, and leverages execution feedback as a reward signal to guide search and refinement. The framework further incorporates confidence-calibrated generation to selectively refine low-confidence outputs. Experiments on SWE-bench Lite demonstrate that CodePilot achieves a 24.67% issue resolution rate using open-weight models, outperforming comparable baselines. These results suggest that combining symbolic search with neural language models is an effective strategy for scalable, execution-aware software engineering automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Rule-Based Graph Programs Matching the Time Complexity of Imperative Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09144v4)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report on recent advances in rule-based graph programming, which allow us to match the time complexity of some fundamental imperative graph algorithms. In general, achieving the time complexity of graph algorithms implemented in conventional languages using a rule-based graph-transformation language is challenging due to the cost of graph matching. Previous work demonstrated that with rooted rules, certain algorithms can be implemented in the graph programming language GP 2 such that their runtime matches the time complexity of imperative implementations. However, this required input graphs to have a bounded node degree and (for some algorithms) to be connected. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by enhancing the graph data structure generated by the GP 2 compiler and exploiting the new structure in programs. We present three case studies: the first program checks whether input graphs are connected, the second program checks whether input graphs are acyclic, and the third program solves the single-source shortest-paths problem for graphs with integer edge-weights. The first two programs run in linear time on (possibly disconnected) input graphs with arbitrary node degrees. The third program runs in time $O(nm)$ on arbitrary input graphs, matching the time complexity of imperative implementations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. For each program, we formally prove its correctness and time complexity, and provide runtime experiments on various graph classes.</p></details> | LMCS |

Traditional static analysis tools often fail in these scenarios due to their reliance on successful compilation, while Large Language Models (LLMs) lack the structural context necessary to reason about complex program logic. We introduce ATLAS, a Python-based Command-Line Interface (CLI). It is characterized by: (i) inter-procedural, type-aware analysis that captures dependencies across function boundaries; (ii) support for both full-project and partial analysis of non-compilable projects; (iii) graph optimizations, such as variable collapsing and node blacklisting; and (iv) synchronized multi-view graphs that align syntax, execution paths, and data-flow logic. Evaluating ATLAS with DeepSeek V3.2 for automated test generation demonstrates a 34.71% increase in line coverage and 32.66% in branch coverage, achieving performance on par with and even exceeding the industry-standard symbolic execution tool KLEE on complex projects. With polynomial scalability, ATLAS provides a robust infrastructure for generating the information-dense datasets required by next-generation, graph-aware Machine Learning for Software Engineering (ML4SE) models.

| **[Dynamic Cogeneration of Bug Reproduction Test in Agentic Program Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.19066v1)** | 2026-01-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug Reproduction Tests (BRTs) have been used in many agentic Automated Program Repair (APR) systems, primarily for validating promising fixes and aiding fix generation. In practice, when developers submit a patch, they often implement the BRT alongside the fix. Our experience deploying agentic APR reveals that developers similarly desire a BRT within AI-generated patches to increase their confidence. However, canonical APR systems tend to generate BRTs and fixes separately, or focus on producing only the fix in the final patch. In this paper, we study agentic APR in the context of cogeneration, where the APR agent is instructed to generate both a fix and a BRT in the same patch. We evaluate the effectiveness of different cogeneration strategies on 120 human-reported bugs at Google and characterize different cogeneration strategies by their influence on APR agent behavior. We develop and evaluate patch selectors that account for test change information to select patches with plausible fixes (and plausible BRTs). Finally, we analyze the root causes of failed cogeneration trajectories. Importantly, we show that cogeneration allows the APR agent to generate BRTs for at least as many bugs as a dedicated BRT agent, without compromising the generation rate of plausible fixes, thereby reducing engineering effort in maintaining and coordinating separate generation pipelines for fix and BRT at scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symmetric Proofs of Parameterized Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18745v1)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the problem of safety verification of infinite-state parameterized programs that are formed based on a rich class of topologies. We introduce a new proof system, called parametric proof spaces, which exploits the underlying symmetry in such programs. This is a local notion of symmetry which enables the proof system to reuse proof arguments for isomorphic neighbourhoods in program topologies. We prove a sophisticated relative completeness result for the proof system with respect to a class of universally quantified invariants. We also investigate the problem of algorithmic construction of these proofs. We present a construction, inspired by classic results in model theory, where an infinitary limit program can be soundly and completely verified in place of the parameterized family, under some conditions. Furthermore, we demonstrate how these proofs can be constructed and checked against these programs without the need for axiomatization of the underlying topology for proofs or the programs. Finally, we present conditions under which our algorithm becomes a decision procedure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integer Linear Programming Preprocessing for Maximum Satisfiability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06216v3)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Maximum Satisfiability problem (MaxSAT) is a major optimization challenge with numerous practical applications. In recent MaxSAT evaluations, most MaxSAT solvers have incorporated an Integer Linear Programming (ILP) solver into their portfolios. However, a good portfolio strategy requires a lot of tuning work and is limited to the profiling benchmark. This paper proposes a methodology to fully integrate ILP preprocessing techniques into the MaxSAT solving pipeline and investigates the impact on the top-performing MaxSAT solvers. Experimental results show that our approach helps to improve 5 out of 6 state-of-the-art MaxSAT solvers, especially for WMaxCDCL-OpenWbo1200, the winner of the MaxSAT evaluation 2024 on the unweighted track, which is able to solve 15 additional instances using our methodology.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interleaving Natural Language Prompting with Code Editing for Solving Programming Tasks with Generative AI Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14088v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern computing students often rely on both natural-language prompting and manual code editing to solve programming tasks. Yet we still lack a clear understanding of how these two modes are combined in practice, and how their usage varies with task complexity and student ability. In this paper, we investigate this through a large-scale study in an introductory programming course, collecting 13,305 interactions from 355 students during a three-day lab activity. Our analysis shows that students primarily use prompting to generate initial solutions, and then often enter short edit-run loops to refine their code following a failed execution. Student reflections confirm that prompting is helpful for structuring solutions, editing is effective for making targeted corrections, while both are useful for learning. We find that manual editing becomes more frequent as task complexity increases, but most edits remain concise, with many affecting a single line of code. Higher-performing students tend to succeed using prompting alone, while lower-performing students rely more on edits. These findings highlight the role of manual editing as a deliberate last-mile repair strategy, complementing prompting in AI-assisted programming workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Closing the Loop: An Instructor-in-the-Loop AI Assistance System for Supporting Student Help-Seeking in Programming Education](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14457v3)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Timely and high-quality feedback is essential for effective learning in programming courses; yet, providing such support at scale remains a challenge. While AI-based systems offer scalable and immediate help, their responses can occasionally be inaccurate or insufficient. Human instructors, in contrast, may bring more valuable expertise but are limited in time and availability. To address these limitations, we present a hybrid help framework that integrates AI-generated hints with an escalation mechanism, allowing students to request feedback from instructors when AI support falls short. This design leverages the strengths of AI for scale and responsiveness while reserving instructor effort for moments of greatest need. We deployed this tool in a data science programming course with 82 students. We observe that out of the total 673 AI-generated hints, students rated 146 (22%) as unhelpful. Among those, only 16 (11%) of the cases were escalated to the instructors. A qualitative investigation of instructor responses showed that those feedback instances were incorrect or insufficient roughly half of the time. This finding suggests that when AI support fails, even instructors with expertise may need to pay greater attention to avoid making mistakes. We will publicly release the tool for broader adoption and enable further studies in other classrooms. Our work contributes a practical approach to scaling high-quality support and informs future efforts to effectively integrate AI and humans in education.</p></details> | SIGCSE'26 paper |
| **[Adversarial Bug Reports as a Security Risk in Language Model-Based Automated Program Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05372v2)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) - based Automated Program Repair (APR) systems are increasingly integrated into modern software development workflows, offering automated patches in response to natural language bug reports. However, this reliance on untrusted user input introduces a novel and underexplored attack surface. In this paper, we investigate the security risks posed by adversarial bug reports -- realistic-looking issue submissions crafted to mislead APR systems into producing insecure or harmful code changes. We develop a comprehensive threat model and conduct an empirical study to evaluate the vulnerability of APR systems to such attacks. Our demonstration comprises 51 adversarial bug reports generated across a spectrum of strategies, ranging from manual curation to fully automated pipelines. We test these against a leading LLM-based APR system and assess both pre-repair defenses (e.g., LlamaGuard variants, PromptGuard variants, Granite-Guardian, and custom LLM filters) and post-repair detectors (GitHub Copilot, CodeQL). Our findings show that current defenses are insufficient: 90% of crafted bug reports triggered attacker-aligned patches. The best pre-repair filter blocked only 47%, while post-repair analysis -- often requiring human oversight -- was effective in just 58% of cases. To support scalable security testing, we introduce a prototype framework for automating the generation of adversarial bug reports. Our analysis exposes a structural asymmetry: generating adversarial inputs is inexpensive, while detecting or mitigating them remains costly and error-prone. We conclude with recommendations for improving the robustness of APR systems against adversarial misuse and highlight directions for future work on secure APR.</p></details> |  |
| **[VideoPro: Adaptive Program Reasoning for Long Video Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17743v4)** | 2026-01-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating program workflows for visual tasks. However, previous approaches often rely on closed-source models, lack systematic reasoning, and struggle with long-form video question answering (videoQA). To address these challenges, we introduce the FS-VisPR framework, an adaptive visual program reasoning approach that balances fast reasoning for simple queries with slow reasoning for difficult ones. First, we design efficient visual modules (e.g., key clip retrieval and subtitle retrieval) to support long-form video tasks. Then, we construct a diverse and high-quality fast-slow reasoning dataset with a strong LLM to align open-source language models' ability to generate visual program workflows as FS-LLM. Next, we design a fast-slow reasoning framework with FS-LLM: Simple queries are directly solved by VideoLLMs, while difficult ones invoke visual program reasoning, motivated by human-like reasoning processes. During this process, low-confidence fast-thinking answers will trigger a second-stage slow-reasoning process, and a fallback mechanism to fast reasoning is activated if the program execution fails. Moreover, we improve visual programs through parameter search during both training and inference. By adjusting the parameters of the visual modules within the program, multiple variants are generated: during training, programs that yield correct answers are selected, while during inference, the program with the highest confidence result is applied. Experiments show that FS-VisPR improves both efficiency and reliability in visual program workflows. It achieves 50.4% accuracy on LVBench, surpassing GPT-4o, matching the performance of Qwen2.5VL-72B on VideoMME.</p></details> |  |
| **[TabularMath: Evaluating Computational Extrapolation in Tabular Learning via Program-Verified Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02523v1)** | 2026-01-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Standard tabular benchmarks mainly focus on the evaluation of a model's capability to interpolate values inside a data manifold, where models good at performing local statistical smoothing are rewarded. However, there exists a very large category of high-value tabular data, including financial modeling and physical simulations, which are generated based upon deterministic computational processes, as opposed to stochastic and noisy relationships. Therefore, we investigate if tabular models can provide an extension from statistical interpolation to computational extrapolation. We propose TabularMath, a diagnostic benchmark of 114 deterministic problems (233,472 rows) generated from verified programs based on GSM8K and AIME. We evaluate 9 tabular architectures and in-context learning (ICL) with GPT-OSS-120B. On standard regression metrics, TabPFN v2.5 performs remarkably well, achieving R^2=0.998 in-distribution and maintaining positive R^2 even under distribution shift, which is unique among the tabular models we tested. When we measure rounded consistency (exact integer match), a different picture emerges: TabPFN v2.5 drops below 10% on out-of-distribution data, while ICL maintains around 40%. This gap between R^2 and exact-match accuracy suggests that tabular models learn smooth function approximations but struggle to recover precise computational outputs under extrapolation. The two paradigms appear complementary: TabPFN scales efficiently with data; ICL achieves exact computation from few examples. We release all code and data to support further investigation.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages; TabularMath technical report</p></details> |

In realistic project-level repair scenarios, software repositories often span millions of tokens, far exceeding current LLM context limits. Consequently, models must first identify a small, relevant subset of code, making accurate FL essential for effective repair. We present a novel project-level FL approach that improves both file- and element-level localization. Our method introduces a hierarchical reasoning module that (i) generates structured, bug-specific explanations for candidate files and elements, and (ii) leverages these explanations in a two-stage ranking scheme combining LLM-based and embedding-based signals. We further propose a counterfactual upper-bound analysis to quantify the contribution of each localization stage to repair success. We evaluate our approach on Python and Java projects from SWE-bench Verified, Lite, and Java. Compared to state-of-the-art baselines, including Agentless and OpenHands, our method consistently improves localization accuracy. On SWE-bench Verified, file-level Hit@1 improves from 71.4% to 85%, and MRR from 81.8% to 88.8%. At the element level, Exact Match under top-3 files increases from 36% to 69%. Integrating our localization into Agentless yields a 12.8% end-to-end repair success improvement.</p></details> | 23 pages, 5 figures |

This subarea of program analysis is challenging due to the existence of undecidable problems, and this Survey systematically explores approaches that mitigate this inherent difficulty. These include foundational decidability results, the use of ranking functions, and disjunctive well-founded transition invariants. The Survey also discusses non-termination witnesses, used to prove that a program will not halt. We examine the algorithmic and complexity aspects of these methods, showing how different approaches offer a trade-off between expressive power and computational complexity. The Survey does not discuss how termination analysis is performed on real-world programming languages, nor does it consider more expressive abstract models that include non-linear arithmetic, probabilistic choice, or term rewriting systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final version for FNT-PL</p></details> |

By leveraging PyOPL, an OPL-like AML compiler that provides detailed syntax diagnostics, we introduce SyntAGM, an end-to-end system that translates natural language problem descriptions into PyOPL models via a generate--compile--assess--revise loop. SyntAGM is grammar-aware thanks to in-context exposure to the PyOPL BNF grammar, and benefits from few-shot retrieval of literate PyOPL model exemplars. To obtain a valid PyOPL model that matches the problem description, SyntAGM mobilises compiler feedback and an LLM-based alignment judge. In a comparative study against established prompting baselines SyntAGM achieves competitive accuracy with superior token, cost, and latency profiles.</p></details> | 18 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Human-Aligned Enhancement of Programming Answers with LLMs Guided by User Feedback](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17604v1)** | 2026-01-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used to support software developers in tasks such as code generation, optimization, and documentation. However, their ability to improve existing programming answers in a human-like manner remains underexplored. On technical question-and-answer platforms such as Stack Overflow (SO), contributors often revise answers based on user comments that identify errors, inefficiencies, or missing explanations. Yet roughly one-third of this feedback is never addressed due to limited time, expertise, or visibility, leaving many answers incomplete or outdated. This study investigates whether LLMs can enhance programming answers by interpreting and incorporating comment-based feedback. We make four main contributions. First, we introduce ReSOlve, a benchmark consisting of 790 SO answers with associated comment threads, annotated for improvement-related and general feedback. Second, we evaluate four state-of-the-art LLMs on their ability to identify actionable concerns, finding that DeepSeek achieves the best balance between precision and recall. Third, we present AUTOCOMBAT, an LLM-powered tool that improves programming answers by jointly leveraging user comments and question context. Compared to human revised references, AUTOCOMBAT produces near-human quality improvements while preserving the original intent and significantly outperforming the baseline. Finally, a user study with 58 practitioners shows strong practical value, with 84.5 percent indicating they would adopt or recommend the tool. Overall, AUTOCOMBAT demonstrates the potential of scalable, feedback-driven answer refinement to improve the reliability and trustworthiness of technical knowledge platforms.</p></details> | Preprint |

This study presents an empirical analysis of developing a 7420 line Terminal User Interface framework for the Ring programming language, completed in roughly ten hours of active work spread across three days using a purely prompt driven workflow with Claude Code, Opus 4.5. The system was produced through 107 prompts: 21 feature requests, 72 bug fix prompts, 9 prompts sharing information from Ring documentation, 4 prompts providing architectural guidance, and 1 prompt dedicated to generating documentation. Development progressed across five phases, with the Window Manager phase requiring the most interaction, followed by complex UI systems and controls expansion. Bug related prompts covered redraw issues, event handling faults, runtime errors, and layout inconsistencies, while feature requests focused primarily on new widgets, window manager capabilities, and advanced UI components. Most prompts were short, reflecting a highly iterative workflow in which the human role was limited to specifying requirements, validating behaviour, and issuing corrective prompts without writing any code manually. The resulting framework includes a complete windowing subsystem, event driven architecture, interactive widgets, hierarchical menus, grid and tree components, tab controls, and a multi window desktop environment. By combining quantitative prompt analysis with qualitative assessment of model behaviour, this study provides empirical evidence that modern LLMs can sustain architectural coherence and support the construction of production grade tooling for emerging programming languages, highlighting prompt driven development as a viable methodology within software engineering practice.</p></details> |  |

It enables cache-coherent, shared memory pools in a disaggregated fashion at unprecedented scales, allowing algorithms to interact with various storage devices using simple loads and stores. While CXL unleashes unique opportunities, it also introduces challenges of data management and crash consistency. For example, CXL currently lacks an adequate programming model, making it impossible to reason about the correctness and behavior of systems on top. In this work, we present CXL0, the first programming model for concurrent programs over CXL. We propose a high-level abstraction for memory accesses and formally define operational semantics. We demonstrate that CXL0 captures a wide range of current and future CXL setups and perform initial measurements on real hardware. To illustrate the usefulness of CXL0, we present a general transformation that enhances any linearizable concurrent algorithm with durability in a distributed partial-crash setting. We believe that this work will serve as a stepping stone for systems design and programming on top of CXL.</p></details> |  |
| **[Expectation-based Analysis of Higher-Order Quantum Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18441v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The paper extends the expectation transformer based analysis of higher-order probabilistic programs to the quantum higher-order setting. The quantum language we are considering can be seen as an extension of PCF, featuring unbounded recursion. The language admits classical and quantum data, as well as a tick operator to account for costs. Our quantum expectation transformer translates such programs into a functional, non-quantum language, enriched with a type and operations over so called cost-structures. By specializing the cost-structure, this methodology makes it possible to study several expectation based properties of quantum programs, such as average case cost, probabilities of events or expected values, in terms of the translated non-quantum programs, this way enabling classical reasoning techniques. As a show-case, we adapt a refinement type system, capable of reasoning on upper-bounds.</p></details> |  |
| **[From LLMs to Agents in Programming: The Impact of Providing an LLM with a Compiler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12146v2)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models have demonstrated a remarkable capability in natural language and program generation and software development. However, the source code generated by the LLMs does not always meet quality requirements and may fail to compile. Therefore, many studies evolve into agents that can reason about the problem before generating the source code for the solution. The goal of this paper is to study the degree to which such agents benefit from access to software development tools, in our case, a gcc compiler. We conduct a computational experiment on the RosettaCode dataset, on 699 programming tasks in C. We evaluate how the integration with a compiler shifts the role of the language model from a passive generator to an active agent capable of iteratively developing runnable programs based on feedback from the compiler. We evaluated 16 language models with sizes ranging from small (135 million) to medium (3 billion) and large (70 billion). Our results show that access to a compiler improved the compilation success by 5.3 to 79.4 percentage units in compilation without affecting the semantics of the generated program. Syntax errors dropped by 75%, and errors related to undefined references dropped by 87% for the tasks where the agents outperformed the baselines. We also observed that in some cases, smaller models with a compiler outperform larger models with a compiler. We conclude that it is essential for LLMs to have access to software engineering tools to enhance their performance and reduce the need for large models in software engineering, such as reducing our energy footprint.</p></details> |  |

The challenge is searching vast hypothesis spaces, which is exacerbated because many logically equivalent hypotheses exist. To address this challenge, we introduce a method to break symmetries in the hypothesis space. We implement our idea in answer set programming. Our experiments on multiple domains, including visual reasoning and game playing, show that our approach can reduce solving times from over an hour to just 17 seconds.</p></details> | AAAI26 |
| **[Learning to Optimize by Differentiable Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16510v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving massive-scale optimization problems requires scalable first-order methods with low per-iteration cost. This tutorial highlights a shift in optimization: using differentiable programming not only to execute algorithms but to learn how to design them. Modern frameworks such as PyTorch, TensorFlow, and JAX enable this paradigm through efficient automatic differentiation. Embedding first-order methods within these systems allows end-to-end training that improves convergence and solution quality. Guided by Fenchel-Rockafellar duality, the tutorial demonstrates how duality-informed iterative schemes such as ADMM and PDHG can be learned and adapted. Case studies across LP, OPF, Laplacian regularization, and neural network verification illustrate these gains.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring the Role of Automated Feedback in Programming Education: A Systematic Literature Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.00089v1)** | 2026-01-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated feedback systems have become increasingly integral to programming education, where learners engage in iterative cycles of code construction, testing, and refinement. Despite its wider integration in practices and technical advancements into AI, research in this area remains fragmented, lacking synthesis across technological and instructional dimensions. This systematic literature review synthesizes 61 empirical studies published by September 2024, offering a conceptually grounded analysis of automated feedback systems across five dimensions: system architecture, pedagogical function, interaction mechanism, contextual deployment, and evaluation approach. Findings reveal that most systems are fully automated, embedded within online platforms, and primarily focused on error detection and code correctness. While recent developments incorporate adaptive features and large language models to enable more personalized and interactive feedback, few systems offer support for higher-order learning processes, interactive components, or learner agency. Moreover, evaluation practices tend to emphasize short-term performance gains, with limited attention to long-term outcomes or instructional integration. These findings call for a reimagining of automated feedback not as a technical add-on for error correction, but as a pedagogical scaffold that supports deeper, adaptive, and interactive learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integer programs with nearly totally unimodular matrices: the cographic case](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09477v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is a notorious open question whether integer programs (IPs), with an integer coefficient matrix $M$ whose subdeterminants are all bounded by a constant $Δ$ in absolute value, can be solved in polynomial time. We answer this question in the affirmative if we further require that, by removing a constant number of rows and columns from $M$, one obtains a submatrix $A$ that is the transpose of a network matrix. Our approach focuses on the case where $A$ arises from $M$ after removing $k$ rows only, where $k$ is a constant. We achieve our result in two main steps, the first related to the theory of IPs and the second related to graph minor theory. First, we derive a strong proximity result for the case where $A$ is a general totally unimodular matrix: Given an optimal solution of the linear programming relaxation, an optimal solution to the IP can be obtained by finding a constant number of augmentations by circuits of $[A\; I]$. Second, for the case where $A$ is transpose of a network matrix, we reformulate the problem as a maximum constrained integer potential problem on a graph $G$. We observe that if $G$ is $2$-connected, then it has no rooted $K_{2,t}$-minor for $t = Ω(k Δ)$. We leverage this to obtain a tree-decomposition of $G$ into highly structured graphs for which we can solve the problem locally. This allows us to solve the global problem via dynamic programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: r...</summary><p>v2: revised following the referees' comments</p></details> |
| **[Designing faster mixed integer linear programming algorithm via learning the optimal path](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.16056v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing faster algorithms for solving Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) problems is highly desired across numerous practical domains, as a vast array of complex real-world challenges can be effectively modeled as MILP formulations. Solving these problems typically employs the branch-and-bound algorithm, the core of which can be conceived as searching for a path of nodes (or sub-problems) that contains the optimal solution to the original MILP problem. Traditional approaches to finding this path rely heavily on hand-crafted, intuition-based heuristic strategies, which often suffer from unstable and unpredictable performance across different MILP problem instances. To address this limitation, we introduce DeepBound, a deep learning-based node selection algorithm that automates the learning of such human intuition from data. The core of DeepBound lies in learning to prioritize nodes containing the optimal solution, thereby improving solving efficiency. DeepBound introduces a multi-level feature fusion network to capture the node representations. To tackle the inherent node imbalance in branch-and-bound trees, DeepBound employs a pairwise training paradigm that enhances the model's ability to discriminate between nodes. Extensive experiments on three NP-hard MILP benchmarks demonstrate that DeepBound achieves superior solving efficiency over conventional heuristic rules and existing learning-based approaches, obtaining optimal feasible solutions with significantly reduced computation time. Moreover, DeepBound demonstrates strong generalization capability on large and complex instances. The analysis of its learned features reveals that the method can automatically discover more flexible and robust feature selection, which may effectively improve and potentially replace human-designed heuristic rules.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dependently-Typed AARA: A Non-Affine Approach for Resource Analysis of Higher-Order Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.12943v2)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static resource analysis determines the resource consumption (e.g., time complexity) of a program without executing it. Among the numerous existing approaches for resource analysis, affine type systems have been one dominant approach. However, these affine type systems fall short of deriving precise resource behavior of higher-order programs, particularly in cases that involve partial applications. This article presents λ_\ms{amor}^\ms{na}}, a non-affine AARA-style dependent type system for resource reasoning about higher-order functional programs. The key observation is that the main issue in previous approaches comes from (i) the close coupling of types and resources, and (ii) the conflict between affine and higher-order typing mechanisms. To derive precise resource behavior of higher-order functions, λ_\ms{amor}^\ms{na}} decouples resources from types and follows a non-affine typing mechanism. The non-affine type system of λ_\ms{amor}^\ms{na}} achieves this by using dependent types, which allows expressing type-level potential functions separate from ordinary types. This article formalizes λ_\ms{amor}^\ms{na}}'s syntax and semantics, and proves its soundness, which guarantees the correctness of resource bounds. Several challenging classic and higher-order examples are presented to demonstrate the expressiveness and compositionality of λ_\ms{amor}^\ms{na}}'s reasoning capability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unexpected but informative: What fixation-related potentials tell us about the processing of confusing program code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10099v3)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As software pervades more and more areas of our professional and personal lives, there is an ever-increasing need to maintain software and for programmers to efficiently write and understand program code. In the first study of its kind, we analyze fixation-related potentials (FRPs) to explore the online processing of program code patterns that are confusing to programmers, but not to the computer (so-called atoms of confusion), and their underlying neurocognitive mechanisms in an ecologically valid setting. Relative to clean counterparts in program code without an atom of confusion, confusing code elicits a late frontal positivity of about 400 to 700 ms after first looking at the atom of confusion. This frontal positivity resembles an event-related potential (ERP) component found during natural language processing that is elicited by unexpected but plausible words in sentence context. Thus, we suggest that the brain engages similar neurocognitive mechanisms in response to unexpected and informative inputs in program code and in natural language. In both domains, these inputs update a comprehender's situation model, which is essential for information extraction from a quickly unfolding input. Our results have far-reaching implications for programming and pave the way for interdisciplinary collaborations between software engineering and psycholinguistics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigation of the Generalisation Ability of Genetic Programming-evolved Scheduling Rules in Dynamic Flexible Job Shop Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.15717v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic Flexible Job Shop Scheduling (DFJSS) is a complex combinatorial optimisation problem that requires simultaneous machine assignment and operation sequencing decisions in dynamic production environments. Genetic Programming (GP) has been widely applied to automatically evolve scheduling rules for DFJSS. However, existing studies typically train and test GP-evolved rules on DFJSS instances of the same type, which differ only by random seeds rather than by structural characteristics, leaving their cross-type generalisation ability largely unexplored. To address this gap, this paper systematically investigates the generalisation ability of GP-evolved scheduling rules under diverse DFJSS conditions. A series of experiments are conducted across multiple dimensions, including problem scale (i.e., the number of machines and jobs), key job shop parameters (e.g., utilisation level), and data distributions, to analyse how these factors influence GP performance on unseen instance types. The results show that good generalisation occurs when the training instances contain more jobs than the test instances while keeping the number of machines fixed, and when both training and test instances have similar scales or job shop parameters. Further analysis reveals that the number and distribution of decision points in DFJSS instances play a crucial role in explaining these performance differences. Similar decision point distributions lead to better generalisation, whereas significant discrepancies result in a marked degradation of performance. Overall, this study provides new insights into the generalisation ability of GP in DFJSS and highlights the necessity of evolving more generalisable GP rules capable of handling heterogeneous DFJSS instances effectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning-augmented smooth integer programs with PAC-learnable oracles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02505v1)** | 2026-01-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates learning-augmented algorithms for smooth integer programs, covering canonical problems such as MAX-CUT and MAX-k-SAT. We introduce a framework that incorporates a predictive oracle to construct a linear surrogate of the objective, which is then solved via linear programming followed by a rounding procedure. Crucially, our framework ensures that the solution quality is both consistent and smooth against prediction errors. We demonstrate that this approach effectively extends tractable approximations from the classical dense regime to the near-dense regime. Furthermore, we go beyond the assumption of oracle existence by establishing its PAC-learnability. We prove that the induced algorithm class possesses a bounded pseudo-dimension, thereby ensuring that an oracle with near-optimal expected performance can be learned with polynomial samples.</p></details> |  |
| **[All for One and One for All: Program Logics for Exploiting Internal Determinism in Parallel Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23283v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nondeterminism makes parallel programs challenging to write and reason about. To avoid these challenges, researchers have developed techniques for internally deterministic parallel programming, in which the steps of a parallel computation proceed in a deterministic way. Internal determinism is useful because it lets a programmer reason about a program as if it executed in a sequential order. However, no verification framework exists to exploit this property and simplify formal reasoning about internally deterministic programs. To capture the essence of why internally deterministic programs should be easier to reason about, this paper defines a property called schedule-independent safety. A program satisfies schedule-independent safety, if, to show that the program is safe across all orderings, it suffices to show that one terminating execution of the program is safe. We then present a separation logic called Musketeer for proving that a program satisfies schedule-independent safety. Once a parallel program has been shown to satisfy schedule-independent safety, we can verify it with a new logic called Angelic, which allows one to dynamically select and verify just one sequential ordering of the program. Using Musketeer, we prove the soundness of MiniDet, an affine type system for enforcing internal determinism. MiniDet supports several core algorithmic primitives for internally deterministic programming that have been identified in the research literature, including a deterministic version of a concurrent hash set. Because any syntactically well-typed MiniDet program satisfies schedule-independent safety, we can apply Angelic to verify such programs. All results in this paper have been verified in Rocq using the Iris separation logic framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 26 figures, extended version of the same paper accepted at POPL 2026</p></details> |

DeGAS evaluates programs under a Gaussian-mixture semantics and replaces measure-zero predicates and discrete branches with a vanishing smoothing, yielding closed-form expressions for posterior and path probabilities. We prove differentiability of these quantities with respect to program parameters, enabling end-to-end optimization via standard automatic differentiation, without Monte Carlo estimators. On thirteen benchmark programs, DeGAS achieves accuracy and runtime competitive with variational inference and MCMC. Importantly, it reliably tackles optimization problems where sampling-based baselines fail to converge due to conditioning involving continuous variables.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Constraint Programming Model for the Super-Agile Earth Observation Satellite Imaging Scheduling Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11967v2)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the dependence on satellite imaging continues to grow, modern satellites have become increasingly agile, with the new generation, namely super-agile Earth observation satellites (SAEOS), providing unprecedented imaging flexibility. The highly dynamic capabilities of these satellites introduce additional challenges to the scheduling of observation tasks, as existing approaches for conventional agile satellites do not account for variable observation durations and multiple imaging directions. Although some efforts have been made in this regard, the SAEOS imaging scheduling problem (SAEOS-ISP) remains largely unexplored, and no exact approaches have yet been proposed. In this context, this study presents the first exact Constraint Programming formulation for the SAEOS-ISP, considering flexible observation windows, multiple pointing directions and sequence-dependent transition times across multiple satellites. Computational experiments on a newly generated benchmark set demonstrate that the model can be solved efficiently and within very short computational times. Moreover, the results also show that the proposed approach has the potential to achieve higher computational performance compared to the non-exact approaches that are currently considered state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, To be published in the Proceedings of the International Conference on Operations Research and Enterprise Systems (ICORES 2026)</p></details> |
| **[ICLF: An Immersive Code Learning Framework based on Git for Teaching and Evaluating Student Programming Projects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14814v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Programming projects are essential in computer science education for bridging theory with practice and introducing students to tools like Git, IDEs, and debuggers. However, designing and evaluating these projects (especially in MOOCs)can be challenging. We propose the Immersive Code Learning Framework (ICLF), a scalable Git-based organizational pipeline for managing and evaluating student programming project. Students begin with an existing code base, a practice that is crucial for mirroring real-world software development. Students then iteratively complete tasks that pass predefined tests. The instructor only manages a hidden parent repository containing solutions, which is used to generate an intermediate public repository with these solutions removed via a templating system. Students are invited collaborators on private forks of this intermediate repository, possibly updated throughout the semester whenever the teacher changes the parent repository. This approach reduces grading platform dependency, supports automated feedback, and allows the project to evolve without disrupting student work. Successfully tested over several years, including in an edX MOOC, this organizational pipeline provides transparent evaluation, plagiarism detection, and continuous progress tracking for each student.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Fidelity Estimation for Quantum Programs with Graph-Guided Noise Awareness](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14713v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fidelity estimation is a critical yet resource-intensive step in testing quantum programs on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, where the required number of measurements is difficult to predefine due to hardware noise, device heterogeneity, and transpilation-induced circuit transformations. We present QuFid, an adaptive and noise-aware framework that determines measurement budgets online by leveraging circuit structure and runtime statistical feedback. QuFid models a quantum program as a directed acyclic graph (DAG) and employs a control-flow-aware random walk to characterize noise propagation along gate dependencies. Backend-specific effects are captured via transpilation-induced structural deformation metrics, which are integrated into the random-walk formulation to induce a noise-propagation operator. Circuit complexity is then quantified through the spectral characteristics of this operator, providing a principled and lightweight basis for adaptive measurement planning. Experiments on 18 quantum benchmarks executed on IBM Quantum backends show that QuFid significantly reduces measurement cost compared to fixed-shot and learning-based baselines, while consistently maintaining acceptable fidelity bias.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in AAAI 2026;</p></details> |
| **[Online Linear Programming with Replenishment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.14629v1)** | 2026-01-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study an online linear programming (OLP) model in which inventory is not provided upfront but instead arrives gradually through an exogenous stochastic replenishment process. This replenishment-based formulation captures operational settings, such as e-commerce fulfillment, perishable supply chains, and renewable-powered systems, where resources are accumulated gradually and initial inventories are small or zero. The introduction of dispersed, uncertain replenishment fundamentally alters the structure of classical OLPs, creating persistent stockout risk and eliminating advance knowledge of the total budget. We develop new algorithms and regret analyses for three major distributional regimes studied in the OLP literature: bounded distributions, finite-support distributions, and continuous-support distributions with a non-degeneracy condition. For bounded distributions, we design an algorithm that achieves $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}(\sqrt{T})$ regret. For finite-support distributions with a non-degenerate induced LP, we obtain $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ regret, and we establish an $Ω(\sqrt{T})$ lower bound for degenerate instances, demonstrating a sharp separation from the classical setting where $\mathcal{O}(1)$ regret is achievable. For continuous-support, non-degenerate distributions, we develop a two-stage accumulate-then-convert algorithm that achieves $\mathcal{O}(\log^2 T)$ regret, comparable to the $\mathcal{O}(\log T)$ regret in classical OLPs. Together, these results provide a near-complete characterization of the optimal regret achievable in OLP with replenishment. Finally, we empirically evaluate our algorithms and demonstrate their advantages over natural adaptations of classical OLP methods in the replenishment setting.</p></details> | 63 pages, 12 figures |

However, we have found that the application of some major information processing techniques on knowledge graph still lags behind. This defect includes the failure to make sufficient use of advanced logic reasoning, advanced artificial intelligence techniques, special-purpose programming languages, modern probabilistic and statistic theories et al. on knowledge graphs development and application. In particular, the multiple knowledge graphs cooperation and competition techniques have not got enough attention from researchers. This paper develops a systematic theory, technique and application of the concept 'knowledge graph network' and its application in medical and healthcare domain. Our research covers its definition, development, reasoning, computing and application under different conditions such as unsharp, uncertain, multi-modal, vectorized, distributed, federated. Almost in each case we provide (real data) examples and experiment results. Finally, a conclusion of innovation is provided.</p></details> | 33 pages |
| **[Teaching Spell Checkers to Teach: Pedagogical Program Synthesis for Interactive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12115v2)** | 2026-01-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spelling taught through memorization often fails many learners, particularly children with language-based learning disorders who struggle with the phonological skills necessary to spell words accurately. Educators such as speech-language pathologists (SLPs) address this instructional gap by using an inquiry-based approach to teach spelling that targets the phonology, morphology, meaning, and etymology of words. Yet, these strategies rarely appear in everyday writing tools, which simply detect and autocorrect errors. We introduce SPIRE (Spelling Inquiry Engine), a spell check system that brings this inquiry-based pedagogy into the act of composition. SPIRE implements Pedagogical Program Synthesis, a novel approach for operationalizing the inherently dynamic pedagogy of spelling instruction. SPIRE represents SLP instructional moves in a domain-specific language, synthesizes tailored programs in real-time from learner errors, and renders them as interactive interfaces for inquiry-based interventions. With SPIRE, spelling errors become opportunities to explore word meanings, word structures, morphological families, word origins, and grapheme-phoneme correspondences, supporting metalinguistic reasoning alongside correction. Evaluation with SLPs and learners shows alignment with professional practice and potential for integration into writing workflows.</p></details> | IUI 2026 |
