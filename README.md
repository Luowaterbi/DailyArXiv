| **[The Voronoi Spherical CDF for Lattices and Linear Codes: New Bounds for Quantization and Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19791v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For a lattice/linear code, we define the Voronoi spherical cumulative density function (CDF) as the CDF of the $\ell_2$-norm/Hamming weight of a random vector uniformly distributed over the Voronoi cell. Using the first moment method together with a simple application of Jensen's inequality, we develop lower bounds on the expected Voronoi spherical CDF of a random lattice/linear code. Our bounds are quite close to a trivial ball-based lower bound and immediately translate to improved upper bounds on the normalized second moment and the error probability of a random lattice over the additive white Gaussian noise channel, as well as improved upper bounds on the Hamming distortion and the error probability of a random linear code over the binary symmetric channel.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Reproduction to Replication: Evaluating Research Agents with Progressive Code Masking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19724v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in autonomous code generation has fueled excitement around AI agents capable of accelerating scientific discovery by running experiments. However, there is currently no benchmark that evaluates whether such agents can implement scientific ideas when given varied amounts of code as a starting point, interpolating between reproduction (running code) and from-scratch replication (fully re-implementing and running code). We introduce AutoExperiment, a benchmark that evaluates AI agents' ability to implement and run machine learning experiments based on natural language descriptions in research papers. In each task, agents are given a research paper, a codebase with key functions masked out, and a command to run the experiment. The goal is to generate the missing code, execute the experiment in a sandboxed environment, and reproduce the results. AutoExperiment scales in difficulty by varying the number of missing functions $n$, ranging from partial reproduction to full replication. We evaluate state-of-the-art agents and find that performance degrades rapidly as $n$ increases. Agents that can dynamically interact with the environment (e.g. to debug their code) can outperform agents in fixed "agentless" harnesses, and there exists a significant gap between single-shot and multi-trial success rates (Pass@1 vs. Pass@5), motivating verifier approaches to our benchmark. Our findings highlight critical challenges in long-horizon code generation, context retrieval, and autonomous experiment execution, establishing AutoExperiment as a new benchmark for evaluating progress in AI-driven scientific experimentation. Our data and code are open-sourced at https://github.com/j1mk1m/AutoExperiment .</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Intelligent Refactoring of Haskell Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19481v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refactoring is a constant activity in software development and maintenance. Scale and maintain software systems are based on code refactoring. However, this process is still labor intensive, as it requires programmers to analyze the codebases in detail to avoid introducing new defects. In this research, we put forward a large language model (LLM)-based multi-agent system to automate the refactoring process on Haskell code. The objective of this research is to evaluate the effect of LLM-based agents in performing structured and semantically accurate refactoring on Haskell code. Our proposed multi-agent system based on specialized agents with distinct roles, including code analysis, refactoring execution, verification, and debugging. To test the effectiveness and practical applicability of the multi-agent system, we conducted evaluations using different open-source Haskell codebases. The results of the experiments carried out showed that the proposed LLM-based multi-agent system could average 11.03% decreased complexity in code, an improvement of 22.46% in overall code quality, and increase performance efficiency by an average of 13.27%. Furthermore, memory allocation was optimized by up to 14.57%. These results highlight the ability of LLM-based multi-agent in managing refactoring tasks targeted toward functional programming paradigms. Our findings hint that LLM-based multi-agent systems integration into the refactoring of functional programming languages can enhance maintainability and support automated development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2502.07928</p></details> |
| **[FuncVul: An Effective Function Level Vulnerability Detection Model using LLM and Code Chunk](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19453v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software supply chain vulnerabilities arise when attackers exploit weaknesses by injecting vulnerable code into widely used packages or libraries within software repositories. While most existing approaches focus on identifying vulnerable packages or libraries, they often overlook the specific functions responsible for these vulnerabilities. Pinpointing vulnerable functions within packages or libraries is critical, as it can significantly reduce the risks associated with using open-source software. Identifying vulnerable patches is challenging because developers often submit code changes that are unrelated to vulnerability fixes. To address this issue, this paper introduces FuncVul, an innovative code chunk-based model for function-level vulnerability detection in C/C++ and Python, designed to identify multiple vulnerabilities within a function by focusing on smaller, critical code segments. To assess the model's effectiveness, we construct six code and generic code chunk based datasets using two approaches: (1) integrating patch information with large language models to label vulnerable samples and (2) leveraging large language models alone to detect vulnerabilities in function-level code. To design FuncVul vulnerability model, we utilise GraphCodeBERT fine tune model that captures both the syntactic and semantic aspects of code. Experimental results show that FuncVul outperforms existing state-of-the-art models, achieving an average accuracy of 87-92% and an F1 score of 86-92% across all datasets. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that our code-chunk-based FuncVul model improves 53.9% accuracy and 42.0% F1-score than the full function-based vulnerability prediction. The FuncVul code and datasets are publicly available on GitHub at https://github.com/sajalhalder/FuncVul.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Th...</summary><p>In The 30th European Symposium on Research in Computer Security (ESORICS), 22 Sep - 26 Sep, 2025, Toulouse, France</p></details> |
| **[Two classes of NMDS codes from Roth-Lempel codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19346v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since near maximum distance separable (NMDS) codes have good algebraic properties and excellent error-correcting capabilities, they have been widely used in various fields such as communication systems, data storage, quantum codes, and so on. In this paper, basing on the generator matrix of Roth-Lempel codes, we present two classes of NMDS codes which generalize Han's and Zheng's constructions in 2023 and 2025, respectively. And we also completely determine their weight distributions.</p></details> | 22pages |
| **[Explicit Residual-Based Scalable Image Coding for Humans and Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19297v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scalable image compression is a technique that progressively reconstructs multiple versions of an image for different requirements. In recent years, images have increasingly been consumed not only by humans but also by image recognition models. This shift has drawn growing attention to scalable image compression methods that serve both machine and human vision (ICMH). Many existing models employ neural network-based codecs, known as learned image compression, and have made significant strides in this field by carefully designing the loss functions. In some cases, however, models are overly reliant on their learning capacity, and their architectural design is not sufficiently considered. In this paper, we enhance the coding efficiency and interpretability of ICMH framework by integrating an explicit residual compression mechanism, which is commonly employed in resolution scalable coding methods such as JPEG2000. Specifically, we propose two complementary methods: Feature Residual-based Scalable Coding (FR-ICMH) and Pixel Residual-based Scalable Coding (PR-ICMH). These proposed methods are applicable to various machine vision tasks. Moreover, they provide flexibility to choose between encoder complexity and compression performance, making it adaptable to diverse application requirements. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed methods, with PR-ICMH achieving up to 29.57% BD-rate savings over the previous work.</p></details> |  |
| **[On reversible and reversible-complementary DNA codes over $\mathbb{F}_{4}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19170v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A method to construct and count all the linear codes (of arbitrary length) in $\mathbb{F}_{4}$ that are invariant under reverse permutation and that contain the repetition code is presented. These codes are suitable for constructing DNA codes that satisfy the reverse and reverse-complement constraints. By analyzing a module-theoretic structure of these codes, their generating matrices are characterized in terms of their isomorphism type, and explicit formulas for counting them are provided. The proposed construction method based on this characterization outperforms the one given by Abualrub et al. for cyclic codes (of odd length) over $\mathbb{F}_{4}$, and the counting method solves a problem that can not be solved using the one given by Fripertinger for invariant subspaces under a linear endomorphism of $\mathbb{F}_{q}^{n}$. Additionally, several upper bounds and an identity for the minimum Hamming distance of certain reversible codes are provided.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code Graph Model (CGM): A Graph-Integrated Large Language Model for Repository-Level Software Engineering Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16901v4)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in function-level code generation, yet repository-level software engineering tasks remain challenging. Current solutions predominantly rely on proprietary LLM agents, which introduce unpredictability and limit accessibility, raising concerns about data privacy and model customization. This paper investigates whether open-source LLMs can effectively address repository-level tasks without requiring agent-based approaches. We demonstrate this is possible by enabling LLMs to comprehend functions and files within codebases through their semantic information and structural dependencies. To this end, we introduce Code Graph Models (CGMs), which integrate repository code graph structures into the LLM's attention mechanism and map node attributes to the LLM's input space using a specialized adapter. When combined with an agentless graph RAG framework, our approach achieves a 43.00% resolution rate on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark using the open-source Qwen2.5-72B model. This performance ranks first among open weight models, second among methods with open-source systems, and eighth overall, surpassing the previous best open-source model-based method by 12.33%.</p></details> | 35 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Black-Box Test Code Fault Localization Driven by Large Language Models and Execution Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19045v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization (FL) is a critical step in debugging which typically relies on repeated executions to pinpoint faulty code regions. However, repeated executions can be impractical in the presence of non-deterministic failures or high execution costs. While recent efforts have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to aid execution-free FL, these have primarily focused on identifying faults in the system under test (SUT) rather than in the often complex system test code. However, the latter is also important as, in practice, many failures are triggered by faulty test code. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a fully static, LLM-driven approach for system test code fault localization (TCFL) that does not require executing the test case. Our method uses a single failure execution log to estimate the test's execution trace through three novel algorithms that identify only code statements likely involved in the failure. This pruned trace, combined with the error message, is used to prompt the LLM to rank potential faulty locations. Our black-box, system-level approach requires no access to the SUT source code and is applicable to large test scripts that assess full system behavior. We evaluate our technique at function, block, and line levels using an industrial dataset of faulty test cases not previously used in pre-training LLMs. Results show that our best estimated trace closely match actual traces, with an F1 score of around 90%. Additionally, pruning the complex system test code reduces the LLM's inference time by up to 34% without any loss in FL performance. Our results further suggest that block-level TCFL offers a practical balance, narrowing the search space while preserving useful context, achieving an 81% hit rate at top-3 (Hit@3).</p></details> |  |
| **[Oblivious Deletion Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18878v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We construct deletion error-correcting codes in the oblivious model, where errors are adversarial but oblivious to the encoder's randomness. Oblivious errors bridge the gap between the adversarial and random error models, and are motivated by applications like DNA storage, where the noise is caused by hard-to-model physical phenomena, but not by an adversary. (1) (Explicit oblivious) We construct $t$ oblivious deletion codes, with redundancy $\sim 2t\log n$, matching the existential bound for adversarial deletions. (2) (List decoding implies explicit oblivious) We show that explicit list-decodable codes yield explicit oblivious deletion codes with essentially the same parameters. By a work of Guruswami and H\r{a}stad (IEEE TIT, 2021), this gives 2 oblivious deletion codes with redundancy $\sim 3\log n$, beating the existential redundancy for 2 adversarial deletions. (3) (Randomized oblivious) We give a randomized construction of oblivious codes that, with probability at least $1-2^{-n}$, produces a code correcting $t$ oblivious deletions with redundancy $\sim(t+1)\log n$, beating the existential adversarial redundancy of $\sim 2t\log n$. (4) (Randomized adversarial) Studying the oblivious model can inform better constructions of adversarial codes. The same technique produces, with probability at least $1-2^{-n}$, a code correcting $t$ adversarial deletions with redundancy $\sim (2t+1)\log n$, nearly matching the existential redundancy of $\sim 2t\log n$. The common idea behind these results is to reduce the hash size by modding by a prime chosen (randomly) from a small subset, and including a small encoding of the prime in the hash.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context-Aware CodeLLM Eviction for AI-assisted Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18796v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-assisted coding tools powered by Code Large Language Models (CodeLLMs) are increasingly integrated into modern software development workflows. To address concerns around privacy, latency, and model customization, many enterprises opt to self-host these models. However, the diversity and growing number of CodeLLMs, coupled with limited accelerator memory, introduce practical challenges in model management and serving efficiency. This paper presents CACE, a novel context-aware model eviction strategy designed specifically to optimize self-hosted CodeLLM serving under resource constraints. Unlike traditional eviction strategies based solely on recency (e.g., Least Recently Used), CACE leverages multiple context-aware factors, including model load time, task-specific latency sensitivity, expected output length, and recent usage and future demand tracked through a sliding window. We evaluate CACE using realistic workloads that include both latency-sensitive code completion and throughput-intensive code reasoning tasks. Our experiments show that CACE reduces Time-to-First-Token (TTFT) and end-to-end (E2E) latency, while significantly lowering the number of model evictions compared to state-of-the-art systems. Ablation studies further demonstrate the importance of multi-factor eviction in balancing responsiveness and resource efficiency. This work contributes practical strategies for deploying scalable, low-latency AI coding assistants in real-world software engineering environments.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Programming by Backprop: LLMs Acquire Reusable Algorithmic Abstractions During Code Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18777v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models (LLMs) on source code significantly enhances their general-purpose reasoning abilities, but the mechanisms underlying this generalisation are poorly understood. In this paper, we propose Programming by Backprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to evaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without ever seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of programs representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source code and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We find evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for inputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations. Firstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code rather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can produce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the program within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the program in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more robust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn from a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest a mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to internalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for future work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures, and progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by training on formal constitutional principles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explicit Constructions of Sum-Rank Metric Codes from Quadratic Kummer Extensions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18653v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents new constructions of sum-rank metric codes derived from algebraic function fields, while the existing results about such codes remain limited. A central challenge in this field involves the determination of parameters. We address this challenge through quadratic Kummer extensions, and propose two general constructions of $2\times2$ sum-rank codes. The novel sum-rank metric code constructions derived from algebraic function fields demonstrate superior code lengths compared to conventional coding paradigms, particularly when contrasted with linearized Reed-Solomon codes under equivalent code parameter constraints. We also establish explicit parameters including dimensions and minimum distances of our codes. Finally, an illustrative example through elliptic function fields is constructed for validating the theoretical framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Simple but Accurate Approximation for Multivariate Gaussian Rate-Distortion Function and Its Application in Maximal Coding Rate Reduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18613v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multivariate Gaussian rate-distortion (RD) function is crucial in various applications, such as digital communications, data storage, or neural networks. However, the complex form of the multivariate Gaussian RD function prevents its application in many neural network-based scenarios that rely on its analytical properties, for example, white-box neural networks, multi-device task-oriented communication, and semantic communication. This paper proposes a simple but accurate approximation for the multivariate Gaussian RD function. The upper and lower bounds on the approximation error (the difference between the approximate and the exact value) are derived, which indicate that for well-conditioned covariance matrices, the approximation error is small. In particular, when the condition number of the covariance matrix approaches 1, the approximation error approaches 0. In addition, based on the proposed approximation, a new classification algorithm called Adaptive Regularized ReduNet (AR-ReduNet) is derived by applying the approximation to ReduNet, which is a white-box classification network oriented from Maximal Coding Rate Reduction (MCR$^2$) principle. Simulation results indicate that AR-ReduNet achieves higher accuracy and more efficient optimization than ReduNet.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures.

We introduce the Debugging Decay Index (DDI), a mathematical framework that quantifies when debugging becomes ineffective and predicts intervention points. Our strategic fresh start approach shifts from exploitation to exploration at strategic points in the debugging process, demonstrating that well-timed interventions can rescue the effectiveness of debugging. DDI reveals a fundamental limitation in current AI debugging and provides the first quantitative framework for optimising iterative code generation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Your Token Becomes Worthless: Unveiling Rug Pull Schemes in Crypto Token via Code-and-Transaction Fusion Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18398v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rug pull scams have emerged as a persistent threat to cryptocurrency, causing significant financial losses. A typical scenario involves scammers deploying honeypot contracts to attract investments, restricting token sales, and draining the funds, which leaves investors with worthless tokens. Current methods either rely on predefined patterns to detect code risks or utilize statistical transaction data to train detection models. However, real-world Rug Pull schemes often involve a complex interplay between malicious code and suspicious transaction behaviors. These methods, which solely focus on one aspect, fall short in detecting such schemes effectively. In this paper, we propose RPhunter, a novel technique that integrates code and transaction for Rug Pull detection. First, RPhunter establishes declarative rules and performs flow analysis to extract code risk information, further constructing a semantic risk code graph (SRCG). Meanwhile, to leverage transaction information, RPhunter formulates dynamic token transaction activities as a token flow behavior graph (TFBG) in which nodes and edges are characterized from network structure and market manipulation perspectives. Finally, RPhunter employs graph neural networks to extract complementary features from SRCG and TFBG, integrating them through an attention fusion model to enhance the detection of Rug Pull. We manually analyzed 645 Rug Pull incidents from code and transaction aspects and constructed a ground-truth dataset. We evaluated RPhunter on our dataset, achieving a precision of 95.3%, a recall of 93.8% and an F1 score of 94.5%, which highlights superior performance compared to existing state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, when applied to the real-world scenarios, RPhunter has identified 4801 Rug Pull tokens, achieving a precision of 91%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rack-Aware MSR Codes with Linear Field Size and Smaller Sub-Packetization for Tolerating Multiple Erasures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18367v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an $(n,k,d)$ rack-aware storage model, the system consists of $n$ nodes uniformly distributed across $\bar{n}$ successive racks, such that each rack contains $u$ nodes of equal capacity and the reconstructive degree satisfies $k=\bar{k}u+v$ where $0\leq v\leq u-1$. Suppose there are $h\geq1$ failed nodes in a rack (called the host rack). Then together with its surviving nodes, the host rack downloads recovery data from $\bar{d}$ helper racks and repairs its failed nodes. In this paper, we focus on studying the rack-aware minimum storage generating (MSR) codes for repairing $h$ failed nodes within the same rack. By using the coupled-layer construction with the alignment technique, we construct the first class of rack-aware MSR codes for all $\bar{k}+1\leq\bar{d}\leq\bar{n}-1$ which achieve the small sub-packetization $l=\bar{s}^{\lceil\bar{n}/\bar{s}\rceil}$ where the field size $q$ increases linearly with $n$ and $\bar{s}=\bar{d}-\bar{k}+1$. In addition, these codes achieve optimal repair bandwidth for $1\leq h\leq u-v$, and asymptotically optimal repair bandwidth for $u-v+1\leq h\leq u$. In particular, they achieve optimal access when $h=u-v$. It is worth noting that the existing rack-aware MSR codes which achieve the same sub-packetization $l=\bar{s}^{\lceil\bar{n}/\bar{s}\rceil}$ are only known for the special case of $\bar{d}=\bar{n}-1$, $h=1$, and the field size is much larger than ours. Then, based on our first construction we further develop another class of explicit rack-aware MSR codes with even smaller sub-packetization $l=\bar{s}^{\lceil\bar{n}/(\bar{s}+1)\rceil}$ for all admissible values of $\bar{d}$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predictive Analytics for Collaborators Answers, Code Quality, and Dropout on Stack Overflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18329v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Previous studies that used data from Stack Overflow to develop predictive models often employed limited benchmarks of 3-5 models or adopted arbitrary selection methods. Despite being insightful, their limited scope suggests the need to benchmark more models to avoid overlooking untested algorithms. Our study evaluates 21 algorithms across three tasks: predicting the number of question a user is likely to answer, their code quality violations, and their dropout status. We employed normalisation, standardisation, as well as logarithmic and power transformations paired with Bayesian hyperparameter optimisation and genetic algorithms. CodeBERT, a pre-trained language model for both natural and programming languages, was fine-tuned to classify user dropout given their posts (questions and answers) and code snippets. We found Bagging ensemble models combined with standardisation achieved the highest R2 value (0.821) in predicting user answers. The Stochastic Gradient Descent regressor, followed by Bagging and Epsilon Support Vector Machine models, consistently demonstrated superior performance to other benchmarked algorithms in predicting user code quality across multiple quality dimensions and languages. Extreme Gradient Boosting paired with log-transformation exhibited the highest F1-score (0.825) in predicting user dropout. CodeBERT was able to classify user dropout with a final F1-score of 0.809, validating the performance of Extreme Gradient Boosting that was solely based on numerical data. Overall, our benchmarking of 21 algorithms provides multiple insights. Researchers can leverage findings regarding the most suitable models for specific target variables, and practitioners can utilise the identified optimal hyperparameters to reduce the initial search space during their own hyperparameter tuning processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 17 tables, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Use Property-Based Testing to Bridge LLM Code Generation and Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18315v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, but ensuring their outputs to be functionally correct, especially in complex programming tasks, is a persistent challenge. While traditional Test-Driven Development (TDD) offers a path for code refinement, its efficacy with LLMs is often undermined by the scarcity of high-quality test cases or the pitfalls of automated test generation, including biased tests or inaccurate output predictions that can misdirect the correction process. This paper introduces Property-Generated Solver, a novel framework that leverages Property-Based Testing (PBT) to validate high-level program properties or invariants, instead of relying on specific input-output examples. These properties are often simpler to define and verify than directly predicting exhaustive test oracles, breaking the "cycle of self-deception" where tests might share flaws with the code they are meant to validate. Property-Generated Solver employs two collaborative LLM-based agents: a Generator dedicated to code generation and iterative refinement, and a Tester that manages the PBT life-cycle and formulate semantically rich feedback from property violations. The resulting comprehensive and actionable feedback then guides the Generator in its refinement efforts. By establishing PBT as the core validation engine within this iterative, closed-loop paradigm, Property-Generated Solver provides a robust mechanism for steering LLMs towards more correct and generalizable code. Extensive experimental results on multiple code generation benchmarks demonstrate that Property-Generated Solver achieves substantial pass@1 improvements, ranging from 23.1% to 37.3% relative gains over established TDD methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating Energy-efficient code with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10599v2)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing electricity demands of personal computers, communication networks, and data centers contribute to higher atmospheric greenhouse gas emissions, which in turn lead to global warming and climate change. Therefore the energy consumption of code must be minimized. Code can be generated by large language models. We look at the influence of prompt modification on the energy consumption of the code generated. We use three different Python code problems of varying difficulty levels. Prompt modification is done by adding the sentence ``Give me an energy-optimized solution for this problem'' or by using two Python coding best practices. The large language models used are CodeLlama-70b, CodeLlama-70b-Instruct, CodeLlama-70b-Python, DeepSeek-Coder-33b-base, and DeepSeek-Coder-33b-instruct. We find a decrease in energy consumption for a specific combination of prompt optimization, LLM, and Python code problem. However, no single optimization prompt consistently decreases energy consumption for the same LLM across the different Python code problems.</p></details> |  |

We propose a two-stage training framework combining contrastive learning and conditional decoding to enable flexible style control. The first stage aligns code style representations with semantic and structural features. In the second stage, we fine-tune a language model (e.g., Flan-T5) conditioned on the learned style vector to guide generation. Our method supports style interpolation and user personalization via lightweight mixing. Compared to prior work, our unified framework offers improved stylistic control without sacrificing code correctness. This is among the first approaches to combine contrastive alignment with conditional decoding for style-guided code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, submitted to EMNLP 2025 (Industry Track)</p></details> |
| **[Build It Clean: Large-Scale Detection of Code Smells in Build Scripts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17948v1)** | 2025-06-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Build scripts are files that automate the process of compiling source code, managing dependencies, running tests, and packaging software into deployable artifacts. These scripts are ubiquitous in modern software development pipelines for streamlining testing and delivery. While developing build scripts, practitioners may inadvertently introduce code smells. Code smells are recurring patterns of poor coding practices that may lead to build failures or increase risk and technical debt. The goal of this study is to aid practitioners in avoiding code smells in build scripts through an empirical study of build scripts and issues on GitHub. We employed a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative analysis. We conducted a qualitative analysis of 2000 build-script-related GitHub issues. Next, we developed a static analysis tool, Sniffer, to identify code smells in 5882 build scripts of Maven, Gradle, CMake, and Make files, collected from 4877 open-source GitHub repositories. We identified 13 code smell categories, with a total of 10,895 smell occurrences, where 3184 were in Maven, 1214 in Gradle, 337 in CMake, and 6160 in Makefiles. Our analysis revealed that Insecure URLs were the most prevalent code smell in Maven build scripts, while Hardcoded Paths/URLs were commonly observed in both Gradle and CMake scripts. Wildcard Usage emerged as the most frequent smell in Makefiles.

While code generation using LLMs has become a popular field of research, code evaluation using LLMs remains under-explored. In this paper, we focus on LLM-based code evaluation and attempt to fill in the existing gaps. We propose multi-agentic novel approaches using \emph{question-specific rubrics} tailored to the problem statement, arguing that these perform better for logical assessment than the existing approaches that use \emph{question-agnostic rubrics}. To address the lack of suitable evaluation datasets, we introduce two datasets: a Data Structures and Algorithms dataset containing 150 student submissions from a popular Data Structures and Algorithms practice website, and an Object Oriented Programming dataset comprising 80 student submissions from undergraduate computer science courses. In addition to using standard metrics (Spearman Correlation, Cohen's Kappa), we additionally propose a new metric called as Leniency, which quantifies evaluation strictness relative to expert assessment. Our comprehensive analysis demonstrates that \emph{question-specific rubrics} significantly enhance logical assessment of code in educational settings, providing better feedback aligned with instructional goals beyond mere syntactic correctness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ICER 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Functional Correctness: Investigating Coding Style Inconsistencies in Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00456v2)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have brought a paradigm shift to the field of code generation, offering the potential to enhance the software development process. However, previous research mainly focuses on the accuracy of code generation, while coding style differences between LLMs and human developers remain under-explored. In this paper, we empirically analyze the differences in coding style between the code generated by mainstream Code LLMs and the code written by human developers, and summarize coding style inconsistency taxonomy. Specifically, we first summarize the types of coding style inconsistencies by manually analyzing a large number of generation results. We then compare the code generated by Code LLMs with the code written by human programmers in terms of readability, conciseness, and robustness. The results reveal that LLMs and developers have different coding styles. Additionally, we study the possible causes of these inconsistencies and provide some solutions to alleviate the problem.</p></details> | 13pages, 14 figures |
| **[A Locally Differential Private Coding-Assisted Succinct Histogram Protocol](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17767v1)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A succinct histogram captures frequent items and their frequencies across clients and has become increasingly important for large-scale, privacy-sensitive machine learning applications. To develop a rigorous framework to guarantee privacy for the succinct histogram problem, local differential privacy (LDP) has been utilized and shown promising results. To preserve data utility under LDP, which essentially works by intentionally adding noise to data, error-correcting codes naturally emerge as a promising tool for reliable information collection. This work presents the first practical $(\epsilon,\delta)$-LDP protocol for constructing succinct histograms using error-correcting codes. To this end, polar codes and their successive-cancellation list (SCL) decoding algorithms are leveraged as the underlying coding scheme. More specifically, our protocol introduces Gaussian-based perturbations to enable efficient soft decoding. Experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior methods, particularly for items with low true frequencies, while maintaining similar frequency estimation accuracy.</p></details> |  |

However, current approaches often face challenges in computational efficiency and lack robust mechanisms for code parsing and error correction. In this work, we propose a novel framework, PyCapsule, with a simple yet effective two-agent pipeline and efficient self-debugging modules for Python code generation. PyCapsule features sophisticated prompt inference, iterative error handling, and case testing, ensuring high generation stability, safety, and correctness. Empirically, PyCapsule achieves up to 5.7% improvement of success rate on HumanEval, 10.3% on HumanEval-ET, and 24.4% on BigCodeBench compared to the state-of-art methods. We also observe a decrease in normalized success rate given more self-debugging attempts, potentially affected by limited and noisy error feedback in retention. PyCapsule demonstrates broader impacts on advancing lightweight and efficient code generation for artificial intelligence systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[EditLord: Learning Code Transformation Rules for Code Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15284v3)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code editing is a foundational task in software development, where its effectiveness depends on whether it introduces desired code property changes without changing the original code's intended functionality. Existing approaches often formulate code editing as an implicit end-to-end task, omitting the fact that code-editing procedures inherently consist of discrete and explicit steps. Thus, they suffer from suboptimal performance and lack of robustness and generalization. We introduce EditLord, a code editing framework that makes the code transformation steps explicit. Our key insight is to employ a language model (LM) as an inductive learner to extract code editing rules from the training code pairs as concise meta-rule sets. Such rule sets will be manifested for each training sample to augment them for finetuning or assist in prompting- and iterative-based code editing. EditLordoutperforms the state-of-the-art by an average of 22.7% in editing performance and 58.1% in robustness while achieving 20.2% higher functional correctness across critical software engineering and security applications, LM models, and editing modes.</p></details> |  |

We base our approach on code transformations, wherein we construct a space of scheduling candidates and rank them via a heuristic cost model to effectively handle the large diversity of computational workloads that can be expressed in this way. We present a design of a search space to which the cost model is applied, along with an associated pruning strategy to limit the number of configurations that need to be empirically evaluated. The goal of our design is to strike a balance between the device's latency-hiding capabilities and the amount of state space, a key factor in attaining near-roofline performance. To make our work widely available, we have prototyped our parallelization strategy within the \textsc{Firedrake} framework, a UFL-based FEM solver. We evaluate the performance of our parallelization scheme on two generations of Nvidia GPUs, specifically the Titan V (Volta architecture) and Tesla K40c (Kepler architecture), across a range of operators commonly used in applications, including fluid dynamics, wave propagation, and structural mechanics, in 2D and 3D geometries. Our results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves more than $50\%$ roofline performance in $65\%$ of the test cases on both devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Unlearning for Source Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17125v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM4SE has demonstrated significant success, but LLMs' potential memorization of sensitive or outdated training data introduces critical risks to legal compliance, software security, and code quality. LLM unlearning techniques, which can eliminate the influence of undesired data from LLMs in a post-training way, present a promising solution to address these concerns. While recent efforts in LLM unlearning show effectiveness in natural language, their applicability to source code remains underexplored. Our empirical study reveals that existing LLM unlearning approaches, when applied to source code, cause severe model utility degradation, rendering models practically unusable for code generation. In this paper, we propose PROD, a novel unlearning approach that enables LLMs to forget undesired code content while effectively preserving their code generation capabilities. PROD suppresses the probability of forget data in LLMs' output distribution while promoting candidate distributional components, enabling the model to jointly learn to forget specific content and retain its general capabilities. To facilitate this study, we establish a benchmark for code unlearning evaluation, which includes three critical downstream tasks: copyrighted code unlearning, insecure code unlearning, and deprecated API unlearning. Our evaluation demonstrates that PROD achieves superior balance between forget quality and model utility compared to existing unlearning approaches across three downstream tasks, while consistently exhibiting improvements when applied to LLMs of varying series. PROD also exhibits superior robustness against adversarial attacks without generating or exposing the data to be forgotten. The results underscore that our approach not only extends the application boundary of unlearning techniques to source code, but also holds significant implications for advancing reliable code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reassessing Code Authorship Attribution in the Era of Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17120v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study of Code Stylometry, and in particular Code Authorship Attribution (CAA), aims to analyze coding styles to identify the authors of code samples. CAA is crucial in cybersecurity and software forensics for addressing, detecting plagiarism, and supporting criminal prosecutions. However, CAA is a complex and error prone task, due to the need for recognizing nuanced relationships between coding patterns. This challenge is compounded in large software systems with numerous authors due to the subtle variability of patterns that signify the coding style of one author among many. Given the challenges related to this task, researchers have proposed and studied automated approaches that rely upon classical Machine Learning and Deep Learning techniques. However, such techniques have historically relied upon hand-crafted features, and due to the often intricate interaction of different features (e.g., formatting, etc.), have key limitations in properly characterizing authorship, and are sensitive to adversarial code perturbations. Recently, transformer-based Language Models (LMs) have shown remarkable efficacy across a range of software engineering tasks, and in the authorship attribution on natural language in the NLP domain. However, their effectiveness in CAA is not well understood. As such, we conduct the first extensive empirical study applying two larger state-of-the-art code LMs, and five smaller code LMs to the task of CAA to 6 diverse datasets that encompass 12k code snippets written by 463 developers. Furthermore, we perform an in-depth analysis of our studied models' performance on CAA using established machine learning interpretability techniques. The results of our analysis illustrate important findings that illuminate the behavior of LMs in understanding stylometric code patterns during the task of CAA, and point towards important directions for future work.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Re-Evaluating Code LLM Benchmarks Under Semantic Mutation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17369v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of large language models (LLMs), code benchmarks have become an important research area in software engineering and are widely used by practitioners. These benchmarks evaluate the performance of LLMs on specific code-related tasks, such as code understanding and generation. A critical step in constructing code benchmarks is the design of prompts. However, as existing code benchmarks typically rely on a single prompt template per task, they are prone to the issue of prompt sensitivity, where minor prompt variations could result in substantial performance variations, leading to unreliable evaluations of model capabilities. While previous studies have explored prompt sensitivity, their experimental designs and findings are limited to traditional natural language processing (NLP) tasks. In this paper, we present an empirical study to investigate prompt sensitivity in code benchmarks. We first propose a general framework that modifies prompt templates in a manner that preserves both their semantics and their structure as much as possible. Based on the framework, we conduct extensive experiments across eight code benchmark tasks on 10 representative open-source LLMs, with each task featuring 100 semantically similar prompt templates. We then analyze the evaluation results using various statistical metrics, focusing on both absolute and relative model performance. Our findings suggest that even slight prompt variations can lead to significant shifts in performance. Additionally, we observe that such variations can introduce inconsistencies in the performance rankings across different models. These insights highlight the need for considering prompt sensitivity when designing future code benchmarks, to ensure more reliable and accurate evaluation of LLM capabilities.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) present a promising opportunity for researchers to produce publication-ready material using LaTeX with natural language instructions, yet current benchmarks completely lack evaluation of this ability. By introducing TeXpert, our benchmark dataset with natural language prompts for generating LaTeX code focused on components of scientific documents across multiple difficulty levels, we conduct an in-depth analysis of LLM performance in this regard and identify frequent error types. Our evaluation across open and closed-source LLMs highlights multiple key findings: LLMs excelling on standard benchmarks perform poorly in LaTeX generation with a significant accuracy drop-off as the complexity of tasks increases; open-source models like DeepSeek v3 and DeepSeek Coder strongly rival closed-source counterparts in LaTeX tasks; and formatting and package errors are unexpectedly prevalent, suggesting a lack of diverse LaTeX examples in the training datasets of most LLMs. Our dataset, code, and model evaluations are available at https://github.com/knowledge-verse-ai/TeXpert.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the SDProc Workshop @ ACL 2025</p></details> |

We focus on systems where each server stores one code symbol, and a user recovers a data symbol by accessing any of its recovery groups, subject to per-server capacity limits. The SRR--the convex polytope of simultaneously achievable request rates--captures system throughput and scalability. We first derive upper and lower bounds on the maximum request rate of each data object. These bounds hold for all linear codes and depend only on the number of parity checks orthogonal to a particular set of codeword coordinates associated with that object, i.e., the equations used in majority-logic decoding, and on code parameters. We then check the bound saturation for 1) all non-systematic codes whose SRRs are already known and 2) systematic codes. For the former, we prove the bounds are tight. For systematic codes, we show that the upper bound is achieved whenever the supports of minimum-weight dual codewords form a 2-design. As an application, we determine the exact per-object demand limits for binary Hamming codes. Our framework provides a new lens to address the SRR problem through combinatorial design theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 and...</summary><p>7 and a half pages, zero figure</p></details> |

The decoder optimizes the standard parity-check matrix using heuristic binary summation and random cyclic row shifts, resulting in a Tanner graph with low density, controlled redundancy, and minimized length-4 cycles. The impact of row redundancy and rank deficiency in the dual code's minimum-weight codewords on decoding performance is analyzed. To improve convergence, three random automorphisms are applied simultaneously to the inputs, with the resulting messages merged at the end of each iteration. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, for BCH codes with block lengths of 63 and 127, the enhanced normalized min-sum decoder achieves a 1-2 dB performance gain and 100X faster convergence compared to existing parallel and iterative decoders. Additionally, a hybrid decoding scheme is proposed, which selectively activates order statistics decoding when the enhanced normalized min-sum decoder fails. This hybrid approach is shown to approach maximum-likelihood performance while retaining the advantages of the normalized min-sum decoder across a broad SNR range.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables.

However, prior research has largely overlooked the security risks inherent in the generated code. In this work, we introduce SafeGenBench, a benchmark specifically designed to assess the security of LLM-generated code. The dataset encompasses a wide range of common software development scenarios and vulnerability types. Building upon this benchmark, we develop an automatic evaluation framework that leverages both static application security testing(SAST) and LLM-based judging to assess the presence of security vulnerabilities in model-generated code. Through the empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on SafeGenBench, we reveal notable deficiencies in their ability to produce vulnerability-free code. Our findings highlight pressing challenges and offer actionable insights for future advancements in the secure code generation performance of LLMs. The data and code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

Despite its benefits, the high computational complexity of effective ordered statistics decoding has limited its application in complexity-sensitive scenarios. To mitigate this issue, we propose a novel variant of the ordered statistics decoder. This approach begins with the design of a neural network model that refines the measurement of codeword bits, utilizing iterative information from normalized min-sum decoding failures. Subsequently, a fixed decoding path is established, comprising a sequence of blocks, each featuring a variety of test error patterns. The introduction of a sliding window-assisted neural model facilitates early termination of the ordered statistics decoding process along this path, aiming to balance performance and computational complexity. Comprehensive simulations and complexity analyses demonstrate that the proposed hybrid method matches state-of-the-art approaches across various metrics, particularly excelling in reducing latency.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 5 figures, 1 table.

When $\phi$ is the identity map $I$, we retrieve the construction of [1] and use it to prove the existence of asymptotically good binary CSS-T codes, resolving a previously open problem in the literature, and of asymptotically good quantum LDPC CSS-T codes. We analyze the structure of the logical operators corresponding to certain non-Clifford gates supported by the quantum codes obtained from this construction ($\phi = I$), concluding that they always result in the logical identity. An immediate application of these codes in dealing with coherent noise is discussed. We then develop a new doubling transformation for obtaining triorthogonal codes, which generalizes the doubling construction presented in [2].

A code is near-MDS (NMDS) if both it and its dual are AMDS. NMDS codes supporting combinatorial $t$-designs have attracted growing interest, yet constructing such codes remains highly challenging. In 2020, Ding and Tang initiated the study of NMDS codes supporting 2-designs by constructing the first infinite family, followed by several other constructions for $t > 2$, all with length at most $q + 1$. Although NMDS codes can, in principle, exceed this length, known examples supporting 2-designs and having length greater than $q + 1$ are extremely rare and limited to a few sporadic binary and ternary cases. In this paper, we present the first \emph{generic construction} of $q$-ary NMDS codes supporting 2-designs with lengths \emph{exceeding $q + 1$}. Our method leverages new connections between elliptic curve codes, finite abelian groups, subset sums, and combinatorial designs, resulting in an infinite family of such codes along with their weight distributions.</p></details> |  |

But as these same tools move human effort up the development stack, they present fresh dangers: 10% of real prompts leak private data, 42% of generated snippets hide security flaws, and the models can even ``agree'' with wrong ideas, a trait called sycophancy. We argue that firms must tag and review every AI-generated line of code, keep prompts and outputs inside private or on-premises deployments, obey emerging safety regulations, and add tests that catch sycophantic answers -- so they can gain speed without losing security and accuracy.</p></details> |  |

For instance, the instruction "Hang a mug on the mug tree" may involve multiple valid actions if there are several mugs and branches to choose from. Existing language-conditioned policies typically rely on end-to-end models that jointly handle high-level semantic understanding and low-level action generation, which can result in suboptimal performance due to their lack of modularity and interpretability. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel robotic manipulation framework that can accomplish tasks specified by potentially ambiguous natural language. This framework employs a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to interpret abstract concepts in natural language instructions and generates task-specific code - an interpretable and executable intermediate representation. The generated code interfaces with the perception module to produce 3D attention maps that highlight task-relevant regions by integrating spatial and semantic information, effectively resolving ambiguities in instructions. Through extensive experiments, we identify key limitations of current imitation learning methods, such as poor adaptation to language and environmental variations. We show that our approach excels across challenging manipulation tasks involving language ambiguity, contact-rich manipulation, and multi-object interactions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Robotics: Science and Systems (RSS) 2025.

However, speech coding presents additional challenges due to real-world noise, which degrades compression efficiency. Standard codecs allocate bits uniformly, wasting bitrate on noise components that do not contribute to intelligibility. This paper introduces a Variable Bitrate RVQ (VRVQ) framework for noise-robust speech coding, dynamically adjusting bitrate per frame to optimize rate-distortion trade-offs. Unlike constant bitrate (CBR) RVQ, our method prioritizes critical speech components while suppressing residual noise. Additionally, we integrate a feature denoiser to further improve noise robustness. Experimental results show that VRVQ improves rate-distortion trade-offs over conventional methods, achieving better compression efficiency and perceptual quality in noisy conditions.

| **[DT-UFC: Universal Large Model Feature Coding via Peaky-to-Balanced Distribution Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16495v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Like image coding in visual data transmission, feature coding is essential for the distributed deployment of large models by significantly reducing transmission and storage overhead. However, prior studies have mostly targeted task- or model-specific scenarios, leaving the challenge of universal feature coding across diverse large models largely unaddressed. In this paper, we present the first systematic study on universal feature coding for large models. The key challenge lies in the inherently diverse and distributionally incompatible nature of features extracted from different models. For example, features from DINOv2 exhibit highly peaky, concentrated distributions, while those from Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) are more dispersed and uniform. This distributional heterogeneity severely hampers both compression efficiency and cross-model generalization. To address this, we propose a learned peaky-to-balanced distribution transformation, which reshapes highly skewed feature distributions into a common, balanced target space. This transformation is non-uniform, data-driven, and plug-and-play, enabling effective alignment of heterogeneous distributions without modifying downstream codecs. With this alignment, a universal codec trained on the balanced target distribution can effectively generalize to features from different models and tasks. We validate our approach on three representative large models-LLaMA3, DINOv2, and SD3-across multiple tasks and modalities. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves notable improvements in both compression efficiency and cross-model generalization over task-specific baselines. All source code will be released for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[AlphaTrans: A Neuro-Symbolic Compositional Approach for Repository-Level Code Translation and Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24117v5)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation transforms programs from one programming language (PL) to another. Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate code translation between different pairs of PLs. However, the rules can become obsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs. Recent studies have explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs). One key observation is that such techniques may work well for crafted benchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-world projects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc. We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-level code translation. AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employs multiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves the functionality of the source program. To break down the problem for LLMs, AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragments and translates them in the reverse call order. We leveraged AlphaTrans to translate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of <836, 8575, 2719> classes, methods, and tests. AlphaTrans breaks down these projects into 17874 fragments and translates the entire repository. 96.40% of the translated fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validates the translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 27.03% and 25.14% of fragments. On average, the integrated translation and validation take 34 hours to translate a project, showing its scalability in practice. For the incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report including existing translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures. We provided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in four projects. They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieve all passing tests.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in FSE 2025</p></details> |

We present a comprehensive evaluation of LLMs (Claude 3.5 Sonnet, GPT-4o, and o3-mini) in establishing trace links between various software documentation (including API references and user guides) and source code. We create two novel datasets from two open-source projects (Unity Catalog and Crawl4AI). Through systematic experiments, we assess three key capabilities: (1) trace link identification accuracy, (2) relationship explanation quality, and (3) multi-step chain reconstruction. Results show that the best-performing LLM achieves F1-scores of 79.4% and 80.4% across the two datasets, substantially outperforming our baselines (TF-IDF, BM25, and CodeBERT). While fully correct relationship explanations range from 42.9% to 71.1%, partial accuracy exceeds 97%, indicating that fundamental connections are rarely missed. For multi-step chains, LLMs maintain high endpoint accuracy but vary in capturing precise intermediate links. Error analysis reveals that many false positives stem from naming-based assumptions, phantom links, or overgeneralization of architectural patterns. We demonstrate that task-framing, such as a one-to-many matching strategy, is critical for performance. These findings position LLMs as powerful assistants for trace discovery, but their limitations could necessitate human-in-the-loop tool design and highlight specific error patterns for future research.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce OJBench, a novel and challenging benchmark designed to assess the competitive-level code reasoning abilities of LLMs. OJBench comprises 232 programming competition problems from NOI and ICPC, providing a more rigorous test of models' reasoning skills. We conducted a comprehensive evaluation using OJBench on 37 models, including both closed-source and open-source models, reasoning-oriented and non-reasoning-oriented models. Our results indicate that even state-of-the-art reasoning-oriented models, such as o4-mini and Gemini-2.5-pro-exp, struggle with highly challenging competition-level problems.

In this thesis, I contribute to this trend by investigating relative entropy coding, a mathematical framework that generalises classical source coding theory. Concretely, relative entropy coding deals with the efficient communication of uncertain or randomised information. One of its key advantages is that it extends compression methods to continuous spaces and can thus be integrated more seamlessly into modern machine learning pipelines than classical quantisation-based approaches. Furthermore, it is a natural foundation for developing advanced compression methods that are privacy-preserving or account for the perceptual quality of the reconstructed data. The thesis considers relative entropy coding at three conceptual levels: After introducing the basics of the framework, (1) I prove results that provide new, maximally tight fundamental limits to the communication and computational efficiency of relative entropy coding; (2) I use the theory of Poisson point processes to develop and analyse new relative entropy coding algorithms, whose performance attains the theoretic optima and (3) I showcase the strong practical performance of relative entropy coding by applying it to image, audio, video and protein data compression using small, energy-efficient, probabilistic neural networks called Bayesian implicit neural representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD T...</summary><p>PhD Thesis. 222 pages, 19 figures</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Time-Dependent Methods and Seasonal Effects in Code Technical Debt Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08095v2)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background. Code Technical Debt (Code TD) prediction has gained significant attention in recent software engineering research. However, no standardized approach to Code TD prediction fully captures the factors influencing its evolution. Objective. Our study aims to assess the impact of time-dependent models and seasonal effects on Code TD prediction. It evaluates such models against widely used Machine Learning models, also considering the influence of seasonality on prediction performance. Methods. We trained 11 prediction models with 31 Java open-source projects. To assess their performance, we predicted future observations of the SQALE index. To evaluate the practical usability of our TD forecasting model and its impact on practitioners, we surveyed 23 software engineering professionals. Results. Our study confirms the benefits of time-dependent techniques, with the ARIMAX model outperforming the others. Seasonal effects improved predictive performance, though the impact remained modest. \ReviewerA{ARIMAX/SARIMAX models demonstrated to provide well-balanced long-term forecasts. The survey highlighted strong industry interest in short- to medium-term TD forecasts. Conclusions. Our findings support using techniques that capture time dependence in historical software metric data, particularly for Code TD. Effectively addressing this evidence requires adopting methods that account for temporal patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[FALCON: Feedback-driven Adaptive Long/short-term memory reinforced Coding Optimization system](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21349v5)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant progress in automated code generation. Despite their strong instruction-following capabilities, these models frequently struggled to align with user intent in coding scenarios. In particular, they were hampered by datasets that lacked diversity and failed to address specialized tasks or edge cases. Furthermore, challenges in supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) led to failures in generating precise, human-intent-aligned code. To tackle these challenges and improve the code generation performance for automated programming systems, we propose Feedback-driven Adaptive Long/short-term memory reinforced Coding Optimization (i.e., FALCON). FALCON is structured into two hierarchical levels. From the global level, long-term memory improves code quality by retaining and applying learned knowledge. At the local level, short-term memory allows for the incorporation of immediate feedback from compilers and AI systems. Additionally, we introduce meta-reinforcement learning with feedback rewards to solve the global-local bi-level optimization problem and enhance the model's adaptability across diverse code generation tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our technique achieves state-of-the-art performance, leading other reinforcement learning methods by more than 4.5 percentage points on the MBPP benchmark and 6.1 percentage points on the Humaneval benchmark. The open-sourced code is publicly available at https://github.com/titurte/FALCON.</p></details> | 20 pages, 7 figures |

As libraries continuously evolve, it becomes impractical to exhaustively retrain LLMs with new API knowledge. This limitation hampers LLMs from solving programming problems which require newly introduced or privately maintained libraries. Inspired by exploratory programming paradigm in human behavior, we propose ExploraCoder, a training-free framework that empowers LLMs to invoke multiple unseen APIs in code solution by (1) planning a complex problem into several API invocation subtasks, and (2) experimenting with correct API usage at intermediate steps through a novel chain-of-API-exploration. We conduct evaluation on program synthesizing tasks involving complex API interactions. Experimental results demonstrate that ExploraCoder significantly improves performance for models lacking prior API knowledge, achieving absolute increases of up to 11.99% over retrieval-based approaches and 17.28% over pretraining-based methods in pass@10.</p></details> |  |

However, current benchmarks lack a dedicated evaluation framework for this capability. To fill this gap, we introduce FEA-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform incremental development within code repositories. We collect pull requests from 83 GitHub repositories and use rule-based and intent-based filtering to construct task instances focused on new feature development. Each task instance containing code changes is paired with relevant unit test files to ensure that the solution can be verified. The feature implementation requires LLMs to simultaneously possess code completion capabilities for new components and code editing abilities for other relevant parts in the code repository, providing a more comprehensive evaluation method of LLMs' automated software engineering capabilities. Experimental results show that LLMs perform significantly worse in the FEA-Bench, highlighting considerable challenges in such repository-level incremental code development.</p></details> | <details><summary>V2, A...</summary><p>V2, Accepted by ACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |

As code generated by Large Language Models (LLMs) becomes more common, identifying the specific model behind each sample is increasingly important. This paper presents the first systematic study of LLM authorship attribution for C programs. We released CodeT5-Authorship, a novel model that uses only the encoder layers from the original CodeT5 encoder-decoder architecture, discarding the decoder to focus on classification. Our model's encoder output (first token) is passed through a two-layer classification head with GELU activation and dropout, producing a probability distribution over possible authors. To evaluate our approach, we introduce LLM-AuthorBench, a benchmark of 32,000 compilable C programs generated by eight state-of-the-art LLMs across diverse tasks. We compare our model to seven traditional ML classifiers and eight fine-tuned transformer models, including BERT, RoBERTa, CodeBERT, ModernBERT, DistilBERT, DeBERTa-V3, Longformer, and LoRA-fine-tuned Qwen2-1.5B. In binary classification, our model achieves 97.56% accuracy in distinguishing C programs generated by closely related models such as GPT-4.1 and GPT-4o, and 95.40% accuracy for multi-class attribution among five leading LLMs (Gemini 2.5 Flash, Claude 3.5 Haiku, GPT-4.1, Llama 3.3, and DeepSeek-V3). To support open science, we release the CodeT5-Authorship architecture, the LLM-AuthorBench benchmark, and all relevant Google Colab scripts on GitHub: https://github.com/LLMauthorbench/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code Rate Optimization via Neural Polar Decoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15836v1)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a method to optimize communication code rates via the application of neural polar decoders (NPDs). Employing this approach enables simultaneous optimization of code rates over input distributions while providing a practical coding scheme within the framework of polar codes. The proposed approach is designed for scenarios where the channel model is unknown, treating the channel as a black box that produces output samples from input samples. We employ polar codes to achieve our objectives, using NPDs to estimate mutual information (MI) between the channel inputs and outputs, and optimize a parametric model of the input distribution. The methodology involves a two-phase process: a training phase and an inference phase. In the training phase, two steps are repeated interchangeably. First, the estimation step estimates the MI of the channel inputs and outputs via NPDs. Second, the improvement step optimizes the input distribution parameters to maximize the MI estimate obtained by the NPDs. In the inference phase, the optimized model is used to construct polar codes. This involves incorporating the Honda-Yamamoto (HY) scheme to accommodate the optimized input distributions and list decoding to enhance decoding performance. Experimental results on memoryless and finite-state channels (FSCs) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, particularly in cases where the channel's capacity-achieving input distribution is non-uniform. For these cases, we show significant improvements in MI and bit error rates (BERs) over those achieved by uniform and independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) input distributions, validating our method for block lengths up to 1024. This scalable approach has potential applications in real-world communication systems, bridging theoretical capacity estimation and practical coding performance.</p></details> |  |

However, a critical yet underexplored aspect of RAG pipelines is chunking -- the process of dividing documents into retrievable units. Existing line-based chunking heuristics often break semantic structures, splitting functions or merging unrelated code, which can degrade generation quality. We propose chunking via Abstract Syntax Trees (\ourwork), a structure-aware method that recursively breaks large AST nodes into smaller chunks and merges sibling nodes while respecting size limits. This approach generates self-contained, semantically coherent units across programming languages and tasks, improving performance on diverse code generation tasks, e.g., boosting Recall@5 by 4.3 points on RepoEval retrieval and Pass@1 by 2.67 points on SWE-bench generation. Our work highlights the importance of structure-aware chunking for scaling retrieval-enhanced code intelligence.</p></details> |  |

However, this information-theoretic construction approach leads to a poor weight distribution. To address this issue, pre-transformed polar codes, such as CRC-polar codes and PAC codes, have been employed. In this paper, we focus on the structure of polar codes without applying any pre-transformations and explore methods, guided by the weight-contribution partial order, to design polar-like codes with enhanced weight distribution, notably without employing any search or optimization algorithms. Numerical results demonstrate improvement over a range of codes both with and without pre-transformation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and to be presented at IEEE ISIT'25</p></details> |

Examples include usage examples and other Application Programming Interfaces (APIs), which are especially important for third-party libraries. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), the key goal is to investigate the kinds of description developers commonly use and evaluate how well an LLM, in this case Llama, can support description generation. We use NPM Code Snippets, consisting of 185,412 packages with 1,024,579 code snippets. From there, we use 400 code snippets (and their descriptions) as samples. First, our manual classification found that the majority of original descriptions (55.5%) highlight example-based usage. This finding emphasizes the importance of clear documentation, as some descriptions lacked sufficient detail to convey intent. Second, the LLM correctly identified the majority of original descriptions as "Example" (79.75%), which is identical to our manual finding, showing a propensity for generalization. Third, compared to the originals, the produced description had an average similarity score of 0.7173, suggesting relevance but room for improvement. Scores below 0.9 indicate some irrelevance. Our results show that depending on the task of the code snippet, the intention of the document may differ from being instructions for usage, installations, or descriptive learning examples for any user of a library.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables, conference paper</p></details> |

Defect taxonomies are valuable tools for this, offering a common language for issues and enabling systematic tracking. A significant prior study developed such a taxonomy, but based it exclusively on the declarative language Puppet. It remained unknown whether this taxonomy applies to programming language-based IaC (PL-IaC) tools like Pulumi, Terraform CDK, and AWS CDK. Aim: We replicated this foundational work to assess the generalizability of the taxonomy across a broader and more diverse landscape. Method: We performed qualitative analysis on 3,364 defect-related commits from 285 open-source PL-IaC repositories (PIPr dataset) to derive a PL-IaC-specific defect taxonomy. We then enhanced the ACID tool, originally developed for the prior study, to automatically classify and analyze defect distributions across an expanded dataset-447 open-source repositories and 94 proprietary projects from VTEX (e-commerce) and Nubank (financial). Results: Our research confirmed the same eight defect categories identified in the original study, with idempotency and security defects appearing infrequently but persistently across projects. Configuration Data defects maintain high frequency in both open-source and proprietary codebases. Conclusions: Our replication supports the generalizability of the original taxonomy, suggesting IaC development challenges surpass organizational boundaries. Configuration Data defects emerge as a persistent high-frequency problem, while idempotency and security defects remain important concerns despite lower frequency. These patterns appear consistent across open-source and proprietary projects, indicating they are fundamental to the IaC paradigm itself, transcending specific tools or project types.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

This manuscript introduces a hardware-based methodology for detecting runtime HT activations using Error Correction Codes (ECCs) on a RISC-V microprocessor.

To counter this threat, the manuscript introduces a Hardware Security Checker (HSC) leveraging Hamming Single Error Correction (HSEC) architectures for effective HT detection. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed solution achieves a 100% detection rate for potential HT activations, with no false positives or undetected attacks.

Using Large Language Models for Coding German Open-Ended Survey Responses on Survey Motivation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14634v2)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development and wider accessibility of LLMs have spurred discussions about how they can be used in survey research, including classifying open-ended survey responses. Due to their linguistic capacities, it is possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual coding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models. As most existing research on this topic has focused on English-language responses relating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its findings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to established methods. In this study, we investigate to what extent different LLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using German data on reasons for survey participation as an example. We compare several state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate the LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. Overall performance differs greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory levels of predictive performance. Performance differences between prompting approaches are conditional on the LLM used. Finally, LLMs' unequal classification performance across different categories of reasons for survey participation results in different categorical distributions when not using fine-tuning. We discuss the implications of these findings, both for methodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their substantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively analyzing such data. Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need to consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response classification in the age of LLMs. In doing so, our study contributes to the growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be efficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in Survey Research Methods</p></details> |

Manual clinical coding is labour-intensive and error-prone, which has motivated research towards full automation of the process. However, our analysis, based on US English electronic health records and automated coding research using these records, shows that widely used evaluation methods are not aligned with real clinical contexts. For example, evaluations that focus on the top 50 most common codes are an oversimplification, as there are thousands of codes used in practice. This position paper aims to align AI coding research more closely with practical challenges of clinical coding.

The objective is to design codes with dynamic error-correcting capabilities that adapt to varying numbers of errors. Specifically, we first provide several bounds on the rate--distortion trade-off for general variable packet-error coding schemes. Then, we present two explicit constructions of variable packet-error coding schemes. The first construction uses higher-order MDS codes and provides a coding scheme that achieves a better rate--distortion trade-off compared to known results for general parameter regimes. The second construction is based on a variant of the repetition code and yields a coding scheme with an optimal rate--distortion trade-off, with respect to our bound, for certain parameter regimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 3 figures, part of the work in this paper has been accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory (ISIT)</p></details> |
| **[On de Bruijn Array Codes Part II: Linear Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12124v3)** | 2025-06-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An M-sequence generated by a primitive polynomial has many interesting and desirable properties. A pseudo-random array is the two-dimensional generalization of an M-sequence. Similarly to primitive polynomials, there are irreducible and reducible polynomials whose all nonzero sequences have the same length. In this paper, a two-dimensional generalization for such sequences is given. This generalization is for a pseudo-random array code which is a set of $r_1 \times r_2$ arrays in which each $n_1 \times n_2$ nonzero matrix is contained exactly once as a window in one of the arrays. Moreover, these arrays have the shift-and-add property, i.e., the bitwise addition of two arrays (or a nontrivial shift of such arrays) is another array (or a shift of another array) from the code. All the known arrays can be formed by folding sequences generated from an irreducible polynomial or a reducible polynomial whose factors have the same degree and the same exponent. Two proof techniques are used to prove the parameters of the constructed arrays. The first one is based on another method, different from folding, for constructing some of these arrays. The second one is a generalization of a known proof technique. This generalization enables to present pseudo-random arrays with parameters not known before and also a variety of pseudo-random array codes which cannot be generated by the first method. The two techniques also suggest two different hierarchies between pseudo-random array codes. Finally, two methods to verify whether a folding of sequences, generated by these polynomials, yields a pseudo-random array or a pseudo-random array code, will be presented.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose a family of constructions for full flag codes based on partial spreads. The distances of this family include maximum distance (optimum distance flag codes), second-maximum distance (quasi-optimum distance flag codes), as well as other feasible values. The structure of these flag codes resembles that of a \textquotedblleft sandwich", consisting of one layer of companion matrix and two layers of partial spreads. Furthermore, we present an efficient decoding algorithm for these codes.</p></details> | 24 pages |

This limitation, stemming from static pre-training datasets, often results in non-executable code or implementations with suboptimal safety and efficiency. To this end, this paper introduces CODESYNC, a data engine for identifying outdated code patterns and collecting real-time code knowledge updates from Python third-party libraries. Building upon CODESYNC, we develop CODESYNCBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' ability to stay synchronized with code evolution, which covers real-world updates for 220 APIs from six Python libraries. Our benchmark offers 3,300 test cases across three evaluation tasks and an update-aware instruction tuning dataset consisting of 2,200 training samples. Extensive experiments on 14 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that they struggle with dynamic code evolution, even with the support of advanced knowledge updating methods (e.g., DPO, ORPO, and SimPO). We believe that our benchmark can offer a strong foundation for the development of more effective methods for real-time code knowledge updating in the future. The experimental code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/Lucky-voyage/Code-Sync.</p></details> |  |

This codebook is used in a ``black-box'' manner, and is only assumed to operate at an achievable rate in the sense of attaining asymptotically vanishing maximal (inner) error probability. We first derive the exact error exponent in a widely-studied regime of constant rate and a linear number of sequencing reads, and show strict improvements over an existing achievable error exponent. Moreover, our achievability analysis is based on a coded-index strategy, implying that such strategies attain the highest error exponents within the broader class of codes that we consider. We then extend our results to other scaling regimes, including a super-linear number of reads, as well as several certain low-rate regimes. We find that the latter comes with notable intricacies, such as the suboptimality of codewords with all distinct molecules, and certain dependencies of the error exponents on the model for sequencing errors.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |

Using proprietary intellectual property (IP) for FT presents a serious risk, as FT data can be leaked through LLM inference. This leads to a critical dilemma for design houses: seeking to build externally accessible LLMs offering competitive Verilog coding, how can they leverage in-house IP to enhance FT utility while ensuring IP protection? For the first time in the literature, we study this dilemma. Using LLaMA 3.1-8B, we conduct in-house FT on a baseline Verilog dataset (RTLCoder) supplemented with our own in-house IP, which is validated through multiple tape-outs. To rigorously assess IP leakage, we quantify structural similarity (AST/Dolos) and functional equivalence (Synopsys Formality) between generated codes and our in-house IP. We show that our IP can indeed be leaked, confirming the threat. As defense, we evaluate logic locking of Verilog codes (ASSURE). This offers some level of protection, yet reduces the IP's utility for FT and degrades the LLM's performance. Our study shows the need for novel strategies that are both effective and minimally disruptive to FT, an essential effort for enabling design houses to fully utilize their proprietary IP toward LLM-driven Verilog coding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Predicting the Understandability of Computational Notebooks through Code Metrics Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10989v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational notebooks are the primary coding tools for data scientists, but their code quality remains understudied and often poor. Given the importance of maintainability and reusability, enhancing code understandability is essential. Traditional methods for assessing understandability typically rely on limited questionnaires or metadata like likes and votes, which may not reflect actual code clarity. To address this, we propose a novel approach that leverages user opinions from software repositories to assess the understandability of Jupyter notebooks. We conducted a case study using 542,051 Kaggle Jupyter notebooks compiled in the DistilKaggle dataset. To identify user comments related to code understandability, we used a fine-tuned DistilBERT transformer. We then introduced a new metric, i.e., User Opinion Code Understandability (UOCU), based on the number of relevant comments, their upvotes, and notebook views. UOCU proved significantly more effective than prior methods. We further enhanced it by combining UOCU with total upvotes in a hybrid approach. Using this improved metric, we collected 34 notebook-level metrics from 132,723 final notebooks and trained machine learning models to predict understandability. Our best model, a Random Forest classifier, achieved 89% accuracy in classifying the understandability level of notebook code. This work demonstrates the value of user opinion signals and notebook metrics in building scalable, accurate measures of code understandability.</p></details> |  |

While iterative UF improves performance at moderate error rates, it lacks an error correction guarantee. To address this, we develop UIUF, which maintains the enhanced performance of iterative UF while ensuring error correction up to half the code distance. Through simulations under code capacity, phenomenological, and biased noise models, we show that UIUF significantly outperforms UF, reducing the logical error rate by over an order of magnitude (at around $10^{-5}$). Moreover, UIUF achieves lower logical error rates than the Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder on rotated surface codes under both the code capacity and phenomenological noise models, while preserving efficient linear-time complexity.</p></details> | 13 pages, 17 figures |

Evaluating their effectiveness and further suggesting optimization opportunities often rely on high-quality tests to demonstrate the performance bottlenecks presented in the program. However, existing approaches rely on a limited set of hand-curated inputs or LLM-generated uninteresting length-stressing tests, failing to reveal more nuanced optimization opportunities. We present WEDGE, a framework for generating performance-stressing input given the program under test. WEDGE synthesizes explicit performance-characterizing constraints in the form of branch conditions to partition the programs' execution space into performance-specific regions. When integrated with the coverage-guided fuzzer, reaching different regions introduces explicit rewards for test generation to explore inefficient implementations. Our evaluation shows that WEDGE introduces a significant slowdown compared to the tests in CodeContests and those claimed to be optimized by existing approaches. From the utility perspective, integrating our tests substantially improves the existing code optimization approaches that rely on test-driven execution feedback. We release PERFFORGE, the performance tests generated by WEDGE, to benchmark future approaches for efficient code generation at https://github.com/UChiSeclab/perfforge.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |

Unfortunately, because compilation is lossy, deterministic decompilers produce code that is missing many of the details that make source code readable in the first place, like variable names and types. Neural decompilers, on the other hand, offer the ability to statistically fill in these details. Existing work in neural decompilation, however, suffers from substantial limitations that preclude its use on real code, such as the inability to define composite types, which is essential to fully specify function semantics. In this work, we introduce a new dataset, Realtype, that includes substantially more complicated and realistic types than existing neural decompilation benchmarks, and Idioms, a new neural decompilation approach to finetune any LLM into a neural decompiler capable of generating the appropriate user-defined type definitions alongside the decompiled code. We show that our approach yields state-of-the-art results in neural decompilation. On the most challenging existing benchmark, ExeBench, our model achieves 54.4% accuracy vs. 46.3% for LLM4Decompile and 37.5% for Nova; on Realtype, our model performs at least 95% better.</p></details> |  |

However, how to minimize hallucinations in the generated comments remains significant challenges. In this paper, we propose IsComment, an issue-based LLM retrieval and verification approach for generating method's design rationale, usage directives, and so on as supplementary code comments. We first identify five main types of code supplementary information that issue reports can provide through code-comment-issue analysis. Next, we retrieve issue sentences containing these types of supplementary information and generate candidate code comments. To reduce hallucinations, we filter out those candidate comments that are irrelevant to the code or unverifiable by the issue report, making the code comment generation results more reliable. Our experiments indicate that compared with LLMs, IsComment increases the coverage of manual supplementary comments from 33.6% to 72.2% for ChatGPT, from 35.8% to 88.4% for GPT-4o, and from 35.0% to 86.2% for DeepSeek-V3. Compared with existing work, IsComment can generate richer and more useful supplementary code comments for programming understanding, which is quantitatively evaluated through the MESIA metric on both methods with and without manual code comments.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |

Eleven cities in nine countries will deploy in real conditions products and services fostering climate transition in their local environment. The Climaborough City Platform is being developed to monitor the cities' overall progress towards their climate goals by aggregating historic and real-time data and displaying the results in user-friendly dashboards that will be used by non-technical experts to evaluate the effectiveness of local experimental initiatives, identify those that yield significant impact, and assess the potential consequences of scaling them up to a broader level. In this paper, we explain how we have put in place a low-code/no-code strategy in Climaborough in response to the project's aim to quickly deploy climate dashboards. A low-code strategy is used to accelerate the development of the dashboards. The dashboards embed a no-code philosophy that enables all types of citizen profiles to configure and adapt the dashboard to their specific needs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was presented in the Research Projects Track of the 19th International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science (RCIS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Automatic Qiskit Code Refactoring Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14535v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As quantum software frameworks evolve, developers face increasing challenges in maintaining compatibility with rapidly changing APIs. In this work, we present a novel methodology for refactoring Qiskit code using large language models (LLMs). We begin by extracting a taxonomy of migration scenarios from the different sources of official Qiskit documentation (such as release notes), capturing common patterns such as migration of functionality to different modules and deprecated usage. This taxonomy, along with the original Python source code, is provided as input to an LLM, which is then tasked with identifying instances of migration scenarios in the code and suggesting appropriate refactoring solutions. Our approach is designed to address the context length limitations of current LLMs by structuring the input and reasoning process in a targeted, efficient manner. The results demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by domain-specific migration knowledge, can effectively assist in automating Qiskit code migration. This work contributes both a set of proven prompts and taxonomy for Qiskit code migration from earlier versions to version 0.46 and a methodology to asses the capabilities of LLMs to assist in the migration of quantum code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for review to "Taller Latinoamericano de Ingenier\'ia de Software Cu\'antico" (https://www.ripaisc.net/call-for-papers-tlisc-2025/)</p></details> |

The Surprising Impact of Hybrid Graph Representations on Code Clone Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14470v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As one of the most detrimental code smells, code clones significantly increase software maintenance costs and heighten vulnerability risks, making their detection a critical challenge in software engineering. Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) dominate deep learning-based code clone detection due to their precise syntactic structure representation, but they inherently lack semantic depth. Recent studies address this by enriching AST-based representations with semantic graphs, such as Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) and Data Flow Graphs (DFGs). However, the effectiveness of various enriched AST-based representations and their compatibility with different graph-based machine learning techniques remains an open question, warranting further investigation to unlock their full potential in addressing the complexities of code clone detection. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of AST-based hybrid graph representations in Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based code clone detection. We systematically compare various hybrid representations ((CFG, DFG, Flow-Augmented ASTs (FA-AST)) across multiple GNN architectures. Our experiments reveal that hybrid representations impact GNNs differently: while AST+CFG+DFG consistently enhances accuracy for convolution- and attention-based models (Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT)), FA-AST frequently introduces structural complexity that harms performance. Notably, GMN outperforms others even with standard AST representations, highlighting its superior cross-code similarity detection and reducing the need for enriched structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[MALSIGHT: Exploring Malicious Source Code and Benign Pseudocode for Iterative Binary Malware Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18379v3)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary malware summarization aims to automatically generate human-readable descriptions of malware behaviors from executable files, facilitating tasks like malware cracking and detection. Previous methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise. However, they still face significant issues, including poor usability, inaccurate explanations,and incomplete summaries, primarily due to the obscure pseudocode structure and the lack of malware training summaries. Further, calling relationships between functions, which involve the rich interactions within a binary malware, remain largely underexplored. To this end, we propose MALSIGHT, a novel code summarization framework that can iteratively generate descriptions of binary malware by exploring malicious source code and benign pseudocode. Specifically, we construct the first malware summary dataset, MalS and MalP, using an LLM and manually refine this dataset with human effort. At the training stage, we tune our proposed MalT5, a novel LLM-based code model, on the MalS and benign pseudocode datasets. Then, at the test stage, we iteratively feed the pseudocode functions into MalT5 to obtain the summary. Such a procedure facilitates the understanding of pseudocode structure and captures the intricate interactions between functions, thereby benefiting summaries' usability, accuracy, and completeness. Additionally, we propose a novel evaluation benchmark, BLEURT-sum, to measure the quality of summaries. Experiments on three datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed MALSIGHT. Notably, our proposed MalT5, with only 0.77B parameters, delivers comparable performance to much larger Code-Llama.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics & Security</p></details> |

Prior work generates synthetic audio from text, but these methods are computationally intensive and hard to scale. We introduce AsyncSwitch, a novel asynchronous adaptation framework that leverages large-scale, text-rich web data to pre-expose ASR models to diverse code-switched domains before fine-tuning on paired speech-text corpora. Our three-stage process (1) trains decoder self-attention and feedforward layers on code-switched text, (2) aligns decoder and encoder via cross-attention using limited speech-text data, and (3) fully fine-tunes the entire model.

This study investigates building CS-ASR using synthetic CS data. We propose a phrase-level mixing method to generate synthetic CS data that mimics natural patterns.

This paper focuses on three under-resourced Southeast Asian language pairs: Malay-English (BM-EN), Mandarin-Malay (ZH-BM), and Tamil-English (TA-EN), establishing a new comprehensive benchmark for CS-ASR to evaluate the performance of leading ASR models. Experimental results show that the proposed training strategy enhances ASR performance on monolingual and CS tests, with BM-EN showing highest gains, then TA-EN and ZH-BM. This finding offers a cost-effective approach for CS-ASR development, benefiting research and industry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech 2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Reconciliation of Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution with Multiplicatively Repeated Non-Binary LDPC Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11009v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous variable quantum key distribution bears the promise of simple quantum key distribution directly compatible with commercial off the shelf equipment. However, for a long time its performance was hindered by the absence of good classical postprocessing capable of distilling secret-keys in the noisy regime. Advanced coding solutions in the past years have partially addressed this problem enabling record transmission distances of up to 165 km, and 206 km over ultra-low loss fiber. In this paper, we show that a very simple coding solution with a single code is sufficient to extract keys at all noise levels. This solution has performance competitive with prior results for all levels of noise, and we show that non-zero keys can be distilled up to a record distance of 192 km assuming the standard loss of a single-mode optical fiber, and 240 km over ultra-low loss fibers. Low-rate codes are constructed using multiplicatively repeated non-binary low-density parity-check codes over a finite field of characteristic two. This construction only makes use of a (2,k)-regular non-binary low-density parity-check code as mother code, such that code design is in fact not required, thus trivializing the code construction procedure. The construction is also inherently rate-adaptive thereby allowing to easily create codes of any rate. Rate-adaptive codes are of special interest for the efficient reconciliation of errors over time or arbitrary varying channels, as is the case with quantum key distribution. In short, these codes are highly efficient when reconciling errors over a very noisy communication channel, and perform well even for short block-length codes. Finally, the proposed solution is known to be easily amenable to hardware implementations, thus addressing also the requirements for practical reconciliation in continuous variable quantum key distribution.</p></details> | 31 pages, 12 figures |

This phenomenon is widespread in multilingual communities, and increasingly prevalent in online content, where users naturally mix languages in everyday communication. As a result, Large Language Models (LLMs), now central to content processing and generation, are frequently exposed to code-switched inputs. Given their widespread use, it is crucial to understand how LLMs process and reason about such mixed-language text. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of LLM comprehension under code-switching by generating CSW variants of established reasoning and comprehension benchmarks. While degradation is evident when foreign tokens disrupt English text$\unicode{x2013}$even under linguistic constraints$\unicode{x2013}$embedding English into other languages often improves comprehension. Though prompting yields mixed results, fine-tuning offers a more stable path to degradation mitigation.</p></details> |  |

However, most high-performing methods such as neural networks and ensemble methods are often opaque, limiting trust and broader adoption. In parallel, symbolic methods like Answer Set Programming (ASP) offer the possibility of interpretable logical rules but do not always match the predictive power of ML models. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that integrates ASP-derived rules from the FOLD-R++ algorithm with black-box ML classifiers to selectively correct uncertain predictions and provide human-readable explanations. Experiments on five medical datasets reveal statistically significant performance gains in accuracy and F1 score. This study underscores the potential of combining symbolic reasoning with conventional ML to achieve high interpretability without sacrificing accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication as a Technical Communication at ICLP 2025</p></details> |

This study explores the possibility of automating and accelerating this task using Generative AI based on Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, the most popular LLM, i.e., ChatGPT, is used to test the ability to generate MATLAB codes for four classical reliability algorithms. The four specific examples considered in this study are: (1) First Order Reliability Method (FORM); (2) Subset simulation; (3) Random field simulation; and (4) Bayesian update using Gibbs sampling. The results obtained using the generated codes are compared with benchmark methods. It is found that the use of LLMs can be promising for generating reliability codes. Failure, limitations, and challenges of adopting LLMs are also discussed. Overall, this study demonstrates that existing LLMs can be leveraged powerfully and can contribute toward accelerating the adoption of reliability techniques in routine geotechnical engineering.</p></details> |  |

As modern systems grow in complexity, knowledge sharing and collaboration across teams have become essential. However, despite well-documented benefits of PP, its adoption remains inconsistent across software teams. Objective: This study aims to understand the factors that facilitate or hinder team members' adoption as well as lasting engagement in PP. Method: We have conducted an exploratory single-case study in a mature agile company in Norway. We collected data through two rounds of interviews with team members in different roles and performed a thematic analysis of the interviews. Results: Our key finding is that multiple factors, related to the perceptions of how PP contributes to daily work, efforts associated with engaging in PP sessions, company and team attitudes, resources, infrastructure, and task characteristics, affect PP engagement. Conclusion: Long-term engagement in PP requires expected benefits with the practice being confirmed in firsthand experiences. Adapting the practice to each unique team, with insights drawn from collective learning, is also beneficial. Our findings will be beneficial for software practitioners seeking to make PP an integrated part of their team's workflow.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The pre-print is submitted to the Journal of Systems and Software</p></details> |
| **[The Elements of Differentiable Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14606v3)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence has recently experienced remarkable advances, fueled by large models, vast datasets, accelerated hardware, and, last but not least, the transformative power of differentiable programming. This new programming paradigm enables end-to-end differentiation of complex computer programs (including those with control flows and data structures), making gradient-based optimization of program parameters possible. As an emerging paradigm, differentiable programming builds upon several areas of computer science and applied mathematics, including automatic differentiation, graphical models, optimization and statistics. This book presents a comprehensive review of the fundamental concepts useful for differentiable programming. We adopt two main perspectives, that of optimization and that of probability, with clear analogies between the two. Differentiable programming is not merely the differentiation of programs, but also the thoughtful design of programs intended for differentiation. By making programs differentiable, we inherently introduce probability distributions over their execution, providing a means to quantify the uncertainty associated with program outputs.</p></details> | Draft version 3 |
| **[Total Outcome Logic: Unified Reasoning for a Taxonomy of Program Logics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00197v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While there is a long tradition of reasoning about (non)termination in program analysis, specialized logics are typically needed to give different termination criteria. This includes partial correctness, where termination is not guaranteed, and total correctness, where it is guaranteed. We present Total Outcome Logic (TOL), a single logic which can express the full spectrum of termination conditions and program properties offered by the aforementioned logics. TOL extends (non)termination and (in)correctness reasoning across different kinds of branching effects, so that a single metatheory powers this reasoning in different kinds of programs, including nondeterministic and probabilistic. We also show that TOL subsumes several recently created taxonomies of (in)correctness logics, so that many different kinds of properties can be proven with a single unified theory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Programming by Backprop: LLMs Acquire Reusable Algorithmic Abstractions During Code Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18777v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models (LLMs) on source code significantly enhances their general-purpose reasoning abilities, but the mechanisms underlying this generalisation are poorly understood. In this paper, we propose Programming by Backprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to evaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without ever seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of programs representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source code and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We find evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for inputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations. Firstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code rather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can produce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the program within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the program in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more robust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn from a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest a mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to internalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for future work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures, and progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by training on formal constitutional principles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semidefinite Programming for the Asymmetric Stochastic Block Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18754v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider semidefinite programming (SDP) for the binary stochastic block model with equal-sized communities. Prior work of Hajek, Wu, and Xu proposed an SDP (sym-SDP) for the symmetric case where the intra-community edge probabilities are equal, and showed that the SDP achieves the information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery under the symmetry assumption. A key open question is whether SDPs can be used to achieve exact recovery for non-symmetric block models. In order to inform the design of a new SDP for the non-symmetric setting, we investigate the failure of sym-SDP when it is applied to non-symmetric settings. We formally show that sym-SDP fails to return the correct labeling of the vertices in some information-theoretically feasible, asymmetric cases. In addition, we give an intuitive geometric interpretation of the failure of sym-SDP in asymmetric settings, which in turn suggests an SDP formulation to handle the asymmetric setting. Still, this new SDP cannot be readily analyzed by existing techniques, suggesting a fundamental limitation in the design of SDPs for community detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bloch Vector Assertions for Debugging Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18458v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum programs must be reliable to ensure trustworthy results, yet debugging them is notoriously challenging due to quantum-specific faults like gate misimplementations and hardware noise, as well as their inherently probabilistic nature. Assertion-based debugging provides a promising solution by enabling localized correctness checks during execution. However, current approaches face challenges including manual assertion generation, reliance on mid-circuit-measurements, and poor scalability. In this paper, we present Bloq, a scalable, automated fault localization approach introducing Bloch-vector-based assertions utilizing expectation value measurements of Pauli operators, enabling low-overhead fault localization without mid-circuit measurements. In addition, we introduce AutoBloq, a component of Bloq for automatically generating assertion schemes from quantum algorithms. An experimental evaluation over 684432 programs using two algorithms (Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Grover) shows that Bloq consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approach Proq, notably as circuit depth and noise increase. For Grover, Bloq achieves a mean F1 score across all experimental instances of 0.74 versus 0.38 for Proq under ideal conditions, and maintains performance under noise (0.43 versus 0.06). Bloq also reduces Proq's runtime by a factor of 5 and circuit depth overhead by a factor of 23. These results underline Bloq's potential to make assertion-based debugging scalable and effective for near-term quantum devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal Submission, 40 pages</p></details> |

HDC programs are often manually written in low-level and target specific languages targeting CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs -- these codes cannot be easily retargeted onto HDC-specific accelerators. No previous programming system enables productive development of HDC programs and generates efficient code for several hardware targets. We propose a heterogeneous programming system for HDC: a novel programming language, HDC++, for writing applications using a unified programming model, including HDC-specific primitives to improve programmability, and a heterogeneous compiler, HPVM-HDC, that provides an intermediate representation for compiling HDC programs to many hardware targets. We implement two tuning optimizations, automatic binarization and reduction perforation, that exploit the error resilient nature of HDC. Our evaluation shows that HPVM-HDC generates performance-competitive code for CPUs and GPUs, achieving a geomean speed-up of 1.17x over optimized baseline CUDA implementations with a geomean reduction in total lines of code of 1.6x across CPUs and GPUs. Additionally, HPVM-HDC targets an HDC Digital ASIC and an HDC ReRAM accelerator simulator, enabling the first execution of HDC applications on these devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Planning for Heterogeneous Robot Teams using Dynamic Topological Graphs and Mixed-Integer Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08396v5)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot planning and coordination in uncertain environments is a fundamental computational challenge, since the belief space increases exponentially with the number of robots. In this paper, we address the problem of planning in uncertain environments with a heterogeneous robot team of fast scout vehicles for information gathering and more risk-averse carrier robots from which the scouts vehicles are deployed. To overcome the computational challenges, we represent the environment and operational scenario using a topological graph, where the parameters of the edge weight distributions vary with the state of the robot team on the graph, and we formulate a computationally efficient mixed-integer program which removes the dependence on the number of robots from its decision space. Our formulation results in the capability to generate optimal multi-robot, long-horizon plans in seconds that could otherwise be computationally intractable. Ultimately our approach enables real-time re-planning, since the computation time is significantly faster than the time to execute one step. We evaluate our algorithm in a scenario where the robot team must traverse an environment while minimizing detection by observers in positions that are uncertain to the robot team. We demonstrate that our method is computationally tractable, can improve performance in the presence of imperfect information, and can be adjusted for different risk profiles.</p></details> | <details><summary>\copy...</summary><p>\copyright 2025 IEEE.

In this regard, emerging RRAMs have attracted considerable interest for their unique qualities like low power consumption, high integration potential, durability, and CMOS compatibility. Using RRAMs to imitate the more analog storage behavior of brain synapses is also a promising strategy for further improving memory density and power efficiency. However, RRAM devices display strong stochastic behavior, together with relaxation effects, making it more challenging to precisely control their multi-level storage capability. To address this, researchers have reported different multi-level programming strategies, mostly involving the precise control of analog parameters like compliance current during write operations and/or programming voltage amplitudes. Here, we present a new fully digital relaxation-aware method for tuning the conductance of analog RRAMs. The method is based on modulating digital pulse widths during erase operations while keeping other parameters fixed, and therefore requires no precise alterations to analog parameters like compliance currents or programming voltage amplitudes. Experimental results, with and without relaxation effect awareness, on a 64 RRAM 1T1R HfOx memory array of cells, fabricated in 130nm CMOS technology, indicate that it is possible to obtain 2-bit memory per cell multi-value storage at the array level, verified 1000 seconds after programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Adversarial Reasoning for Repair Based on Inferred Program Intent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13008v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has shown promising results, particularly with the use of neural networks. Currently, most APR tools focus on code transformations specified by test suites, rather than reasoning about the program intent and the high-level bug specification. Without a proper understanding of program intent, these tools tend to generate patches that overfit incomplete test suites and fail to reflect the developers intentions. However, reasoning about program intent is challenging. In our work, we propose an approach called AdverIntent-Agent, based on critique and adversarial reasoning. Our approach is novel to shift the focus from generating multiple APR patches to inferring multiple potential program intents. Ideally, we aim to infer intents that are, to some extent, adversarial to each other, maximizing the probability that at least one aligns closely with the developers original intent. AdverIntent-Agent is a multi-agent approach consisting of three agents: a reasoning agent, a test agent, and a repair agent. First, the reasoning agent generates adversarial program intents along with the corresponding faulty statements. Next, the test agent produces adversarial test cases that align with each inferred intent, constructing oracles that use the same inputs but have different expected outputs. Finally, the repair agent uses dynamic and precise LLM prompts to generate patches that satisfy both the inferred program intent and the generated tests. AdverIntent-Agent was evaluated on two benchmarks: Defects4J 2.0 and HumanEval-Java. AdverIntent-Agent correctly repaired 77 and 105 bugs in both benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, students without prior programming experience may find these courses challenging, leading to difficulties in understanding concepts and engaging in academic dishonesty such as plagiarism. While there exists plagiarism detection techniques and tools, not all of them are suitable for academic settings, especially in introductory programming courses. This paper introduces PasteTrace, a novel open-source plagiarism detection tool designed specifically for introductory programming courses. Unlike traditional methods, PasteTrace operates within an Integrated Development Environment that tracks the student's coding activities in real-time for evidence of plagiarism. Our evaluation of PasteTrace in two introductory programming courses demonstrates the tool's ability to provide insights into student behavior and detect various forms of plagiarism, outperforming an existing well-established tool.

| **[SemAgent: A Semantics Aware Program Repair Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16650v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive capabilities in downstream software engineering tasks such as Automated Program Repair (APR). In particular, there has been a lot of research on repository-level issue-resolution benchmarks such as SWE-Bench. Although there has been significant progress on this topic, we notice that in the process of solving such issues, existing agentic systems tend to hyper-localize on immediately suspicious lines of code and fix them in isolation, without a deeper understanding of the issue semantics, code semantics, or execution semantics. Consequently, many existing systems generate patches that overfit to the user issue, even when a more general fix is preferable. To address this limitation, we introduce SemAgent, a novel workflow-based procedure that leverages issue, code, and execution semantics to generate patches that are complete - identifying and fixing all lines relevant to the issue. We achieve this through a novel pipeline that (a) leverages execution semantics to retrieve relevant context, (b) comprehends issue-semantics via generalized abstraction, (c) isolates code-semantics within the context of this abstraction, and (d) leverages this understanding in a two-stage architecture: a repair stage that proposes fine-grained fixes, followed by a reviewer stage that filters relevant fixes based on the inferred issue-semantics. Our evaluations show that our methodology achieves a solve rate of 44.66% on the SWEBench-Lite benchmark beating all other workflow-based approaches, and an absolute improvement of 7.66% compared to our baseline, which lacks such deep semantic understanding. We note that our approach performs particularly well on issues requiring multi-line reasoning (and editing) and edge-case handling, suggesting that incorporating issue and code semantics into APR pipelines can lead to robust and semantically consistent repairs.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Generation to Adaptation: Comparing AI-Assisted Strategies in High School Programming Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.15955v1)** | 2025-06-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This exploratory case study investigated two contrasting pedagogical approaches for LCA-assisted programming with five novice high school students preparing for a WeChat Mini Program competition. In Phase 1, students used LCAs to generate code from abstract specifications (From-Scratch approach), achieving only 20% MVP completion. In Phase 2, students adapted existing Minimal Functional Units (MFUs), small, functional code examples, using LCAs, achieving 100% MVP completion. Analysis revealed that the MFU-based approach succeeded by aligning with LCA strengths in pattern modification rather than de novo generation, while providing cognitive scaffolds that enabled students to navigate complex development tasks. The study introduces a dual-scaffolding model combining technical support (MFUs) with pedagogical guidance (structured prompting strategies), demonstrating that effective LCA integration depends less on AI capabilities than on instructional design. These findings offer practical guidance for educators seeking to transform AI tools from sources of frustration into productive learning partners in programming education.</p></details> |  |

Supporting multilingual programming -- i.e., coding tasks across multiple programming languages -- typically requires either (1) finetuning a single LLM across all programming languages, which is cost-efficient but sacrifices language-specific specialization and performance, or (2) finetuning separate LLMs for each programming language, which allows for specialization but is computationally expensive and storage-intensive due to the duplication of parameters. This paper introduces MoLE (Mix-of-Language-Experts), a novel architecture that balances efficiency and specialization for multilingual programming. MoLE is composed of a base model, a shared LoRA (low-rank adaptation) module, and a collection of language-specific LoRA modules. These modules are jointly optimized during the finetuning process, enabling effective knowledge sharing and specialization across programming languages. During inference, MoLE automatically routes to the language-specific LoRA module corresponding to the programming language of the code token being generated. Our experiments demonstrate that MoLE achieves greater parameter efficiency compared to training separate language-specific LoRAs, while outperforming a single shared LLM finetuned for all programming languages in terms of accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at LLM4Code @ ICSE 2025</p></details> |

Traditional fuzzing evaluations typically focus on overall fuzzer performance across a set of target programs, yet few benchmarks consider how fine-grained program features influence fuzzing effectiveness. To bridge this gap, we introduce a novel benchmark designed to generate programs with configurable, fine-grained program features to enhance fuzzing evaluations. We reviewed 25 recent grey-box fuzzing studies, extracting 7 program features related to control-flow and data-flow that can impact fuzzer performance. Using these features, we generated a benchmark consisting of 153 programs controlled by 10 fine-grained configurable parameters. We evaluated 11 popular fuzzers using this benchmark. The results indicate that fuzzer performance varies significantly based on the program features and their strengths, highlighting the importance of incorporating program characteristics into fuzzing evaluations.</p></details> |  |

This is due to the promise of revolutionary speedups, where achieving such speedup requires designing an algorithm that harnesses the structure of a problem using quantum mechanics. Yet many quantum programming languages today require programmers to reason at a low level of physics notation and quantum gate circuitry. This presents a significant barrier to entry for programmers who have not yet built up an intuition about quantum gate semantics, and it can prove to be tedious even for those who have. In this paper, we present Qwerty, a new quantum programming language that allows programmers to manipulate qubits more expressively than gates and trace programs without bra-ket notation. Due to its novel basis type and easy interoperability with Python, Qwerty is a powerful framework for high-level quantum-classical computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 38 figures; revised syntax and examples, added program-tracing figures</p></details> |

Not surprisingly, with the advent of quantum information processing, a major research path has emerged, aiming to minimize the requirements necessary to achieve OT by leveraging quantum resources, while also exploring the implications for secure computation. Indeed, OT has been the target of renewed focus regarding its newfound quantum possibilities (and impossibilities), both towards its computation and communication complexity. For instance, non-interactive OT, known to be impossible classically, has been strongly pursued. In its most extreme form, non-interactive chosen-input OT (one-shot OT) is equivalent to a One-Time Memory (OTM). OTMs have been proposed as tamper-proof hardware solutions for constructing One-Time Programs -- single-use programs that execute on an arbitrary input without revealing anything about their internal workings. In this work, we leverage quantum resources in the Noisy-Quantum-Storage Model to achieve: 1. Unconditionally-secure two-message non-interactive OT -- the smallest number of messages known to date for unconditionally-secure chosen-input OT. 2. Computationally-secure one-shot OT/OTM, with everlasting security, assuming only one-way functions and sequential functions -- without requiring trusted hardware, QROM, or pre-shared entanglement. 3. One-Time Programs without the need for hardware-based solutions or QROM, by compiling our OTM construction with the [GKR08, GIS+10] compiler.</p></details> | <details><summary>Title...</summary><p>Title and paper changed to include OTM/OTP results.

| **[GenerationPrograms: Fine-grained Attribution with Executable Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14580v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance in source-conditioned text generation but often fail to correctly provide fine-grained attributions for their outputs, undermining verifiability and trust. Moreover, existing attribution methods do not explain how and why models leverage the provided source documents to generate their final responses, limiting interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a modular generation framework, GenerationPrograms, inspired by recent advancements in executable "code agent" architectures. Unlike conventional generation methods that simultaneously generate outputs and attributions or rely on post-hoc attribution, GenerationPrograms decomposes the process into two distinct stages: first, creating an executable program plan composed of modular text operations (such as paraphrasing, compression, and fusion) explicitly tailored to the query, and second, executing these operations following the program's specified instructions to produce the final response. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that GenerationPrograms significantly improves attribution quality at both the document level and sentence level across two long-form question-answering tasks and a multi-document summarization task. We further demonstrate that GenerationPrograms can effectively function as a post-hoc attribution method, outperforming traditional techniques in recovering accurate attributions. In addition, the interpretable programs generated by GenerationPrograms enable localized refinement through modular-level improvements that further enhance overall attribution quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 Pa...</summary><p>27 Pages.

| **[Learning Traffic Signal Control via Genetic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17328v3)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The control of traffic signals is crucial for improving transportation efficiency. Recently, learning-based methods, especially Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), garnered substantial success in the quest for more efficient traffic signal control strategies. However, the design of rewards in DRL highly demands domain knowledge to converge to an effective policy, and the final policy also presents difficulties in terms of explainability. In this work, a new learning-based method for signal control in complex intersections is proposed. In our approach, we design a concept of phase urgency for each signal phase. During signal transitions, the traffic light control strategy selects the next phase to be activated based on the phase urgency. We then proposed to represent the urgency function as an explainable tree structure. The urgency function can calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. Genetic programming is adopted to perform gradient-free optimization of the urgency function. We test our algorithm on multiple public traffic signal control datasets. The experimental results indicate that the tree-shaped urgency function evolved by genetic programming outperforms the baselines, including a state-of-the-art method in the transportation field and a well-known DRL-based method. Our code is available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Teacher's Dilemma: Balancing Trade-Offs in Programming Education for Emergent Bilingual Students](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14147v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>K-12 computing teachers must navigate complex trade-offs when selecting programming languages and instructional materials for classrooms with emergent bilingual students. While they aim to foster an inclusive learning environment by addressing language barriers that impact student engagement, they must also align with K-12 computer science curricular guidelines and prepare students for industry-standard programming tools. Because programming languages predominantly use English keywords and most instructional materials are written in English, these linguistic barriers introduce cognitive load and accessibility challenges. This paper examines teachers' decisions in balancing these competing priorities, highlighting the tensions between accessibility, curriculum alignment, and workforce preparation. The findings shed light on how our teacher participants negotiate these trade-offs and what factors influence their selection of programming tools to best support EB students while meeting broader educational and professional goals.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeImprove: Program Adaptation for Deep Code Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15804v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging deep learning (DL)-based code analysis tools to solve software engineering tasks is becoming increasingly popular. Code models often suffer performance degradation due to various reasons (e.g., code data shifts). Retraining is often required to address these issues, but frequent model updates are costly in labeling and deployment. In this paper, we explore an alternative solution: Adapting the program inputs to the code models. This can be achieved by two steps: 1) input validation that focuses on identifying whether an input is an out-of-scope input program that are beyond a model's handling capability, and 2) input adaptation that adapts out-of-scope inputs to become in-scope inputs. Validating program input is challenging, as current techniques focus on continuous inputs such as image data and fail with discrete inputs like code data, which have unique characteristics and are processed differently by deep learning models. Adapting out-of-scope programs is also challenging due to their vast search spaces. Therefore, in this paper, we propose CodeImprove, which distinguishes out-of-scope from normal inputs and converts such out-of-scope inputs back to in-scope inputs through program transformation. In particular, we propose a validity score metric to identify out-of-scope inputs and leverage genetic algorithms to apply semantic preserving program transformation to convert out-of-scope inputs to in-scope inputs. Our experimental results show CodeImprove can enhance up to 8.78% of accuracy, and 51.28% of relative improvements in three code models on two SE tasks. Additionally, our input validation is promising in detecting out-of-scope inputs (AUC score of 0.924).</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 47th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2025)</p></details> |

However, reasoning about concurrency is difficult, and unexpected races show up as bugs. Data race detection in shared memory systems is well-studied (dynamic data race detection [13], behavioral types [15], dynamic race detection [31]). Similar to how a data race consists of reads and writes not related by happens-before at a shared memory location, a communication race consists of receives and sends not related by happens-before on a shared channel. Communication races are problematic: a receiver expects a specific message from a specific sender, but with a communication race, the receiver can receive a message meant for another receiver, or not receive anything at all. In this work, we describe a verification framework that can prove the absence of communication races for distributed programs that use a subset of the Go programming language, where synchronization is mainly achieved via message passing. We statically reason about how a distributed program executes, using a happens-before order, extended to buffered and unbuffered channels.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version 1.

In order to prove it, upper bounds are established for the relevant largest eigenvalue sums in terms of the optimal values of certain linear programs. The objective function of these linear programs is the dual of the direct sum of the spectra of the summands. The feasible sets are bounded polyhedra determined by positive numbers, called alignment terms, that quantify the overlaps between pairs of largest eigenvalue spaces of the summands. By appealing to geometric considerations, tight upper bounds are established on the alignment terms of tensor products of positive semi-definite operators. As an application, the spin alignment conjecture in quantum information theory is affirmatively resolved to the 2-letter level. Consequently, the coherent information of platypus channels is additive to the 2-letter level.</p></details> | <details><summary>versi...</summary><p>version 2, 36 pages, 2 figures, error in version 1 corrected; version 3, published version</p></details> |

In this work, we lay the theoretical groundwork for a probabilistic belief programming language pBLIMP, which maintains a probability distribution over the possible environment states, called a belief state. pBLIMP has language features to symbolically model the behavior of and interaction with the partially observable environment and to condition the belief state based on explicit observations. In particular, pBLIMP programs can perform state estimation and base their decisions (i.e. the control flow) on the likelihood that certain conditions hold in the current state. Furthermore, pBLIMP features unbounded loops, which sets it apart from many other probabilistic programming languages. For reasoning about pBLIMP programs and the situations they model, we present a weakest-precondition-style calculus (wp) that is capable of reasoning about unbounded loops. Soundness of our wp calculus is proven with respect to an operational semantics. We further demonstrate how our wp calculus reasons about (unbounded) loops with loop invariants.</p></details> | <details><summary>54 pa...</summary><p>54 pages, 6 figures, to be published in QEST + FORMATS 2025</p></details> |

Chemical reaction networks are mathematically well represented as hypergraphs, modeling that facilitates the search for pathways by computational means. We propose to enrich an existing search method for pathways by including thermodynamic principles. In more detail, we give a mixed-integer linear programming (mixed ILP) formulation of the search problem into which we integrate chemical potentials and concentrations for individual molecules, enabling us to constrain the search to return pathways containing only thermodynamically favorable reactions. Moreover, if multiple possible pathways are found, we can rank these by objective functions based on thermodynamics. As an example of use, we apply the framework to a reaction network representing the HCN-formamide chemistry. Alternative pathways to the one currently hypothesized in the literature are queried and enumerated, including some that score better according to our chosen objective function.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for APR, but existing studies mostly rely on smaller, earlier-generation models and Java benchmarks. The repair capabilities of modern, large-scale LLMs across diverse languages and scenarios remain underexplored. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study of four open-source LLMs, CodeLlama, LLaMA, StarCoder, and DeepSeek-Coder, spanning 7B to 33B parameters, diverse architectures, and purposes. We evaluate them across two bug scenarios (enterprise-grades and algorithmic), three languages (Java, C/C++, Python), and four prompting strategies, analyzing over 600K generated patches on six benchmarks. Key findings include: (1) model specialization (e.g., CodeLlama) can outperform larger general-purpose models (e.g., LLaMA); (2) repair performance does not scale linearly with model size; (3) correct patches often appear early in generation; and (4) prompts significantly affect results. These insights offer practical guidance for designing effective and efficient LLM-based APR systems.</p></details> |  |

This set of 600 tasks has resisted automated solutions. This paper presents a structured inductive programming approach with LLMs that successfully solves tasks across all IPARC categories. The controlled nature of IPARC reveals insights into LLM-based code generation, including the importance of prior structuring, LLMs' ability to aid structuring (requiring human refinement), the need to freeze correct code, the efficiency of code reuse, and how LLM-generated code can spark human creativity. These findings suggest valuable mechanisms for human-LLM collaboration in tackling complex program synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Engineering Scientific Assistants using Interactive Structured Induction of Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14488v2)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We are interested in the construction of software that can act as scientific assistants to domain specialists. It is expected that such assistants will be needed to accelerate the identification of ways to address complex problems requiring urgent solutions. In this paper, our focus is not on a specific scientific problem, but on the software-engineering of such 'science accelerators'. Recent developments in 'No Code' techniques would seem to suggest that scientist can simply hypothesise solutions simply by conversing with a large language model (LLM). However, for complex scientific problems, this seems unlikely given the current state of LLM technology. What does appear feasible is that a software engineer can use LLMs to rapidly construct programs for use by a domain-specialist, including the specialist's requirements expressed in natural language. We propose the design of an interactive form of 'structured' inductive programming in which a software-engineer and an LLM collaboratively construct an 'assistant' for a scientific data analysis. The paper describes a simple implementation called iStrucInd that adapts a '2-way Intelligibility' protocol to implement the interaction between the software engineer and the LLM. We test the tool on two different non-trivial scientific data analysis tasks. Specifically, we compare the system constructed by iStrucInd against systems constructed manually and by Low Code/No Code methods along dimensions of: (a) program performance; (b) program quality; and (c) programming effort. The results show iStrucInd allows a software engineer to develop better programs faster suggesting interactive structured induction can play a useful role in the rapid construction of scientific assistants.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we conducted a survey with 51 professional developers worldwide. We found that AI-based programming assistants need to be improved in order for developers to better trust them with generating code that ensures privacy.

To meet this demand, specialized hardware accelerators are being developed. Optimizing these programs for accelerators is challenging for two reasons: program performance is highly sensitive to variations in sparse inputs, and early-stage accelerators rely on expensive simulators. Therefore, ML-based cost models used for optimizing such programs on general-purpose hardware are often ineffective for early-stage accelerators, as they require large datasets for proper training. To this end, we introduce COGNATE, a novel framework that leverages inexpensive data samples from general-purpose hardware (e.g., CPUs) to train cost models, followed by few-shot fine-tuning on emerging hardware. COGNATE exploits the homogeneity of input features across hardware platforms while effectively mitigating heterogeneity, enabling cost model training with just 5% of the data samples needed by accelerator-specific models to achieve comparable performance. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that COGNATE outperforms existing techniques, achieving average speedups of 1.47x (up to 5.46x) for SpMM and 1.39x (up to 4.22x) for SDDMM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning</p></details> |

However, implementation of quantum recursion involves intricate interplay between quantum control flow and recursive procedure calls. In this paper, we aim at resolving this fundamental challenge and develop a series of techniques to efficiently implement quantum recursive programs. Our main contributions include: 1. We propose a notion of quantum register machine, the first quantum architecture (including an instruction set) that provides instruction-level support for quantum control flow and recursive procedure calls at the same time. 2. Based on quantum register machine, we describe the first comprehensive implementation process of quantum recursive programs, including the compilation, the partial evaluation of quantum control flow, and the execution on the quantum register machine. 3. As a bonus, our efficient implementation of quantum recursive programs also offers automatic parallelisation of quantum algorithms. For implementing certain quantum algorithmic subroutine, like the widely used quantum multiplexor, we can even obtain exponential parallel speed-up (over the straightforward implementation) from this automatic parallelisation. This demonstrates that quantum recursive programming can be win-win for both modularity of programs and efficiency of their implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>63 pa...</summary><p>63 pages, 25 figures.

| **[Context-Augmented Code Generation Using Programming Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18251v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Code-LLMs (CLLMs) have significantly improved code generation, but, they frequently face difficulties when dealing with challenging and complex problems. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by retrieving and integrating external knowledge at the inference time. However, retrieval models often fail to find most relevant context, and generation models, with limited context capacity, can hallucinate when given irrelevant data. We present a novel framework that leverages a Programming Knowledge Graph (PKG) to semantically represent and retrieve code. This approach enables fine-grained code retrieval by focusing on the most relevant segments while reducing irrelevant context through a tree-pruning technique. PKG is coupled with a re-ranking mechanism to reduce even more hallucinations by selectively integrating non-RAG solutions. We propose two retrieval approaches-block-wise and function-wise-based on the PKG, optimizing context granularity. Evaluations on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks show our method improves pass@1 accuracy by up to 20%, and outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 34% on MBPP. Our contributions include PKG-based retrieval, tree pruning to enhance retrieval precision, a re-ranking method for robust solution selection and a Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) enhancer module for automatic code augmentation with relevant comments and docstrings.</p></details> | 20 pages, Conference |
| **[Partial identification via conditional linear programs: estimation and policy learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12215v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many important quantities of interest are only partially identified from observable data: the data can limit them to a set of plausible values, but not uniquely determine them. This paper develops a unified framework for covariate-assisted estimation, inference, and decision making in partial identification problems where the parameter of interest satisfies a series of linear constraints, conditional on covariates. In such settings, bounds on the parameter can be written as expectations of solutions to conditional linear programs that optimize a linear function subject to linear constraints, where both the objective function and the constraints may depend on covariates and need to be estimated from data. Examples include estimands involving the joint distributions of potential outcomes, policy learning with inequality-aware value functions, and instrumental variable settings. We propose two de-biased estimators for bounds defined by conditional linear programs. The first directly solves the conditional linear programs with plugin estimates and uses output from standard LP solvers to de-bias the plugin estimate, avoiding the need for computationally demanding vertex enumeration of all possible solutions for symbolic bounds. The second uses entropic regularization to create smooth approximations to the conditional linear programs, trading a small amount of approximation error for improved estimation and computational efficiency. We establish conditions for asymptotic normality of both estimators, show that both estimators are robust to first-order errors in estimating the conditional constraints and objectives, and construct Wald-type confidence intervals for the partially identified parameters. These results also extend to policy learning problems where the value of a decision policy is only partially identified. We apply our methods to a study on the effects of Medicaid enrollment.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Fast, Reliable, and Secure Programming Language for LLM Agents with Code Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12202v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern large language models (LLMs) are often deployed as agents, calling external tools adaptively to solve tasks. Rather than directly calling tools, it can be more effective for LLMs to write code to perform the tool calls, enabling them to automatically generate complex control flow such as conditionals and loops. Such code actions are typically provided as Python code, since LLMs are quite proficient at it; however, Python may not be the ideal language due to limited built-in support for performance, security, and reliability. We propose a novel programming language for code actions, called Quasar, which has several benefits: (1) automated parallelization to improve performance, (2) uncertainty quantification to improve reliability and mitigate hallucinations, and (3) security features enabling the user to validate actions. LLMs can write code in a subset of Python, which is automatically transpiled to Quasar. We evaluate our approach on the ViperGPT visual question answering agent, applied to the GQA dataset, demonstrating that LLMs with Quasar actions instead of Python actions retain strong performance, while reducing execution time when possible by 42%, improving security by reducing user approval interactions when possible by 52%, and improving reliability by applying conformal prediction to achieve a desired target coverage level.</p></details> |  |

It also serves as a critical enabler for LLM-aided end-to-end hardware language design. However, existing current LLMs often struggle with Register Transfer Level (RTL) code generation, resulting in testbenches that exhibit functional errors in Hardware Description Languages (HDL) logic. Motivated by the strong performance of LLMs in Python code generation under inference-time sampling strategies, and their promising capabilities as judge agents, we propose PRO-V a fully program generation multi-agent system for robust RTL verification. Pro-V incorporates an efficient best-of-n iterative sampling strategy to enhance the correctness of generated testbenches. Moreover, it introduces an LLM-as-a-judge aid validation framework featuring an automated prompt generation pipeline. By converting rule-based static analysis from the compiler into natural language through in-context learning, this pipeline enables LLMs to assist the compiler in determining whether verification failures stem from errors in the RTL design or the testbench. PRO-V attains a verification accuracy of 87.17% on golden RTL implementations and 76.28% on RTL mutants. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/stable-lab/Pro-V.</p></details> |  |

We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning. LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in code-centric LLM reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page at https://livecodebenchpro.com/</p></details> |
| **[Instruction and Solution Probabilities as Heuristics for Inductive Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13804v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction subsets (ISs) are heuristics that can shrink the size of the inductive programming (IP) search space by tens of orders of magnitude. Here, we extend the IS approach by introducing instruction and solution probabilities as additional heuristics. Instruction probability reflects the expectation of an instruction occurring in a solution, based on the frequency of instruction occurrence in a large code sample. The solution probability for a partial or complete program is simply the product of all constituent instruction probabilities, including duplicates. We treat the minimum solution probabilities observed in code sample program units of different sizes as solution probability thresholds. These thresholds are used to prune the search space as partial solutions are constructed, thereby eliminating any branches containing unlikely combinations of instructions. The new approach has been evaluated using a large sample of human code. We tested two formulations of instruction probability: one based on instruction occurrence across the entire code sample and another that measured the distribution separately for each IS. Our results show that both variants produce substantial further reductions in the IP search space size of up to tens of orders of magnitude, depending on solution size. In combination with IS, reductions of over 100 orders of magnitude can be achieved. We also carried out cross-validation testing to show that the heuristics should work effectively with unseen code. The approach is described and the results and some ideas for future work are discussed.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Interior Point Differential Dynamic Programming, Redux](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08278v3)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present IPDDP2, a structure-exploiting algorithm for solving discrete-time, finite-horizon optimal control problems (OCPs) with nonlinear constraints. Inequality constraints are handled using a primal-dual interior point formulation and step acceptance for equality constraints follows a line-search filter approach. The iterates of the algorithm are derived under the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) framework. A proof of local quadratic convergence of the IPDDP2 iterates is provided. Our numerical experiments evaluate IPDDP2 on over 500 OCPs derived from five different classes of robotic motion planning problems, three of which are contact-implicit trajectory optimisation problems. IPDDP2 demonstrates improvements in robustness against existing constrained DDP algorithms for contact-implicit planning, while being significantly faster than general-purpose solver IPOPT. We provide a full implementation of IPDDP2 in the Julia programming language.</p></details> |  |
| **[KEENHash: Hashing Programs into Function-Aware Embeddings for Large-Scale Binary Code Similarity Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11612v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary code similarity analysis (BCSA) is a crucial research area in many fields such as cybersecurity. Specifically, function-level diffing tools are the most widely used in BCSA: they perform function matching one by one for evaluating the similarity between binary programs. However, such methods need a high time complexity, making them unscalable in large-scale scenarios (e.g., 1/n-to-n search). Towards effective and efficient program-level BCSA, we propose KEENHash, a novel hashing approach that hashes binaries into program-level representations through large language model (LLM)-generated function embeddings. KEENHash condenses a binary into one compact and fixed-length program embedding using K-Means and Feature Hashing, allowing us to do effective and efficient large-scale program-level BCSA, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that KEENHash is at least 215 times faster than the state-of-the-art function matching tools while maintaining effectiveness. Furthermore, in a large-scale scenario with 5.3 billion similarity evaluations, KEENHash takes only 395.83 seconds while these tools will cost at least 56 days. We also evaluate KEENHash on the program clone search of large-scale BCSA across extensive datasets in 202,305 binaries. Compared with 4 state-of-the-art methods, KEENHash outperforms all of them by at least 23.16%, and displays remarkable superiority over them in the large-scale BCSA security scenario of malware detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Quadratic Programming Approach to Flight Envelope Protection Using Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18951v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safe operation of aerospace systems within their prescribed flight envelope is a fundamental requirement for modern flight control systems. Flight envelope protection prevents violations of aerodynamic, structural, and performance constraints, mitigating risks such as stall, excessive loads, and loss of control. Conventional FEP approaches, such as reference clipping via saturation functions and model-based command filtering, impose constraints at the reference input level but often fail to account for closed-loop system dynamics, potentially leading to constraint violations during transients. This paper introduces a new approach to the flight envelope protection problem by employing a quadratic programming-based safety filter using control barrier functions to dynamically enforce flight envelope constraints while preserving control performance. Unlike traditional reference filtering methods, the control barrier function-based safety filter actively ensures strict forward invariance of the safe flight envelope set, integrating seamlessly with existing control architectures. The proposed framework is implemented in a nonlinear missile flight control system and evaluated in a simulated environment. The results demonstrate its ability to prevent constraint violations while minimizing conservatism, offering a robust alternative to existing flight envelope protection methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 12 figures, submitted to the AIAA Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics as an Engineering Note</p></details> |
| **[AProVE: Modular Termination Analysis of Memory-Manipulating C Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.02382v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Termination analysis of C programs is a challenging task. On the one hand, the analysis needs to be precise enough to draw meaningful conclusions. On the other hand, relevant programs in practice are large and require substantial abstraction. It is this inherent trade-off that is the crux of the problem. In this work, we present AProVE, a tool that uses symbolic execution to analyze termination of memory-manipulating C programs. While traditionally, AProVE's focus was on the preciseness of the analysis, we describe how we adapted our approach towards a modular analysis. Due to this adaption, our approach can now also handle recursive programs. Moreover, we present further performance improvements which we developed to make AProVE scale to large programs.</p></details> |  |

To address these, we introduce PAJAMA (Program-As-a-Judge for Automated Model Assessment), a new alternative that uses LLMs to synthesize executable judging programs instead of directly scoring responses. These synthesized programs can be stored and run locally, costing orders of magnitude less while providing interpretable, and auditable judging logic that can be easily adapted. Program-based judges mitigate biases, improving judgment consistency by 15.83% and reducing biased responses by 23.7% on average compared to a Qwen2.5-14B-based LLM-as-a-judge. When program judgments are distilled into a model, PAJAMA outperforms LLM-as-a-judge on the challenging CHAT-HARD subset of RewardBench, outperforming metrics by 2.19% on Prometheus and 8.67% on the JudgeLM dataset, all at three orders of magnitude lower cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-task Representation Learning for Mixed Integer Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14409v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) are highly flexible and powerful tools for modeling and solving complex real-world combinatorial optimization problems. Recently, machine learning (ML)-guided approaches have demonstrated significant potential in improving MILP-solving efficiency. However, these methods typically rely on separate offline data collection and training processes, which limits their scalability and adaptability. This paper introduces the first multi-task learning framework for ML-guided MILP solving. The proposed framework provides MILP embeddings helpful in guiding MILP solving across solvers (e.g., Gurobi and SCIP) and across tasks (e.g., Branching and Solver configuration). Through extensive experiments on three widely used MILP benchmarks, we demonstrate that our multi-task learning model performs similarly to specialized models within the same distribution. Moreover, it significantly outperforms them in generalization across problem sizes and tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balans: Multi-Armed Bandits-based Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search for Mixed-Integer Programming Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14382v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-integer programming (MIP) is a powerful paradigm for modeling and solving various important combinatorial optimization problems. Recently, learning-based approaches have shown a potential to speed up MIP solving via offline training that then guides important design decisions during the search. However, a significant drawback of these methods is their heavy reliance on offline training, which requires collecting training datasets and computationally costly training epochs yet offering only limited generalization to unseen (larger) instances. In this paper, we propose Balans, an adaptive meta-solver for MIPs with online learning capability that does not require any supervision or apriori training. At its core, Balans is based on adaptive large-neighborhood search, operating on top of an MIP solver by successive applications of destroy and repair neighborhood operators. During the search, the selection among different neighborhood definitions is guided on the fly for the instance at hand via multi-armed bandit algorithms. Our extensive experiments on hard optimization instances show that Balans offers significant performance gains over the default MIP solver, is better than committing to any single best neighborhood, and improves over the state-of-the-art large-neighborhood search for MIPs. Finally, we release Balans as a highly configurable, MIP solver agnostic, open-source software.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Effects of GitHub Copilot on Computing Students' Programming Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Processes in Brownfield Programming Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10051v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When graduates of computing degree programs enter the software industry, they will most likely join teams working on legacy code bases developed by people other than themselves. In these so-called brownfield software development settings, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) coding assistants like GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software development practices, yet the impact of GenAI on student programmers performing brownfield development tasks remains underexplored. This paper investigates how GitHub Copilot influences undergraduate students' programming performance, behaviors, and understanding when completing brownfield programming tasks in which they add new code to an unfamiliar code base. We conducted a controlled experiment in which 10 undergraduate computer science students completed highly similar brownfield development tasks with and without Copilot in a legacy web application. Using a mixed-methods approach combining performance analysis, behavioral analysis, and exit interviews, we found that students completed tasks 35% faster (p < 0.05) and made 50% more solution progress p (< 0.05) when using Copilot. Moreover, our analysis revealed that, when using Copilot, students spent 11% less time manually writing code (p < 0.05), and 12% less time conducting web searches (p < 0.05), providing evidence of a fundamental shift in how they engaged in programming. In exit interviews, students reported concerns about not understanding how or why Copilot suggestions work. This research suggests the need for computing educators to develop new pedagogical approaches that leverage GenAI assistants' benefits while fostering reflection on how and why GenAI suggestions address brownfield programming tasks. Complete study results and analysis are presented at https://ghcopilot-icer.github.io/.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Non-Euclidean dual gradient ascent for entropically regularized linear and semidefinite programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09711v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an optimization framework that exhibits dimension-independent convergence on a broad class of semidefinite programs (SDPs). Our approach first regularizes the primal problem with the von Neumann entropy, then solve the regularized problem using dual gradient ascent with respect to a problem-adapted norm. In particular, we show that the dual gradient norm converges to zero at a rate independent of the ambient dimension and, via rounding arguments, construct primal-feasible solutions in certain special cases. We also derive explicit convergence rates for the objective. In order to achieve optimal computational scaling, we must accommodate the use of stochastic gradients constructed via randomized trace estimators. Throughout we illustrate the generality of our framework via three important special cases -- the Goemans-Williamson SDP relaxation of the Max-Cut problem, the optimal transport linear program, and several SDP relaxations of the permutation synchronization problem. Numerical experiments confirm that our methods achieve dimension-independent convergence in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Rust Unit Test Coverage through Hybrid Program Analysis and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09002v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit testing is essential for ensuring software reliability and correctness. Classic Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) methods and concolic execution-based approaches for generating unit tests often fail to achieve high coverage due to difficulties in handling complex program units, such as branching conditions and external dependencies. Recent work has increasingly utilized large language models (LLMs) to generate test cases, improving the quality of test generation by providing better context and correcting errors in the model's output. However, these methods rely on fixed prompts, resulting in relatively low compilation success rates and coverage. This paper presents PALM, an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance the generation of high-coverage unit tests. PALM performs program analysis to identify branching conditions within functions, which are then combined into path constraints. These constraints and relevant contextual information are used to construct prompts that guide the LLMs in generating unit tests. We implement the approach and evaluate it in 10 open-source Rust crates. Experimental results show that within just two or three hours, PALM can significantly improves test coverage compared to classic methods, with increases in overall project coverage exceeding 50% in some instances and its generated tests achieving an average coverage of 75.77%, comparable to human effort (71.30%), highlighting the potential of LLMs in automated test generation. We submitted 91 PALM-generated unit tests targeting new code. Of these submissions, 80 were accepted, 5 were rejected, and 6 remain pending review. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating program analysis with AI and open new avenues for future research in automated software testing.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Causal Graph Recovery in Neuroimaging through Answer Set Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09286v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning graphical causal structures from time series data presents significant challenges, especially when the measurement frequency does not match the causal timescale of the system. This often leads to a set of equally possible underlying causal graphs due to information loss from sub-sampling (i.e., not observing all possible states of the system throughout time). Our research addresses this challenge by incorporating the effects of sub-sampling in the derivation of causal graphs, resulting in more accurate and intuitive outcomes. We use a constraint optimization approach, specifically answer set programming (ASP), to find the optimal set of answers. ASP not only identifies the most probable underlying graph, but also provides an equivalence class of possible graphs for expert selection. In addition, using ASP allows us to leverage graph theory to further prune the set of possible solutions, yielding a smaller, more accurate answer set significantly faster than traditional approaches. We validate our approach on both simulated data and empirical structural brain connectivity, and demonstrate its superiority over established methods in these experiments. We further show how our method can be used as a meta-approach on top of established methods to obtain, on average, 12% improvement in F1 score. In addition, we achieved state of the art results in terms of precision and recall of reconstructing causal graph from sub-sampled time series data. Finally, our method shows robustness to varying degrees of sub-sampling on realistic simulations, whereas other methods perform worse for higher rates of sub-sampling.</p></details> |  |

A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |
| **[Program Synthesis from Partial Traces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14480v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first technique to synthesize programs that compose side-effecting functions, pure functions, and control flow, from partial traces containing records of only the side-effecting functions. This technique can be applied to synthesize API composing scripts from logs of calls made to those APIs, or a script from traces of system calls made by a workload, for example. All of the provided traces are positive examples, meaning that they describe desired behavior. Our approach does not require negative examples. Instead, it generalizes over the examples and uses cost metrics to prevent over-generalization. Because the problem is too complex for traditional monolithic program synthesis techniques, we propose a new combination of optimizing rewrites and syntax-guided program synthesis. The resulting program is correct by construction, so its output will always be able to reproduce the input traces. We evaluate the quality of the programs synthesized when considering various optimization metrics and the synthesizer's efficiency on real-world benchmarks. The results show that our approach can generate useful real-world programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at PLDI 2025 (46th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation)</p></details> |

The key idea is to decompose synthesis tasks into simpler relational synthesis subtasks. Specifically, our representation decomposes a training input-output example into sets of input and output facts respectively. We then learn relations between the input and output facts. We demonstrate our approach using an off-the-shelf inductive logic programming (ILP) system on four challenging synthesis datasets. Our results show that (i) our representation can outperform a standard one, and (ii) an off-the-shelf ILP system with our representation can outperform domain-specific approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-lingual Transfer in Programming Languages: An Extensive Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16937v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various software engineering tasks, including error detection, clone detection, and code translation, primarily leveraging high-resource programming languages like Python and Java. However, many critical languages, such as COBOL, as well as emerging languages, such as Rust and Swift, remain low-resource due to limited openly available code. This scarcity hampers the training and effectiveness of LLMs for these languages, increasing software maintenance costs and stifling innovation. Addressing this gap, we investigate the potential of transfer learning to enhance LLM performance on low-resource programming languages by leveraging data from high-resource counterparts. Our extensive empirical study evaluates transferability across 10 to 41 programming languages and five key tasks: code generation, clone detection, code repair, solution domain classification, and error detection. Additionally, we develop a performance prediction model to guess the best source languages for a given target and task, and analyze the features that influence transfer performance. We further replicate a representative subset of experiments with a larger model to test the generalizability of our conclusions to contemporary large-scale LLMs. Our findings demonstrate that cross-lingual transfer significantly outperforms zero-shot learning, with effectiveness varying based on both source and target languages. Furthermore, our model reliably predicts successful transfer sources by considering linguistic and dataset-specific features, offering practical guidance for data acquisition and model training. This work contributes to the development of LLM-driven tools for low-resource programming languages and provides insights into the characteristics that facilitate transfer across language pairs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (06/2025) 26 pages, 5 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

The advanced capabilities of LLM-based programming assistants to support software development tasks have led to a rise in the adoption of LLMs in SE. However, little is known about the evidenced-based practices, tools and processes verified by research findings, supported and adopted by AI programming assistants. To this end, our work conducts a preliminary evaluation exploring the beliefs of LLM used to support software development tasks. We investigate 17 evidence-based claims posited by empirical SE research across five LLM-based programming assistants. Our findings show that LLM-based programming assistants have ambiguous beliefs regarding research claims and lack credible evidence to support responses. Based on our results, we provide implications for practitioners adopting LLM-based programming assistants in development contexts and shed light on future research directions to enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs -- aiming to increase awareness and adoption of evidence-based SE research findings in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Outcome Logic: A Unified Approach to the Metatheory of Program Logics with Branching Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04594v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Starting with Hoare Logic over 50 years ago, numerous program logics have been devised to reason about the diverse programs encountered in the real world. This includes reasoning about computational effects, particularly those effects that cause the program execution to branch into multiple paths due to, e.g., nondeterministic or probabilistic choice. The recently introduced Outcome Logic reimagines Hoare Logic with branching at its core, using an algebraic representation of choice to capture programs that branch into many outcomes. In this article, we expand on prior Outcome Logic papers in order to give a more authoritative and comprehensive account of the metatheory. This includes a relatively complete proof system for Outcome Logic with the ability to reason about general purpose looping. We also show that this proof system applies to programs with various types of branching and that it facilitates the reuse of proof fragments across different kinds of specifications.</p></details> |  |

To improve the interpretability and transparency in control systems, models can be defined as white-box symbolic policies described by mathematical expressions. For better performance in partially observable and volatile environments, the symbolic policies are extended with memory represented by continuous-time latent variables, governed by differential equations. Genetic programming is used for optimisation, resulting in interpretable policies consisting of symbolic expressions. Our results show that symbolic policies with memory compare with black-box policies on a variety of control tasks. Furthermore, the benefit of the memory in symbolic policies is demonstrated on experiments where memory-less policies fall short. Overall, we present a method for evolving high-performing symbolic policies that offer interpretability and transparency, which lacks in black-box models.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages including references and appendix, 7 figures, 1 algorithm, 6 tables</p></details> |

The language introduces anaphoric constructs, such as pronoun variables (e.g., "it", "them"), that are statically resolved through referent-tracking analysis combined with a Hindley-Milner-style type system. Each pronoun is guaranteed to be unambiguous and well-typed at compile time. The Linguine compiler pipeline includes lexing, parsing, clause graph construction, desugaring into a typed intermediate representation, type inference, and abstract interpretation. This enables the early detection of semantic errors, such as undefined or type-inconsistent references. A lightweight backend currently generates Python code. This paper formalizes the core language, defines its typing and operational semantics, and proves the soundness of its pronoun resolution mechanism. An initial evaluation shows that Linguine allows the expression of concise and readable programs while supporting static verification. Linguine represents a step toward programming systems that prioritize human linguistic intuition while remaining grounded in formal methods and type-theoretic rigor.</p></details> |  |

A central challenge is to maintain scalability when dealing with fine-grained timing constraints, which can significantly exacerbate ASP's grounding bottleneck. To address this issue, we leverage extensions of ASP with difference constraints, a simplified form of linear constraints, to handle time-related aspects externally. Our approach effectively decouples metric ASP from the granularity of time, resulting in a solution that is unaffected by time precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Collaborative Conversational Agent System Based on LLMs and Answer Set Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06438v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the Large-Language-Model-driven (LLM-driven) Artificial Intelligence (AI) bots became popular, people realized their strong potential in Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD). However, bots relying wholly on LLMs are unreliable in their knowledge, and whether they can finally produce a correct outcome for the task is not guaranteed. The collaboration among these agents also remains a challenge, since the necessary information to convey is unclear, and the information transfer is by prompts: unreliable, and malicious knowledge is easy to inject. With the help of knowledge representation and reasoning tools such as Answer Set Programming (ASP), conversational agents can be built safely and reliably, and communication among the agents made more reliable as well. We propose a Manager-Customer-Service Dual-Agent paradigm, where ASP-driven bots share the same knowledge base and complete their assigned tasks independently. The agents communicate with each other through the knowledge base, ensuring consistency. The knowledge and information conveyed are encapsulated and invisible to the users, ensuring the security of information transmission. To illustrate the dual-agent conversational paradigm, we have constructed AutoManager, a collaboration system for managing the drive-through window of a fast-food restaurant such as Taco Bell in the US. In AutoManager, the customer service bot takes the customer's order while the manager bot manages the menu and food supply. We evaluated our AutoManager system and compared it with the real-world Taco Bell Drive-Thru AI Order Taker, and the results show that our method is more reliable.</p></details> | 9 pages |

To aid debugging, program reduction techniques try to produce a smaller variant of the input program that still triggers the bug. However, existing execution-unaware program reduction techniques struggle with large and complex Wasm programs, because they rely on static information and apply syntactic transformations, while ignoring the valuable information offered by the input program's execution behavior. We present RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce, novel execution-aware program reduction techniques that leverage execution behaviors via record and replay. RR-Reduce identifies a bug-triggering function as the target function, isolates that function from the rest of the program, and generates a reduced program that replays only the interactions between the target function and the rest of the program. Hybrid-Reduce combines a complementary execution-unaware reduction technique with RR-Reduce to further reduce program size. We evaluate RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce on 28 Wasm programs that trigger a diverse set of bugs in three engines. On average, RR-Reduce reduces the programs to 1.20 percent of their original size in 14.5 minutes, which outperforms the state of the art by 33.15 times in terms of reduction time. Hybrid-Reduce reduces the programs to 0.13 percent of their original size in 3.5 hours, which outperforms the state of the art by 3.42 times in terms of reduced program size and 2.26 times in terms of reduction time. We envision RR-Reduce as the go-to tool for rapid, on-demand debugging in minutes, and Hybrid-Reduce for scenarios where developers require the smallest possible programs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MacroSwarm: A Field-based Compositional Framework for Swarm Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10969v4)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Swarm behaviour engineering is an area of research that seeks to investigate methods and techniques for coordinating computation and action within groups of simple agents to achieve complex global goals like pattern formation, collective movement, clustering, and distributed sensing. Despite recent progress in the analysis and engineering of swarms (of drones, robots, vehicles), there is still a need for general design and implementation methods and tools that can be used to define complex swarm behaviour in a principled way. To contribute to this quest, this article proposes a new field-based coordination approach, called MacroSwarm, to design and program swarm behaviour in terms of reusable and fully composable functional blocks embedding collective computation and coordination. Based on the macroprogramming paradigm of aggregate computing, MacroSwarm builds on the idea of expressing each swarm behaviour block as a pure function, mapping sensing fields into actuation goal fields, e.g., including movement vectors. In order to demonstrate the expressiveness, compositionality, and practicality of MacroSwarm as a framework for swarm programming, we perform a variety of simulations covering common patterns of flocking, pattern formation, and collective decision-making. The implications of the inherent self-stabilisation properties of field-based computations in MacroSwarm are discussed, which formally guarantee some resilience properties and guided the design of the library.</p></details> |  |
| **[New Limits on Distributed Quantum Advantage: Dequantizing Linear Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07574v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we give two results that put new limits on distributed quantum advantage in the context of the LOCAL model of distributed computing. First, we show that there is no distributed quantum advantage for any linear program. Put otherwise, if there is a quantum-LOCAL algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ that finds an $\alpha$-approximation of some linear optimization problem $\Pi$ in $T$ communication rounds, we can construct a classical, deterministic LOCAL algorithm $\mathcal{A}'$ that finds an $\alpha$-approximation of $\Pi$ in $T$ rounds. As a corollary, all classical lower bounds for linear programs, including the KMW bound, hold verbatim in quantum-LOCAL. Second, using the above result, we show that there exists a locally checkable labeling problem (LCL) for which quantum-LOCAL is strictly weaker than the classical deterministic SLOCAL model. Our results extend from quantum-LOCAL also to finitely dependent and non-signaling distributions, and one of the corollaries of our work is that the non-signaling model and the SLOCAL model are incomparable in the context of LCL problems: By prior work, there exists an LCL problem for which SLOCAL is strictly weaker than the non-signaling model, and our work provides a separation in the opposite direction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pel, A Programming Language for Orchestrating AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13453v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new frontiers in computing, yet controlling and orchestrating their capabilities beyond simple text generation remains a challenge. Current methods, such as function/tool calling and direct code generation, suffer from limitations in expressiveness, scalability, cost, security, and the ability to enforce fine-grained control. This paper introduces Pel, a novel programming language specifically designed to bridge this gap. Inspired by the strengths of Lisp, Elixir, Gleam, and Haskell, Pel provides a syntactically simple, homoiconic, and semantically rich platform for LLMs to express complex actions, control flow, and inter-agent communication safely and efficiently. Pel's design emphasizes a minimal, easily modifiable grammar suitable for constrained LLM generation, eliminating the need for complex sandboxing by enabling capability control at the syntax level. Key features include a powerful piping mechanism for linear composition, first-class closures enabling easy partial application and functional patterns, built-in support for natural language conditions evaluated by LLMs, and an advanced Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPeL) with Common Lisp-style restarts and LLM-powered helper agents for automated error correction. Furthermore, Pel incorporates automatic parallelization of independent operations via static dependency analysis, crucial for performant agentic systems. We argue that Pel offers a more robust, secure, and expressive paradigm for LLM orchestration, paving the way for more sophisticated and reliable AI agentic frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>1.

| **[Validating Quantum State Preparation Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05616v3)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the key steps in quantum algorithms is to prepare an initial quantum superposition state with different kinds of features. These so-called state preparation algorithms are essential to the behavior of quantum algorithms, and complicated state preparation algorithms are difficult to develop correctly and effectively. This paper presents Pqasm: a high-assurance framework implemented with the Coq proof assistant, allowing us to certify our Pqasm tool to correctly reflect quantum program behaviors. The key in the framework is to reduce the program correctness assurance of a program containing a quantum superposition state to the program correctness assurance for the program state without superposition. The reduction allows the development of an effective testing framework for testing quantum state preparation algorithm implementations on a classical computer - considered to be a hard problem with no clear solution until this point. We utilize the QuickChick property-based testing framework to test state preparation programs. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach over 5 case studies implemented using Pqasm; such cases are not even simulatable in the current quantum simulators.</p></details> | Version 3 |
| **[Object-Spatial Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15812v6)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of programming languages from low-level assembly to high-level abstractions demonstrates a fundamental principle: by constraining how programmers express computation and enriching semantic information at the language level, we can make previously undecidable program properties tractable for optimization. Building on the insight of this undecidability-lessening effect, we introduce Object-Spatial Programming (OSP), a novel programming model that extends Object-Oriented Programming by introducing topologically-aware class constructs called archetypes. OSP fundamentally inverts the traditional relationship between data and computation, enabling computation to move to data through four specialized archetypes: object classes, node classes (discrete data locations), edge classes (first-class relationships), and walker classes (mobile computational entities). By making topological relationships and traversal patterns explicit at the language level, OSP transforms previously opaque program behaviors into observable, optimizable patterns. This semantic enhancement enables runtime systems to make informed decisions about data locality, parallel execution, and distribution strategies based on explicit topology, while providing programmers with intuitive abstractions for modeling complex systems where connection topology is central to the computational model. The paradigm addresses fundamental limitations in traditional programming models when representing agent-based systems, social networks, neural networks, distributed systems, finite state machines, and other spatially-oriented computational problems, demonstrating how thoughtful abstraction design can simultaneously enhance programmer expressiveness and enable sophisticated system-level optimizations across the computing stack.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 45 pages with appendix</p></details> |
| **[Hadamard-$Π$: Equational Quantum Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06835v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing offers advantages over classical computation, yet the precise features that set the two apart remain unclear. In the standard quantum circuit model, adding a 1-qubit basis-changing gate -- commonly chosen to be the Hadamard gate -- to a universal set of classical reversible gates yields computationally universal quantum computation. However, the computational behaviours enabled by this addition are not fully characterised. We give such a characterisation by introducing a small quantum programming language extending the universal classical reversible programming language $\Pi$ with a single primitive corresponding to the Hadamard gate. The language comes equipped with a sound and complete categorical semantics that is specified by a purely equational theory, enabling reasoning about the equivalence of quantum programs in a way that can be automated. Completeness is shown by means of a novel finite presentation, and corresponding synthesis algorithm, for the groups of orthogonal matrices with entries in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]$.</p></details> | 116 pages |
| **[Denotational Semantics for Probabilistic and Concurrent Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02768v2)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a denotational model for probabilistic and concurrent imperative programs, a class of programs with standard control flow via conditionals and while-loops, as well as probabilistic actions and parallel composition. Whereas semantics for concurrent or randomized programs in isolation is well studied, their combination has not been thoroughly explored and presents unique challenges. The crux of the problem is that interactions between control flow, probabilistic actions, and concurrent execution cannot be captured by straightforward generalizations of prior work on pomsets and convex languages, prominent models for those effects, individually. Our model has good domain theoretic properties, important for semantics of unbounded loops. We also prove two adequacy theorems, showing that the model subsumes typical powerdomain semantics for concurrency and convex powerdomain semantics for probabilistic nondeterminism.</p></details> |  |
| **[Denoising Programming Knowledge Tracing with a Code Graph-based Tuning Adaptor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11107v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Programming Knowledge Tracking (PKT) aims to dynamically diagnose learners' mastery levels of programming knowledge based on their coding activities, facilitating more effective and personalized programming education. However, current PKT studies primarily focus on the implicit relationship between code content and knowledge assessment, often overlooking two types of noise signals in long-term programming activities: unwanted signals from unrelated submissions and weak signals from minor modifications. This practical challenge significantly limits model performance and application. To address this issue, we propose Coda, a Code graph-based tuning adaptor designed to enhance existing PKT models by identifying and mitigating the impact of noise. Specifically, Coda first transforms the loose code sequences submitted by each learner into a compact code graph. By leveraging this code graph, unwanted signals can be identified from a semantic similarity perspective. We then apply a cluster-aware GCN to the code graph, which improves the discrimination of weak signals and enables their clustering for identification. Finally, a lightweight yet effective adaptor is incorporated into the PKT task through optimization with two noise feature-based constraints and a navigational regularization term, to correct knowledge states affected by noise. It is worth mentioning that the Coda framework is model-agnostic and can be adapted to most existing PKT solutions. Extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that Coda effectively performs the PKT task in the presence of noisy programming records, outperforming typical baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD August 2025</p></details> |
| **[SDP-CROWN: Efficient Bound Propagation for Neural Network Verification with Tightness of Semidefinite Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06665v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network verifiers based on linear bound propagation scale impressively to massive models but can be surprisingly loose when neuron coupling is crucial. Conversely, semidefinite programming (SDP) verifiers capture inter-neuron coupling naturally, but their cubic complexity restricts them to only small models. In this paper, we propose SDP-CROWN, a novel hybrid verification framework that combines the tightness of SDP relaxations with the scalability of bound-propagation verifiers. At the core of SDP-CROWN is a new linear bound, derived via SDP principles, that explicitly captures $\ell_{2}$-norm-based inter-neuron coupling while adding only one extra parameter per layer. This bound can be integrated seamlessly into any linear bound-propagation pipeline, preserving the inherent scalability of such methods yet significantly improving tightness. In theory, we prove that our inter-neuron bound can be up to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$ tighter than traditional per-neuron bounds. In practice, when incorporated into the state-of-the-art $\alpha$-CROWN verifier, we observe markedly improved verification performance on large models with up to 65 thousand neurons and 2.47 million parameters, achieving tightness that approaches that of costly SDP-based methods.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Q-WSL: Optimizing Goal-Conditioned RL with Weighted Supervised Learning via Dynamic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06648v5)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel class of advanced algorithms, termed Goal-Conditioned Weighted Supervised Learning (GCWSL), has recently emerged to tackle the challenges posed by sparse rewards in goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL). GCWSL consistently delivers strong performance across a diverse set of goal-reaching tasks due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and stability. However, GCWSL methods lack a crucial capability known as trajectory stitching, which is essential for learning optimal policies when faced with unseen skills during testing. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced when the replay buffer is predominantly filled with sub-optimal trajectories. In contrast, traditional TD-based RL methods, such as Q-learning, which utilize Dynamic Programming, do not face this issue but often experience instability due to the inherent difficulties in value function approximation. In this paper, we propose Q-learning Weighted Supervised Learning (Q-WSL), a novel framework designed to overcome the limitations of GCWSL by incorporating the strengths of Dynamic Programming found in Q-learning. Q-WSL leverages Dynamic Programming results to output the optimal action of (state, goal) pairs across different trajectories within the replay buffer. This approach synergizes the strengths of both Q-learning and GCWSL, effectively mitigating their respective weaknesses and enhancing overall performance. Empirical evaluations on challenging goal-reaching tasks demonstrate that Q-WSL surpasses other goal-conditioned approaches in terms of both performance and sample efficiency. Additionally, Q-WSL exhibits notable robustness in environments characterized by binary reward structures and environmental stochasticity.</p></details> |  |
