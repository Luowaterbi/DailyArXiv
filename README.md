| **[Row-Column Twisted Reed-Solomon codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06919v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we present a new class of codes known as row-column twisted Reed-Solomon codes (abbreviated as RCTRS), motivated by the works of \cite{beelen2017twisted} and \cite{liu2025column}. We explicitly provide conditions for such codes to be MDS and also ensure their existence. By determining the dimensions of their Schur squares, we prove that these MDS codes are not equivalent to Reed-Solomon codes, thus presenting a new family of non-RS MDS codes. Additionally, we prove that these MDS codes are also not equivalent to column twisted Reed-Solomon codes described in \cite{liu2025column}, showing the novelty of our construction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rate-Optimal Streaming Codes over Three-Node Relay Networks with Burst Erasures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06912v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates streaming codes over three-node relay networks under burst packet erasures with a delay constraint $T$. In any sliding window of $T+1$ consecutive packets, the source-to-relay and relay-to-destination channels may introduce burst erasures of lengths at most $b_1$ and $b_2$, respectively. Singhvi et al. proposed a construction achieving the optimal code rate when $\max\{b_1,b_2\}\mid (T-b_1-b_2)$. We construct streaming codes with the optimal rate under the condition $T\geq b_1+b_2+\frac{b_1b_2}{|b_1-b_2|}$, thereby enriching the family of rate-optimal streaming codes for three-node relay networks.</p></details> |  |

An Experiment on Programmers' Adoption of AI-Generated JavaScript Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11453v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the factors influencing programmers' adoption of AI-generated JavaScript code recommendations within the context of lightweight, function-level programming tasks. It extends prior research by (1) utilizing objective (as opposed to the typically self-reported) measurements for programmers' adoption of AI-generated code and (2) examining whether AI-generated comments added to code recommendations and development expertise drive AI-generated code adoption. We tested these potential drivers in an online experiment with 173 programmers. Participants were asked to answer some questions to demonstrate their level of development expertise. Then, they were asked to solve a LeetCode problem without AI support. After attempting to solve the problem on their own, they received an AI-generated solution to assist them in refining their solutions. The solutions provided were manipulated to include or exclude AI-generated comments (a between-subjects factor). Programmers' adoption of AI-generated code was gauged by code similarity between AI-generated solutions and participants' submitted solutions, providing a behavioral measurement of code adoption behaviors. Our findings revealed that, within the context of function-level programming tasks, the presence of comments significantly influences programmers' adoption of AI-generated code regardless of the participants' development expertise.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by JSS (The Journal of Systems & Software)</p></details> |
| **[Codes Correcting Transpositions of Consecutive Symbols](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06692v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of correcting transpositions (or swaps) of consecutive symbols in $ q $-ary strings is studied. A family of codes correcting a transposition at an arbitrary location is described and proved to have asymptotically optimal redundancy. Additionally, an improved construction is given over a binary alphabet. Bounds on the cardinality of codes correcting $ t = \textrm{const} $ transpositions are obtained. A lower bound on the achievable asymptotic rate of optimal codes correcting $ t = \tau n $ transpositions is derived. Finally, a construction of codes correcting all possible patterns of transpositions is presented, and the corresponding lower bound on the zero-error capacity of the $ q $-ary transposition channel is stated.</p></details> |  |
| **[On catastrophicity of convolutional codes and their encoders over $\Z_{p^r}$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06670v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the existence of minimal $p$-encoders for convolutional codes over $\mathbb{Z}_{p^r}$, where $p$ is a prime. This addresses a conjecture from \cite{k}, which posits that every such code admits a minimal $p$-encoder, implying that all convolutional codes over $\mathbb{Z}_{p^r}$ are noncatastrophic when input sequences are restricted to coefficients in $\{0, \dots, p-1\}$. Our contributions include the introduction of a new polynomial invariant that characterizes free codes, which enables us to establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a free code over $\mathbb{Z}_{p^r}$ to be noncatastrophic in the usual sense (where input coefficients are from $\mathbb{Z}_{p^r}$). Based on these findings, we affirm the conjecture by providing a constructive method for obtaining a minimal $p$-encoder for any convolutional code over $\mathbb{Z}_{p^r}$.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReST-RL: Achieving Accurate Code Reasoning of LLMs with Optimized Self-Training and Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19576v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With respect to improving the reasoning accuracy of LLMs, the representative reinforcement learning (RL) method GRPO faces failure due to insignificant reward variance, while verification methods based on process reward models (PRMs) suffer from difficulties with training data acquisition and verification effectiveness. To tackle these problems, this paper introduces ReST-RL, a unified LLM RL paradigm that significantly improves LLM's code reasoning ability by combining an improved GRPO algorithm with a meticulously designed test time decoding method assisted by a value model (VM). As the first stage of policy reinforcement, ReST-GRPO adopts an optimized ReST algorithm to filter and assemble high-value training data, increasing the reward variance of GRPO sampling, thus improving the effectiveness and efficiency of training. After the basic reasoning ability of LLM policy has been improved, we further propose a test time decoding optimization method called VM-MCTS. Through Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS), we collect accurate value targets with no annotation required, on which VM training is based. When decoding, the VM is deployed by an adapted MCTS algorithm to provide precise process signals as well as verification scores, assisting the LLM policy to achieve high reasoning accuracy. We conduct extensive experiments on coding problems to verify the validity of the proposed RL paradigm. Upon comparison, our approach significantly outperforms other reinforcement training baselines (e.g., naive GRPO and ReST-DPO), as well as decoding and verification baselines (e.g., PRM-BoN and ORM-MCTS) on well-known coding benchmarks of various levels (e.g., APPS, BigCodeBench, and HumanEval), indicating its power to strengthen the reasoning ability of LLM policies.

| **[Towards No-Code Programming of Cobots: Experiments with Code Synthesis by Large Code Models for Conversational Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11041v4)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While there has been a lot of research recently on robots in household environments, at the present time, most robots in existence can be found on shop floors, and most interactions between humans and robots happen there. ``Collaborative robots'' (cobots) designed to work alongside humans on assembly lines traditionally require expert programming, limiting ability to make changes, or manual guidance, limiting expressivity of the resulting programs. To address these limitations, we explore using Large Language Models (LLMs), and in particular, their abilities of doing in-context learning, for conversational code generation. As a first step, we define RATS, the ``Repetitive Assembly Task'', a 2D building task designed to lay the foundation for simulating industry assembly scenarios. In this task, a `programmer' instructs a cobot, using natural language, on how a certain assembly is to be built; that is, the programmer induces a program, through natural language. We create a dataset that pairs target structures with various example instructions (human-authored, template-based, and model-generated) and example code. With this, we systematically evaluate the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs for synthesising this kind of code, given in-context examples. Evaluating in a simulated environment, we find that LLMs are capable of generating accurate `first order code' (instruction sequences), but have problems producing `higher-order code' (abstractions such as functions, or use of loops).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ITL4HRI workshop at RO-MAN 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[Conversational Code Generation: a Case Study of Designing a Dialogue System for Generating Driving Scenarios for Testing Autonomous Vehicles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.09829v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-physical systems like autonomous vehicles are tested in simulation before deployment, using domain-specific programs for scenario specification. To aid the testing of autonomous vehicles in simulation, we design a natural language interface, using an instruction-following large language model, to assist a non-coding domain expert in synthesising the desired scenarios and vehicle behaviours. We show that using it to convert utterances to the symbolic program is feasible, despite the very small training dataset. Human experiments show that dialogue is critical to successful simulation generation, leading to a 4.5 times higher success rate than a generation without engaging in extended conversation.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of GeCoIn 2025: Generative Code Intelligence Workshop, co-located with ECAI-2025</p></details> |
| **[When Code Crosses Borders: A Security-Centric Evaluation of LLM-based Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06504v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing demand for cross-language codebase migration, evaluating LLMs' security implications in translation tasks has become critical. Existing evaluations primarily focus on syntactic or functional correctness at the function level, neglecting the critical dimension of security. To enable security evaluation, we construct STED (Security-centric Translation Evaluation Dataset), the first dataset specifically designed for evaluating the security implications of LLM-based code translation. It comprises 720 security-related code samples across five programming languages and nine high-impact CWE categories, sourced from CVE/NVD and manually verified for translation tasks. Our evaluation framework consists of two independent assessment modules: (1) rigorous evaluation by security researchers, and (2) automated analysis via LLM-as-a-judge. Together they evaluate three critical aspects: functional correctness, vulnerability preservation, and vulnerability introduction rates. Our large-scale evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs across 6,000 translation instances reveals significant security degradation, with 28.6-45% of translations introducing new vulnerabilities--particularly for web-related flaws like input validation, where LLMs show consistent weaknesses. Furthermore, we develop a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based mitigation strategy that reduces translation-induced vulnerabilities by 32.8%, showing the potential of knowledge-enhanced prompting.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Error Correction near the Coding Theoretical Bound](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.21171v4)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in quantum computing has enabled systems with tens of reliable logical qubits, built from thousands of noisy physical qubits. However, many impactful applications demand quantum computations with millions of logical qubits, necessitating highly scalable quantum error correction. In classical information theory, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can approach channel capacity efficiently. Yet, no quantum error-correcting codes with efficient decoding have been shown to approach the hashing bound - a fundamental limit on quantum capacity - despite decades of research. Here, we present quantum LDPC codes that not only approach the hashing bound but also allow decoding with computational cost linear in the number of physical qubits. This breakthrough paves the way for large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computation. Combined with emerging hardware that manages many qubits, our approach brings quantum solutions to important real-world problems significantly closer to reality.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to a journal for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Reed-Solomon Codes Against Insertions and Deletions: Full-Length and Rate-$1/2$ Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11371v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of Reed--Solomon codes (RS codes, for short) in the presence of insertion and deletion errors has attracted growing attention in recent literature. In this work, we further study this intriguing mathematical problem, focusing on two regimes. First, we study the question of how well full-length RS codes perform against insertions and deletions. For 2-dimensional RS codes, we provide a complete characterization of codes that cannot correct even a single insertion or deletion. Furthermore, we prove that for sufficiently large field size~$q$, nearly all full-length $2$-dimensional RS codes can correct up to $(1 - \delta)q$ insertion and deletion errors for any $0 < \delta < 1$. Extending beyond the 2-dimensional case, we show that for any $k \ge 2$, there exists a full-length $k$-dimensional RS code capable of correcting $q / (10k)$ insertion and deletion errors, provided $q$ is large enough. Second, we focus on rate $1/2$ RS codes that can correct a single insertion or deletion error. We present a polynomial-time algorithm that constructs such codes over fields of size $q = \Theta(k^4)$. This result matches the existential bound given in \cite{con2023reed}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Revealing the impact of synthetic native samples and multi-tasking strategies in Hindi-English code-mixed humour and sarcasm detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.12761v2)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we reported our experiments with various strategies to improve code-mixed humour and sarcasm detection. Particularly, we tried three approaches: (i) native sample mixing, (ii) multi-task learning (MTL), and (iii) prompting and instruction finetuning very large multilingual language models (VMLMs). In native sample mixing, we added monolingual task samples to code-mixed training sets. In MTL learning, we relied on native and code-mixed samples of a semantically related task (hate detection in our case). Finally, in our third approach, we evaluated the efficacy of VMLMs via few-shot context prompting and instruction finetuning. Some interesting findings we got are (i) adding native samples improved humor (raising the F1-score up to 6.76%) and sarcasm (raising the F1-score up to 8.64%) detection, (ii) training MLMs in an MTL framework boosted performance for both humour (raising the F1-score up to 10.67%) and sarcasm (increment up to 12.35% in F1-score) detection, and (iii) prompting and instruction finetuning VMLMs couldn't outperform the other approaches. Finally, our ablation studies and error analysis discovered the cases where our model is yet to improve. We provided our code for reproducibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages; EMNLP 2025 (Findings)</p></details> |
| **[Single-Shot Decoding of Biased-Tailored Quantum LDPC Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06316v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum processors are often affected by biased noise and noisy readout, which reduce reliability and reproducibility. This work combines two complementary strategies to address these challenges. The first is bias tailoring, which aligns stabilizers with the dominant error type. The second is single-shot (SS) decoding, which uses metachecks to identify measurement faults from just one noisy round. We implement these ideas in a four-dimensional lifted hypergraph product (4D-LHP) code constructed from quasi-cyclic protograph seeds. Simulation results show that bias tailoring lowers the word-error rate (WER) by 20-60 percent across realistic Z:X bias ratios (from 1:1 up to 1000:1), with the largest improvements at moderate bias. When measurement noise is present, a single SS round recovers more than one third of the performance lost to readout errors. Moreover, metachecks identify over 99.8 percent of faulty syndromes, providing near-complete fault visibility even with limited correction power. Together, these findings demonstrate that 4D-LHP codes maintain strong resilience under realistic noise, making them promising candidates for integration into orchestrated QPU-CPU workflows.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Graded Quantum Codes: From Weighted Algebraic Geometry to Homological Chain Complexes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07542v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce graded quantum codes, unifying two classes of quantum error-correcting codes. The first, quantum weighted algebraic geometry (AG) codes, derives from rational points on hypersurfaces in weighted projective spaces over finite fields. This extends classical AG codes by adding weighted degrees and singularities, enabling self-orthogonal codes via the CSS method with improved distances using algebraic structures and invariants like weighted heights.The second class arises from chain complexes of graded vector spaces, generalizing homological quantum codes to include torsion and multiple gradings. This produces low-density parity-check codes with parameters based on homology ranks, including examples from knot invariants and quantum rotors. A shared grading leads to a refined Singleton bound: $d \leq \frac{n - k + 2}{2} - \frac{\epsilon}{2}$, where $\epsilon > 0$ reflects entropy adjustments from geometric singularities and defects. The bound holds partially for simple orbifolds and is supported by examples over small fields. Applications include post-quantum cryptography, fault-tolerant quantum computing, and optimization via graded neural networks, linking algebraic geometry, homological algebra, and quantum information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proof2Silicon: Prompt Repair for Verified Code and Hardware Generation via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06239v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in automated code generation but frequently produce code that fails formal verification, an essential requirement for hardware and safety-critical domains. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we previously proposed PREFACE, a model-agnostic framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that iteratively repairs the prompts provided to frozen LLMs, systematically steering them toward generating formally verifiable Dafny code without costly fine-tuning. This work presents Proof2Silicon, a novel end-to-end synthesis framework that embeds the previously proposed PREFACE flow to enable the generation of correctness-by-construction hardware directly from natural language specifications. Proof2Silicon operates by: (1) leveraging PREFACE's verifier-driven RL agent to optimize prompt generation iteratively, ensuring Dafny code correctness; (2) automatically translating verified Dafny programs into synthesizable high-level C using Dafny's Python backend and PyLog; and (3) employing Vivado HLS to produce RTL implementations. Evaluated rigorously on a challenging 100-task benchmark, PREFACE's RL-guided prompt optimization consistently improved Dafny verification success rates across diverse LLMs by up to 21%. Crucially, Proof2Silicon achieved an end-to-end hardware synthesis success rate of up to 72%, generating RTL designs through Vivado HLS synthesis flows. These results demonstrate a robust, scalable, and automated pipeline for LLM-driven, formally verified hardware synthesis, bridging natural-language specification and silicon realization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empirical Study of Code Large Language Models for Binary Security Patch Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06052v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Security patch detection (SPD) is crucial for maintaining software security, as unpatched vulnerabilities can lead to severe security risks. In recent years, numerous learning-based SPD approaches have demonstrated promising results on source code. However, these approaches typically cannot be applied to closed-source applications and proprietary systems that constitute a significant portion of real-world software, as they release patches only with binary files, and the source code is inaccessible. Given the impressive performance of code large language models (LLMs) in code intelligence and binary analysis tasks such as decompilation and compilation optimization, their potential for detecting binary security patches remains unexplored, exposing a significant research gap between their demonstrated low-level code understanding capabilities and this critical security task. To address this gap, we construct a large-scale binary patch dataset containing \textbf{19,448} samples, with two levels of representation: assembly code and pseudo-code, and systematically evaluate \textbf{19} code LLMs of varying scales to investigate their capability in binary SPD tasks. Our initial exploration demonstrates that directly prompting vanilla code LLMs struggles to accurately identify security patches from binary patches, and even state-of-the-art prompting techniques fail to mitigate the lack of domain knowledge in binary SPD within vanilla models. Drawing on the initial findings, we further investigate the fine-tuning strategy for injecting binary SPD domain knowledge into code LLMs through two levels of representation. Experimental results demonstrate that fine-tuned LLMs achieve outstanding performance, with the best results obtained on the pseudo-code representation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeMixBench: Evaluating Code-Mixing Capabilities of LLMs Across 18 Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.18791v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code-mixing, the practice of switching between languages within a conversation, poses unique challenges for traditional NLP. Existing benchmarks are limited by their narrow language pairs and tasks, failing to adequately assess large language models' (LLMs) code-mixing abilities. Despite the recognized importance of code-mixing for multilingual users, research on LLMs in this context remains sparse. Additionally, current techniques for synthesizing code-mixed data are underdeveloped to generate code-mixing. In response, we introduce CodeMixBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering eight tasks, including three specific to LLMs and five traditional NLP tasks, and 18 languages across seven language families. We also propose a new method for generating large-scale synthetic code-mixed texts by combining word substitution with GPT-4 prompting. Our evaluation reveals consistent underperformance of LLMs on code-mixed datasets involving different language families. Enhancements in training data size, model scale, and few-shot learning could improve their performance. The code and dataset are available at https://github.com/Jeromeyluck/CodeMixBench.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |
| **[TSPC: A Two-Stage Phoneme-Centric Architecture for code-switching Vietnamese-English Speech Recognition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05983v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code-switching (CS) presents a significant challenge for general Auto-Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Existing methods often fail to capture the subtle phonological shifts inherent in CS scenarios. The challenge is particularly difficult for language pairs like Vietnamese and English, where both distinct phonological features and the ambiguity arising from similar sound recognition are present. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for Vietnamese-English CS ASR, a Two-Stage Phoneme-Centric model (TSPC). The TSPC employs a phoneme-centric approach, built upon an extended Vietnamese phoneme set as an intermediate representation to facilitate mixed-lingual modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that TSPC consistently outperforms existing baselines, including PhoWhisper-base, in Vietnamese-English CS ASR, achieving a significantly lower word error rate of 20.8\% with reduced training resources. Furthermore, the phonetic-based two-stage architecture enables phoneme adaptation and language conversion to enhance ASR performance in complex CS Vietnamese-English ASR scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[GRACE: Graph-Guided Repository-Aware Code Completion through Hierarchical Code Fusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05980v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs excel in localized code completion but struggle with repository-level tasks due to limited context windows and complex semantic and structural dependencies across codebases. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates context scarcity by retrieving relevant code snippets, current approaches face significant limitations. They overly rely on textual similarity for retrieval, neglecting structural relationships such as call chains and inheritance hierarchies, and lose critical structural information by naively concatenating retrieved snippets into text sequences for LLM input. To address these shortcomings, GRACE constructs a multi-level, multi-semantic code graph that unifies file structures, abstract syntax trees, function call graphs, class hierarchies, and data flow graphs to capture both static and dynamic code semantics. For retrieval, GRACE employs a Hybrid Graph Retriever that integrates graph neural network-based structural similarity with textual retrieval, refined by a graph attention network-based re-ranker to prioritize topologically relevant subgraphs. To enhance context, GRACE introduces a structural fusion mechanism that merges retrieved subgraphs with the local code context and preserves essential dependencies like function calls and inheritance. Extensive experiments on public repository-level benchmarks demonstrate that GRACE significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all metrics. Using DeepSeek-V3 as the backbone LLM, GRACE surpasses the strongest graph-based RAG baselines by 8.19% EM and 7.51% ES points on every dataset. The code is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/grace_icse-C3D5.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeepStream: Prototyping Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Real-Time Multimedia Transmissions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05971v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) has emerged as a promising technique in 6G for enhancing the efficiency and reliability of data transmission across diverse modalities, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) environments. This advantage is realized by leveraging powerful neural networks to learn an optimal end-to-end mapping from the source data directly to the transmit symbol sequence, eliminating the need for separate source coding, channel coding, and modulation. Although numerous efforts have been made towards efficient DeepJSCC, they have largely stayed at numerical simulations that can be far from practice, leaving the real-world viability of DeepJSCC largely unverified. To this end, we prototype DeepStream upon orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) technology to offer efficient and robust DeepJSCC for multimedia transmission. In conforming to OFDM, we develop both a feature-to-symbol mapping method and a cross-subcarrier precoding method to improve the subcarrier independence and reduce peak-to-average power ratio. To reduce system complexity and enable flexibility in accommodating varying quality of service requirements, we further propose a progressive coding strategy that adjusts the compression ratio based on latency with minimal performance loss. We implement DeepStream for real-time image transmission and video streaming using software-defined radio. Extensive evaluations verify that DeepStream outperforms both the standard scheme and the direct deployment scheme. Particularly, at an SNR of 10 dB, DeepStream achieves a PSNR of 35 dB for image transmission and an MS-SSIM of 20 dB for video streaming, whereas the standard scheme fails to recover meaningful information.</p></details> | 13 pages, 43 figures |
| **[Flexible Coded Distributed Convolution Computing for Enhanced Straggler Resilience and Numerical Stability in Distributed CNNs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01579v3)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deploying Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) on resource-constrained devices necessitates efficient management of computational resources, often via distributed environments susceptible to latency from straggler nodes. This paper introduces the Flexible Coded Distributed Convolution Computing (FCDCC) framework to enhance straggler resilience and numerical stability in distributed CNNs. We extend Coded Distributed Computing (CDC) with Circulant and Rotation Matrix Embedding (CRME) which was originally proposed for matrix multiplication to high-dimensional tensor convolution. For the proposed scheme, referred to as the Numerically Stable Coded Tensor Convolution (NSCTC) scheme, we also propose two new coded partitioning schemes: Adaptive-Padding Coded Partitioning (APCP) for the input tensor and Kernel-Channel Coded Partitioning (KCCP) for the filter tensor. These strategies enable linear decomposition of tensor convolutions and encoding them into CDC subtasks, combining model parallelism with coded redundancy for robust and efficient execution. Theoretical analysis identifies an optimal trade-off between communication and storage costs. Empirical results validate the framework's effectiveness in computational efficiency, straggler resilience, and scalability across various CNN architectures.</p></details> | 15 pages, 7 figures |

This fragmentation stifles innovation and creates substantial development overhead. While the Model Context Protocol (MCP) has emerged as a standard to resolve this, its adoption is hindered by the manual effort required to convert the vast universe of existing software into MCP-compliant services. This is especially true for the millions of open-source repositories on GitHub, the world's largest collection of functional code. This paper introduces Code2MCP, a highly automated, agentic framework designed to transform any GitHub repository into a functional MCP service with minimal human intervention. Our system employs a multi-stage workflow that automates the entire process, from code analysis and environment configuration to service generation and deployment. A key innovation of our framework is an LLM-driven, closed-loop "Run--Review--Fix" cycle, which enables the system to autonomously debug and repair the code it generates. Code2MCP produces not only deployable services but also comprehensive technical documentation, acting as a catalyst to accelerate the MCP ecosystem by systematically unlocking the world's largest open-source code repository and automating the critical last mile of tool integration. The code is open-sourced at https://github.com/DEFENSE-SEU/MCP-Github-Agent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Codes Correcting Two Bursts of Exactly $b$ Deletions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03113v5)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate codes designed to correct two bursts of deletions, where each burst has a length of exactly $b$, where $b>1$. The previous best construction, achieved through the syndrome compression technique, had a redundancy of at most $7\log n+O\left(\log n/\log\log n\right)$ bits. In contrast, our work introduces a novel approach for constructing $q$-ary codes that attain a redundancy of at most $5\log n+O(\log\log n)$ bits for all $b>1$ and $q\ge2$. Additionally, for the case where $b=1$, we present a new construction of $q$-ary two-deletion correcting codes with a redundancy of $5\log n+O(\log\log n)$ bits, for all $q>2$.</p></details> | IEEE TIT, to appear |
| **[GeoAnalystBench: A GeoAI benchmark for assessing large language models for spatial analysis workflow and code generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05881v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have fueled growing interest in automating geospatial analysis and GIS workflows, yet their actual capabilities remain uncertain. In this work, we call for rigorous evaluation of LLMs on well-defined geoprocessing tasks before making claims about full GIS automation. To this end, we present GeoAnalystBench, a benchmark of 50 Python-based tasks derived from real-world geospatial problems and carefully validated by GIS experts. Each task is paired with a minimum deliverable product, and evaluation covers workflow validity, structural alignment, semantic similarity, and code quality (CodeBLEU). Using this benchmark, we assess both proprietary and open source models. Results reveal a clear gap: proprietary models such as ChatGPT-4o-mini achieve high validity 95% and stronger code alignment (CodeBLEU 0.39), while smaller open source models like DeepSeek-R1-7B often generate incomplete or inconsistent workflows (48.5% validity, 0.272 CodeBLEU). Tasks requiring deeper spatial reasoning, such as spatial relationship detection or optimal site selection, remain the most challenging across all models. These findings demonstrate both the promise and limitations of current LLMs in GIS automation and provide a reproducible framework to advance GeoAI research with human-in-the-loop support.</p></details> | 34 pages, 8 figures |

As an application, letting $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \mathbb{F}_2^E$ denote the cut-space of a graph $G=(V, E)$, we show a lower bound of $2^{\lvert E \rvert- (\lvert V \rvert - 1)}$ on the number of $1/2$-thin subgraphs of $G$ and the existence of a $1/2$-thin subgraph with at least $\lvert E \rvert /2-O(\sqrt{\lvert E \rvert \cdot \lvert V \rvert})$ edges. In contrast to previous results on thin subgraphs, our proofs are purely "combinatorial".</p></details> |  |

These scripts are ubiquitous in modern software development pipelines for streamlining testing and delivery. While developing build scripts, practitioners may inadvertently introduce code smells. Code smells are recurring patterns of poor coding practices that may lead to build failures or increase risk and technical debt. The goal of this study is to aid practitioners in avoiding code smells in build scripts through an empirical study of build scripts and issues on GitHub. We employed a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative analysis. We conducted a qualitative analysis of 2000 build-script-related GitHub issues. Next, we developed a static analysis tool, Sniffer, to identify code smells in 5882 build scripts of Maven, Gradle, CMake, and Make files, collected from 4877 open-source GitHub repositories. We identified 13 code smell categories, with a total of 10,895 smell occurrences, where 3184 were in Maven, 1214 in Gradle, 337 in CMake, and 6160 in Makefiles. Our analysis revealed that Insecure URLs were the most prevalent code smell in Maven build scripts, while Hardcoded Paths/URLs were commonly observed in both Gradle and CMake scripts. Wildcard Usage emerged as the most frequent smell in Makefiles. The co-occurrence analysis revealed strong associations between specific smell pairs of Hardcoded Paths/URLs with Duplicates, and Inconsistent Dependency Management with Empty or Incomplete Tags, indicating potential underlying issues in the build script structure and maintenance practices. Based on our findings, we also recommended strategies to mitigate the existence of code smells in build scripts to improve the efficiency, reliability, and maintainability of software projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 tables, 2 figures</p></details> |

However, existing LLM-based frameworks still face significant challenges in accurately handling the complexity of real-world RTL designs, particularly those that are large-scale and involve multi-level module instantiations. To address this issue, we present ComplexVCoder, an open-source LLM-driven framework that enhances both the generation quality and efficiency of complex Verilog code. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage generation mechanism, which leverages an intermediate representation to enable a more accurate and structured transition from natural language descriptions to intricate Verilog designs. In addition, we introduce a rule-based alignment method and a domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to further improve the correctness of the synthesized code by incorporating relevant design knowledge during generation. To evaluate our approach, we construct a comprehensive dataset comprising 55 complex Verilog designs derived from real-world implementations. We also release an open-source benchmark suite for systematically assessing the quality of auto-generated RTL code together with the ComplexVCoder framework. Experimental results show that ComplexVCoder outperforms SOTA frameworks such as CodeV and RTLCoder by 14.6% and 22.2%, respectively, in terms of function correctness on complex Verilog benchmarks. Furthermore, ComplexVcoder achieves comparable generation performances in terms of functionality correctness using a lightweight 32B model (Qwen2.5), rivaling larger-scale models such as GPT-3.5 and DeepSeek-V3.</p></details> | <details><summary>Withd...</summary><p>Withdrawn due to an error in the experimental setup that affected the results.

However, LLMs are prone to hallucination, outputs that stray from intended meanings. Detecting hallucinations in code summarisation is especially difficult due to the complex interplay between programming and natural languages. We introduce a first-of-its-kind dataset, CodeSumEval, with ~10K samples, curated specifically for hallucination detection in code summarisation. We further propose a novel Entity Tracing Framework (ETF) that a) utilises static program analysis to identify code entities from the program and b) uses LLMs to map and verify these entities and their intents within generated code summaries. Our experimental analysis demonstrates the framework's effectiveness, leading to a 73% F1 score. The proposed approach provides a method for detecting hallucinations by tracing entities from the summary to the code, allowing us to evaluate summary accuracy and localise the error within the summary.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in ACL 2025 Main, 14 pages, 3 Figures, 5 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Aligning Requirement for Large Language Model's Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01313v2)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation refers to the automatic generation of source code based on a given programming specification, which has garnered significant attention particularly with the advancement of large language models (LLMs). However, due to the inherent complexity of real-world problems, the LLM-generated code often fails to fully align with the provided specification. While state-of-the-art agent-based techniques have been proposed to enhance LLM code generation, they overlook the critical issue of specification perception, resulting in persistent misalignment issues. Given that accurate perception of programming specifications serves as the foundation of the LLM-based code generation paradigm, ensuring specification alignment is particularly crucial. In this work, we draw on software requirements engineering to propose Specine, a novel specification alignment technique for LLM code generation. Its key idea is to identify misaligned input specifications, lift LLM-perceived specifications, and align them to enhance the code generation performance of LLMs. Our comprehensive experiments on four state-of-the-art LLMs across five challenging competitive benchmarks by comparing with ten state-of-the-art baselines, demonstrate the effectiveness of Specine. For example, Specine outperforms the most effective baseline, achieving an average improvement of 29.60% across all subjects in terms of Pass@1.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2026</p></details> |

More precisely, we show that (i) For every $\delta \in (0,1)$ and $\epsilon > 0$, there is an explicit family of good Tanner LDPC codes of (design) distance $\delta$ that is $(\delta - \epsilon, O_\varepsilon(1))$ list decodable in time $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}_{\varepsilon}(n)$ with alphabet size $O_\delta(1)$, (ii) For every $R \in (0,1)$ and $\epsilon > 0$, there is an explicit family of AEL codes of rate $R$, distance $1-R -\varepsilon$ that is $(1-R-\epsilon, O_\varepsilon(1))$ list decodable in time $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}_{\varepsilon}(n)$ with alphabet size $\text{exp}(\text{poly}(1/\epsilon))$, and (iii) For every $R \in (0,1)$ and $\epsilon > 0$, there is an explicit family of AEL codes of rate $R$, distance $1-R-\varepsilon$ that is $(1-R-\epsilon, O(1/\epsilon))$ list decodable in time $\widetilde{\mathcal{O}}_{\varepsilon}(n)$ with alphabet size $\text{exp}(\text{exp}(\text{poly}(1/\epsilon)))$ using recent near-optimal list size bounds from [JMST25]. Our results are obtained by phrasing the decoding task as an agreement CSP [RWZ20,DHKNT19] on expander graphs and using the fast approximation algorithm for $q$-ary expanding CSPs from [Jer23], which is based on weak regularity decomposition [JST21,FK96]. Similarly to list decoding $q$-ary Ta-Shma's codes in [Jer23], we show that it suffices to enumerate over assignments that are constant in each part (of the constantly many) of the decomposition in order to recover all codewords in the list.</p></details> |  |

Let $ G $ be a finite group, and let $ S $ be a square-free normal subset of $ G $. The Cayley sum graph of $ G $ with respect to $ S $ is a simple graph with vertex set $ G $ and two vertices $ x $ and $ y $ are adjacent if $ xy\in S .$ A subset $ C $ of $ G $ is called perfect code of $ G $ if there exists a Cayley sum graph of $ G $ that admits $ C $ as a perfect code. In particular, if a subgroup of $ G $ is a perfect code of $ G $, then the subgroup is called a subgroup perfect code of $ G $. In this work, we prove that there does not exist any proper perfect subgroup code of symmetric group $ S_n $. Using this result, we provide a complete characterization of the perfect subgroup code of the alternating group $A_n$.</p></details> | 18 pages |

However, the lack of a practical decoding algorithm remains a barrier to their implementation. In this work, we introduce localized statistics decoding, a reliability-guided inversion decoder that is highly parallelizable and applicable to arbitrary quantum low-density parity-check codes. Our approach employs a parallel matrix factorization strategy, which we call on-the-fly elimination, to identify, validate, and solve local decoding regions on the decoding graph. Through numerical simulations, we show that localized statistics decoding matches the performance of state-of-the-art decoders while reducing the runtime complexity for operation in the sub-threshold regime. Importantly, our decoder is more amenable to implementation on specialized hardware, positioning it as a promising candidate for decoding real-time syndromes from experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted version, title change to agree with published version, 23 pages, 12 figures</p></details> |

| **[Code Review Without Borders: Evaluating Synthetic vs. Real Data for Review Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04810v1)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating the decision of whether a code change requires manual review is vital for maintaining software quality in modern development workflows. However, the emergence of new programming languages and frameworks creates a critical bottleneck: while large volumes of unlabelled code are readily available, there is an insufficient amount of labelled data to train supervised models for review classification. We address this challenge by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) to translate code changes from well-resourced languages into equivalent changes in underrepresented or emerging languages, generating synthetic training data where labelled examples are scarce. We assume that although LLMs have learned the syntax and semantics of new languages from available unlabelled code, they have yet to fully grasp which code changes are considered significant or review-worthy within these emerging ecosystems. To overcome this, we use LLMs to generate synthetic change examples and train supervised classifiers on them. We systematically compare the performance of these classifiers against models trained on real labelled data. Our experiments across multiple GitHub repositories and language pairs demonstrate that LLM-generated synthetic data can effectively bootstrap review recommendation systems, narrowing the performance gap even in low-resource settings. This approach provides a scalable pathway to extend automated code review capabilities to rapidly evolving technology stacks, even in the absence of annotated data.</p></details> | 4 pages, 1 figure |

However, these tasks pose significant challenges due to the limited environmental information available at each step, primarily through visual observations. As a result, current approaches, which typically rely on reactive policies, focus solely on immediate observations and often lead to suboptimal decision-making. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{Foresighted Planning with World Model-Driven Code Execution (FPWC)},a framework that prioritizes natural language understanding and structured reasoning to enhance the agent's global understanding of the environment by developing a task-oriented, refinable \emph{world model} at the outset of the task. Foresighted actions are subsequently generated through iterative planning within this world model, executed in the form of executable code. Extensive experiments conducted in simulated environments and on real mobile devices demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches, particularly achieving a 44.4\% relative improvement in task success rate compared to the state-of-the-art in the simulated environment.

Our complex is a natural generalization of the constructions by Panteleev and Kalachev and by Dinur et. al of a square complex (case t=2), which have been applied to the design of classical locally testable codes (LTC) and quantum low-density parity check codes (qLDPC) respectively. We turn the geometric (cubical) complex into a chain complex by relying on constant-sized local codes $h_1,\ldots,h_t$ as gadgets. A recent result of Panteleev and Kalachev on existence of tuples of codes that are product expanding enables us to prove lower bounds on the cycle and co-cycle expansion of our chain complex. For t=4 our construction gives a new family of "almost-good" quantum LTCs -- with constant relative rate, inverse-polylogarithmic relative distance and soundness, and constant-size parity checks. Both the distance of the quantum code and its local testability are proven directly from the cycle and co-cycle expansion of our chain complex.</p></details> | <details><summary>Fixed...</summary><p>Fixed error in analysis of rate of code, by shifting the complex</p></details> |

This uniform token allocation mismatches the intrinsic structure of speech, where information is distributed unevenly over time. To address this, we propose VARSTok, a VAriable-frame-Rate Speech Tokenizer that adapts token allocation based on local feature similarity. VARSTok introduces two key innovations: (1) a temporal-aware density peak clustering algorithm that adaptively segments speech into variable-length units, and (2) a novel implicit duration coding scheme that embeds both content and temporal span into a single token index, eliminating the need for auxiliary duration predictors. Extensive experiments show that VARSTok significantly outperforms strong fixed-rate baselines. Notably, it achieves superior reconstruction naturalness while using up to 23% fewer tokens than a 40 Hz fixed-frame-rate baseline. VARSTok further yields lower word error rates and improved naturalness in zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that a fully dynamic, variable-frame-rate acoustic speech tokenizer can be seamlessly integrated into downstream speech language models.

Recently, repository-level code completion has drawn more attention in modern software development, and several baseline methods and benchmarks have been proposed. However, existing repository-level code completion methods often fall short of fully using the extensive context of a project repository, such as the intricacies of relevant files and class hierarchies. Besides, the existing benchmarks usually focus on limited code completion scenarios, which cannot reflect the repository-level code completion abilities well of existing methods. To address these limitations, we propose the R2C2-Coder to enhance and benchmark the real-world repository-level code completion abilities of code Large Language Models, where the R2C2-Coder includes a code prompt construction method R2C2-Enhance and a well-designed benchmark R2C2-Bench. Specifically, first, in R2C2-Enhance, we first construct the candidate retrieval pool and then assemble the completion prompt by retrieving from the retrieval pool for each completion cursor position. Second, based on R2C2 -Enhance, we can construct a more challenging and diverse R2C2-Bench with training, validation and test splits, where a context perturbation strategy is proposed to simulate the real-world repository-level code completion well. Extensive results on multiple benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of our R2C2-Coder.</p></details> |  |

These codes attain lengths close to the theoretical maximum and are provably inequivalent to Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. Unlike many previous constructions that rely on the point at infinity, our approach allows for more general choices: we consider divisors supported on affine points and divisors consisting of multiple distinct points. This broader framework enables the construction of codes with length approximately $(q + 1 + \lfloor 2\sqrt{q} \rfloor)/2$, further illustrating the tightness of known upper bounds on elliptic MDS code lengths. A detailed comparison shows that our codes are not covered by earlier results. Moreover, we show that their inequivalence to RS codes by explicitly computing the rank of the Schur product of their generator matrices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Knowledge Improve Security? A Coding-Enhanced Jamming Approach for Semantic Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16960v4)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As semantic communication (SemCom) attracts growing attention as a novel communication paradigm, ensuring the security of transmitted semantic information over open wireless channels has become a critical issue. However, traditional encryption methods often introduce significant additional communication overhead to maintain stability, and conventional learning-based secure SemCom methods typically rely on a channel capacity advantage for the legitimate receiver, which is challenging to guarantee in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a coding-enhanced jamming method that eliminates the need to transmit a secret key by utilizing shared knowledge-potentially part of the training set of the SemCom system-between the legitimate receiver and the transmitter. Specifically, we leverage the shared private knowledge base to generate a set of private digital codebooks in advance using neural network (NN)-based encoders. For each transmission, we encode the transmitted data into digital sequence Y1 and associate Y1 with a sequence randomly picked from the private codebook, denoted as Y2, through superposition coding. Here, Y1 serves as the outer code and Y2 as the inner code. By optimizing the power allocation between the inner and outer codes, the legitimate receiver can reconstruct the transmitted data using successive decoding with the index of Y2 shared, while the eavesdropper' s decoding performance is severely degraded, potentially to the point of random guessing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable security to state-of-the-art approaches while significantly improving the reconstruction performance of the legitimate receiver by more than 1 dB across varying channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and compression ratios.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Superposition Code-Based Semantic Communication Approach with Quantifiable and Controllable Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13980v4)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of achieving security in semantic communication (SemCom) over a wiretap channel, where a legitimate receiver coexists with an eavesdropper experiencing a poorer channel condition. Despite previous efforts to secure SemCom against eavesdroppers, guarantee of approximately zero information leakage remains an open issue. In this work, we propose a secure SemCom approach based on superposition code, aiming to provide quantifiable and controllable security for digital SemCom systems. The proposed method employs a double-layered constellation map, where semantic information is associated with satellite constellation points and cloud center constellation points are randomly selected. By carefully allocating power between these two layers of constellation, we ensure that the symbol error probability (SEP) of the eavesdropper when decoding satellite constellation points is nearly equivalent to random guessing, while maintaining a low SEP for the legitimate receiver to successfully decode the semantic information. Simulation results demonstrate that the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean squared error (MSE) of the eavesdropper's reconstructed data, under the proposed method, can range from decoding Gaussian-distributed random noise to approaching the variance of the data. This validates the effectiveness of our method in nearly achieving the experimental upper bound of security for digital SemCom systems when both eavesdroppers and legitimate users utilize identical decoding schemes. Furthermore, the proposed method consistently outperforms benchmark techniques, showcasing superior data security and robustness against eavesdropping. The implementation code is publicly available at: https://github.com/1weixuanchen/ A-Superposition-Code-Based-Semantic-Communication.</p></details> |  |

Recent research has begun to pay attention to the quality structures in NVCs, optimizing them by introducing explicit hierarchical designs. However, less attention has been paid to the reference structure design, which fundamentally should be aligned with the hierarchical quality structure. In addition, there is still significant room for further optimization of the hierarchical quality structure. To address these challenges in NVCs, we propose EHVC, an efficient hierarchical neural video codec featuring three key innovations: (1) a hierarchical multi-reference scheme that draws on traditional video codec design to align reference and quality structures, thereby addressing the reference-quality mismatch; (2) a lookahead strategy to utilize an encoder-side context from future frames to enhance the quality structure; (3) a layer-wise quality scale with random quality training strategy to stabilize quality structures during inference. With these improvements, EHVC achieves significantly superior performance to the state-of-the-art NVCs.

However, its design depends on hand-crafted formulas (e.g., Webster) and manual re-timing by engineers to adapt to demand changes, which is labor-intensive and often yields suboptimal results under heterogeneous or congested conditions. This paper introduces the EvolveSignal, a large language models (LLMs) powered coding agent to automatically discover new traffic signal control algorithms. We formulate the problem as program synthesis, where candidate algorithms are represented as Python functions with fixed input-output structures, and iteratively optimized through external evaluations (e.g., a traffic simulator) and evolutionary search. Experiments on a signalized intersection demonstrate that the discovered algorithms outperform Webster's baseline, reducing average delay by 20.1% and average stops by 47.1%. Beyond performance, ablation and incremental analyses reveal that EvolveSignal modifications-such as adjusting cycle length bounds, incorporating right-turn demand, and rescaling green allocations-can offer practically meaningful insights for traffic engineers. This work opens a new research direction by leveraging AI for algorithm design in traffic signal control, bridging program synthesis with transportation engineering.</p></details> |  |

To achieve this, we define two related binary codes: the associated and the decomposition codes. By considering the Schur product between codewords, we can determine the linearity of the respective $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-linear code. As a result, we establish a connection between the linearity of the $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-linear codes with the linearity of the decomposition code for $\mathbb{Z}_4$ and $\mathbb{Z}_8$-additive codes. Furthermore, we construct $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-additive codes from nested binary codes, resulting in linear $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-linear codes. This construction involves multiple layers of binary codes, where a code in one layer is the square of the code in the previous layer. We also present a sufficient condition that allows checking nonlinearity of the $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-linear codes by simple binary operations in their respective associated codes. Finally, we employ our arguments to verify the linearity of well-known $\mathbb{Z}_{2^L}$-linear code constructions, including the Hadamard, simplex, and MacDonald codes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Designs, Codes and Cryptography</p></details> |

Recently, deep learning-based end-to-end video coding has achieved great success, yet most focus on single-view or stereo videos, leaving general multiview scenarios underexplored. This paper proposes an end-to-end learned multiview video coding (LMVC) framework that ensures random access and backward compatibility while enhancing compression efficiency. Our key innovation lies in effectively leveraging independent-view motion and content information to enhance dependent-view compression. Specifically, to exploit the inter-view motion correlation, we propose a feature-based inter-view motion vector prediction method that conditions dependent-view motion encoding on decoded independent-view motion features, along with an inter-view motion entropy model that learns inter-view motion priors. To exploit the inter-view content correlation, we propose a disparity-free inter-view context prediction module that predicts inter-view contexts from decoded independent-view content features, combined with an inter-view contextual entropy model that captures inter-view context priors. Experimental results show that our proposed LMVC framework outperforms the reference software of the traditional MV-HEVC standard by a large margin, establishing a strong baseline for future research in this field.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long-Horizon Visual Imitation Learning via Plan and Code Reflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05368v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from long-horizon demonstrations with complex action sequences presents significant challenges for visual imitation learning, particularly in understanding temporal relationships of actions and spatial relationships between objects. In this paper, we propose a new agent framework that incorporates two dedicated reflection modules to enhance both plan and code generation. The plan generation module produces an initial action sequence, which is then verified by the plan reflection module to ensure temporal coherence and spatial alignment with the demonstration video. The code generation module translates the plan into executable code, while the code reflection module verifies and refines the generated code to ensure correctness and consistency with the generated plan. These two reflection modules jointly enable the agent to detect and correct errors in both the plan generation and code generation, improving performance in tasks with intricate temporal and spatial dependencies. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce LongVILBench, a benchmark comprising 300 human demonstrations with action sequences of up to 18 steps. LongVILBench emphasizes temporal and spatial complexity across multiple task types. Experimental results demonstrate that existing methods perform poorly on this benchmark, whereas our new framework establishes a strong baseline for long-horizon visual imitation learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Analyzing Variations in Dependency Distributions Due to Code Smell Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03896v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The existence of dependencies between modules, such as classes, can mean that changing a module triggers ripple effects that make maintenance complex and costly, so the advice is to minimize dependencies between modules. It is therefore important to understand the circumstances that can lead to increased dependencies. Recent studies suggest that code smells, which are characteristics of code that indicate potential design issues, may interact in ways that increase dependencies between modules. In this study, we aim to confirm previous observations and investigate whether and how the distribution of static dependencies changes in the presence of code smell interactions. We conducted a dependency analysis on 116 open-source Java systems to quantify the interactions, comparing interactions among code smells and interactions between code smells and non-code smells. Our results suggest that while interactions between code smell pairs are associated with increases in certain dependencies and decreases in others, overall, they are associated with an increase in total dependencies. For example, the median number of dependencies between Feature Envy methods and Data Classes is seven times as many as when the methods are non-Feature Envy methods, increasing from 1 to 7. This implies that developers should prioritize addressing code smells that interact with each other, rather than code smells that exist only in isolation.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Developers' Self-Declaration of AI-Generated Code: An Analysis of Practices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16485v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI code generation tools have gained significant popularity among developers, who use them to assist in software development due to their capability to generate code. Existing studies mainly explored the quality, e.g., correctness and security, of AI-generated code, while in real-world software development, the prerequisite is to distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code, which emphasizes the need to explicitly declare AI-generated code by developers. To this end, this study intends to understand the ways developers use to self-declare AI-generated code and explore the reasons why developers choose to self-declare or not. We conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of two phases. In the first phase, we mined GitHub repositories and collected 613 instances of AI-generated code snippets. In the second phase, we conducted a follow-up practitioners' survey, which received 111 valid responses. Our research revealed the practices followed by developers to self-declare AI-generated code. Most practitioners (76.6%) always or sometimes self-declare AI-generated code. In contrast, other practitioners (23.4%) noted that they never self-declare AI-generated code. The reasons for self-declaring AI-generated code include the need to track and monitor the code for future review and debugging, and ethical considerations. The reasons for not self-declaring AI-generated code include extensive modifications to AI-generated code and the developers' perception that self-declaration is an unnecessary activity. We finally provided guidelines for practitioners to self-declare AI-generated code, addressing ethical and code quality concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 15 images, 8 tables, Manuscript revision submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[New Bounds for Linear Codes with Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03337v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bounds on linear codes play a central role in coding theory, as they capture the fundamental trade-off between error-correction capability (minimum distance) and information rate (dimension relative to length). Classical results characterize this trade-off solely in terms of the parameters $n$, $k$, $d$ and $q$. In this work we derive new bounds under the additional assumption that the code contains a nonzero codeword of weight $w$.By combining residual-code techniques with classical results such as the Singleton and Griesmer bounds,we obtain explicit inequalities linking $n$, $k$, $d$, $q$ and $w$. These bounds impose sharper restrictions on admissible codeword weights, particularly those close to the minimum distance or to the code length. Applications include refined constraints on the weights of MDS codes, numerical restrictions on general linear codes, and excluded weight ranges in the weight distribution. Numerical comparisons across standard parameter sets demonstrate that these $w$-aware bounds strictly enlarge known excluded weight ranges and sharpen structural limitations on linear codes.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Successive Cancellation Decoding For General Monotone Chain Polar Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03128v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Monotone chain polar codes generalize classical polar codes to multivariate settings, offering a flexible approach for achieving the entire admissible rate region in the distributed lossless coding problem. However, this flexibility also introduces significant challenges for existing successive cancellation (SC) based decoding schemes. Motivated by the need for a general SC decoding solution, we present a comprehensive decoding strategy for monotone chain polar codes that can handle arbitrary numbers of terminals, non-binary alphabets, and decoding along arbitrary monotone chains. Specifically, we formulate the SC decoding task as a series of inference subtasks over the polar transform and propose a computational graph framework based on probability propagation principles. This approach highlights the impact of variable switching during decoding and shows that time complexity varies between $O(N\log{N})$ and $O(N^2)$, depending on the specific chain structure. Moreover, we demonstrate that the widely used $O(N)$ space optimization is not universally applicable to monotone chain polar codes, which prompts us to introduce a constant-time decoder forking strategy based on the proposed logical computation graphs. This strategy enables time-efficient list decoding without relying on $O(N)$-space techniques. Numerical results verify the superior performance of the proposed scheme compared with the classical lazy-copy scheme.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we study a class of TECCs with one twist. The parity-check matrices of the TECCs are explicitly given by computing the Weil differentials. Then the sufficient and necessary conditions of self-duality are presented. The minimum distances of the TECCs are also determined. Moreover, examples of MDS, AMDS, self-dual and MDS self-dual TECCs are given. Finally, we calculate the dimensions of the Schur squares of TECCs and show the non-equivalence between TECCs and ECCs/GRS codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Region-of-Interest-Guided Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Image Transmission](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01269v2)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep joint source-channel coding (deepJSCC) methods have shown promising improvements in communication performance over wireless networks. However, existing approaches primarily focus on enhancing overall image reconstruction quality, which may not fully align with user experiences, often driven by the quality of regions of interest (ROI). Motivated by this, we propose ROI-guided joint source-channel coding (ROI-JSCC), a novel deepJSCC framework that prioritizes high-quality transmission of ROI. The ROI-JSCC consists of four key components: (1) Image ROI embedding, (2) ROI-guided split processing, (3) ROI-based loss function design, and (4) ROI-adaptive bandwidth allocation. Together, these components allow ROI-JSCC to selectively enhance the ROI reconstruction quality at varying ROI positions while maintaining overall image quality with minimal computational overhead. Experimental results under diverse communication environments demonstrate that ROI-JSCC significantly improves ROI reconstruction quality while maintaining competitive average image quality compared to recent state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the class of coding optimality of human languages and the origins of Zipf's law](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20015v5)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Here we present a new class of optimality for coding systems. Members of that class are displaced linearly from optimal coding and thus exhibit Zipf's law, namely a power-law distribution of frequency ranks. Within that class, Zipf's law, the size-rank law and the size-probability law form a group-like structure. We identify human languages that are members of the class. All languages showing sufficient agreement with Zipf's law are potential members of the class. In contrast, there are communication systems in other species that cannot be members of that class for exhibiting an exponential distribution instead but dolphins and humpback whales might. We provide a new insight into plots of frequency versus rank in double logarithmic scale. For any system, a straight line in that scale indicates that the lengths of optimal codes under non-singular coding and under uniquely decodable encoding are displaced by a linear function whose slope is the exponent of Zipf's law. For systems under compression and constrained to be uniquely decodable, such a straight line may indicate that the system is coding close to optimality. We provide support for the hypothesis that Zipf's law originates from compression and define testable conditions for the emergence of Zipf's law in compressing systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>a few...</summary><p>a few typos corrected, in press in Europhysics Letters</p></details> |

This paper considers coded caching in a partially cooperative wireless D2D network, where only a subset of users transmit during delivery, while all users request files. The non-transmitting users are referred to as selfish users. All existing schemes that do not require knowledge of the identity of selfish users before content placement are limited to the high-memory regime, particularly when the number of selfish users is large. We propose a novel coded caching scheme for a partially cooperative D2D network that operates in all feasible memory regimes, regardless of the number of selfish users. We also derive a lower bound on the transmission load of a partially cooperative D2D coded caching scheme. Using this bound, the proposed scheme is shown to be optimal in the high-memory regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages and 4 figures</p></details> |

This study conducts a comparative evaluation of code-mixed fine-tuned models and non-code-mixed multilingual models, along with zero-shot generative large language models (LLMs). Specifically, we evaluate HingBERT, HingMBERT, and HingRoBERTa (trained on code-mixed data), and BERT Base Cased, IndicBERT, RoBERTa and MuRIL (trained on non-code-mixed multilingual data). We also assess the performance of Google Gemini in a zero-shot setting using a modified version of the dataset with NER tags removed. All models are tested on a benchmark Hinglish NER dataset using Precision, Recall, and F1-score. Results show that code-mixed models, particularly HingRoBERTa and HingBERT-based fine-tuned models, outperform others - including closed-source LLMs like Google Gemini - due to domain-specific pretraining. Non-code-mixed models perform reasonably but show limited adaptability. Notably, Google Gemini exhibits competitive zero-shot performance, underlining the generalization strength of modern LLMs. This study provides key insights into the effectiveness of specialized versus generalized models for code-mixed NER tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heterogeneous Directed Hypergraph Neural Network over abstract syntax tree (AST) for Code Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04228v4)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code classification is a difficult issue in program understanding and automatic coding. Due to the elusive syntax and complicated semantics in programs, most existing studies use techniques based on abstract syntax tree (AST) and graph neural networks (GNN) to create code representations for code classification. These techniques utilize the structure and semantic information of the code, but they only take into account pairwise associations and neglect the high-order data correlations that already exist between nodes of the same field or called attribute in the AST, which may result in the loss of code structural information. On the other hand, while a general hypergraph can encode high-order data correlations, it is homogeneous and undirected which will result in a lack of semantic and structural information such as node types, edge types, and directions between child nodes and parent nodes when modeling AST. In this study, we propose a heterogeneous directed hypergraph (HDHG) to represent AST and a heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) to process the graph for code classification. Our method improves code understanding and can represent high-order data correlations beyond paired interactions. We assess our heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) on public datasets of Python and Java programs. Our method outperforms previous AST-based and GNN-based methods, which demonstrates the capability of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 35th International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (SEKE 2023) as a regular paper</p></details> |
| **[A Computational Method for Measuring "Open Codes" in Qualitative Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.12142v3)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Qualitative analysis is critical to understanding human datasets in many social science disciplines. A central method in this process is inductive coding, where researchers identify and interpret codes directly from the datasets themselves. Yet, this exploratory approach poses challenges for meeting methodological expectations (such as ``depth'' and ``variation''), especially as researchers increasingly adopt Generative AI (GAI) for support. Ground-truth-based metrics are insufficient because they contradict the exploratory nature of inductive coding, while manual evaluation can be labor-intensive. This paper presents a theory-informed computational method for measuring inductive coding results from humans and GAI. Our method first merges individual codebooks using an LLM-enriched algorithm. It measures each coder's contribution against the merged result using four novel metrics: Coverage, Overlap, Novelty, and Divergence. Through two experiments on a human-coded online conversation dataset, we 1) reveal the merging algorithm's impact on metrics; 2) validate the metrics' stability and robustness across multiple runs and different LLMs; and 3) showcase the metrics' ability to diagnose coding issues, such as excessive or irrelevant (hallucinated) codes. Our work provides a reliable pathway for ensuring methodological rigor in human-AI qualitative analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReCode: Improving LLM-based Code Repair with Fine-Grained Retrieval-Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02330v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in code-related tasks, such as code generation and automated program repair. Despite their promising performance, most existing approaches for code repair suffer from high training costs or computationally expensive inference. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), with its efficient in-context learning paradigm, offers a more scalable alternative. However, conventional retrieval strategies, which are often based on holistic code-text embeddings, fail to capture the structural intricacies of code, resulting in suboptimal retrieval quality. To address the above limitations, we propose ReCode, a fine-grained retrieval-augmented in-context learning framework designed for accurate and efficient code repair. Specifically, ReCode introduces two key innovations: (1) an algorithm-aware retrieval strategy that narrows the search space using preliminary algorithm type predictions; and (2) a modular dual-encoder architecture that separately processes code and textual inputs, enabling fine-grained semantic matching between input and retrieved contexts. Furthermore, we propose RACodeBench, a new benchmark constructed from real-world user-submitted buggy code, which addresses the limitations of synthetic benchmarks and supports realistic evaluation. Experimental results on RACodeBench and competitive programming datasets demonstrate that ReCode achieves higher repair accuracy with significantly reduced inference cost, highlighting its practical value for real-world code repair scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CIKM 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Neural Speech Codec for Noise Robust Speech Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.04132v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers the joint compression and enhancement problem for speech signal in the presence of noise. Recently, the SoundStream codec, which relies on end-to-end joint training of an encoder-decoder pair and a residual vector quantizer by a combination of adversarial and reconstruction losses,has shown very promising performance, especially in subjective perception quality. In this work, we provide a theoretical result to show that, to simultaneously achieve low distortion and high perception in the presence of noise, there exist an optimal two-stage optimization procedure for the joint compression and enhancement problem. This procedure firstly optimizes an encoder-decoder pair using only distortion loss and then fixes the encoder to optimize a perceptual decoder using perception loss. Based on this result, we construct a two-stage training framework for joint compression and enhancement of noisy speech signal. Unlike existing training methods which are heuristic, the proposed two-stage training method has a theoretical foundation. Finally, experimental results for various noise and bit-rate conditions are provided. The results demonstrate that a codec trained by the proposed framework can outperform SoundStream and other representative codecs in terms of both objective and subjective evaluation metrics.

The proposed 2-D arrays have many applications in modern wireless communications, such as multi-carrier code division multiple access (MC-CDMA), massive multiple input multiple output (mMIMO), etc. The main theoretical problem for sequences and 2-D arrays for application in MC-CDMA lies in the efficient construction of such sequences and arrays, which have low peak-to-mean envelope power ratio (PMEPR) and flexible parameter values. The PMEPR measures the power efficiency of the concerned system and hence has been an important research topic for past several years. The proposed construction produces a better PMEPR upper bound than the existing constructions. We also propose a tighter upper bound for the set size which translates more number of supported users in the communication system. We show that for some special cases, the proposed code set is optimal with respect to that bound. Finally, We derive 2-D Golay complementary array set (GCAS) and Golay complementary set (GCS) from the proposed construction, which has significant application in uniform rectangular array (URA)-based massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) system to achieve omnidirectional transmission. The simulation result shows the performance benefits of the derived arrays. In essence, we show that the flexibility of the parameters of the proposed 2-D ZCACS makes it a good candidate for practical use cases, both in theory and simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[DT-UFC: Universal Large Model Feature Coding via Peaky-to-Balanced Distribution Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16495v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Like image coding in visual data transmission, feature coding is essential for the distributed deployment of large models by significantly reducing transmission and storage burden. However, prior studies have mostly targeted task- or model-specific scenarios, leaving the challenge of universal feature coding across diverse large models largely unexplored. In this paper, we present the first systematic study on universal feature coding for large models. The key challenge lies in the inherently diverse and distributionally incompatible nature of features extracted from different models. For example, features from DINOv2 exhibit highly peaky, concentrated distributions, while those from Stable Diffusion 3 (SD3) are more dispersed and uniform. This distributional heterogeneity severely hampers both compression efficiency and cross-model generalization. To address this, we propose a learned peaky-to-balanced distribution transformation, which reshapes highly skewed feature distributions into a common, balanced target space. This transformation is non-uniform, data-driven, and plug-and-play, enabling effective alignment of heterogeneous distributions without modifying downstream codecs. With this alignment, a universal codec trained on the balanced target distribution can effectively generalize to features from different models and tasks. We validate our approach on three representative large models (LLaMA3, DINOv2, and SD3) across multiple tasks and modalities. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves notable improvements in both compression efficiency and cross-model generalization over task-specific baselines.

| **[Feature Coding in the Era of Large Models: Dataset, Test Conditions, and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04307v4)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large models have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks, yet they incur significant computational costs and privacy concerns during both training and inference. Distributed deployment has emerged as a potential solution, but it necessitates the exchange of intermediate information between model segments, with feature representations serving as crucial information carriers. To optimize information exchange, feature coding is required to reduce transmission and storage overhead. Despite its importance, feature coding for large models remains an under-explored area. In this paper, we draw attention to large model feature coding and make three fundamental contributions. First, we introduce a comprehensive dataset encompassing diverse features generated by three representative types of large models. Second, we establish unified test conditions, enabling standardized evaluation pipelines and fair comparisons across future feature coding studies. Third, we introduce two baseline methods derived from widely used image coding techniques and benchmark their performance on the proposed dataset. These contributions aim to provide a foundation for future research and inspire broader engagement in this field.

Semantic memory is encoded in the neocortex with dense, overlapping representations and acquires structured knowledge. Episodic memory is encoded in the hippocampus with sparse, pattern-separated representations and quickly learns the specifics of individual experiences. Recently, this duality between semantic and episodic memories has been challenged by predictive coding, a biologically plausible neural network model of the neocortex which was shown to have hippocampus-like abilities on auto-associative memory tasks. These results raise the question of the episodic capabilities of the neocortex and their relation to semantic memory. In this paper, we present such a predictive coding model of the neocortex and explore its episodic capabilities. We show that this kind of model can indeed recall the specifics of individual examples but only if it is trained on a small number of examples. The model is overfitted to these exemples and does not generalize well, suggesting that episodic memory can arise from semantic learning. Indeed, a model trained with many more examples loses its recall capabilities. This work suggests that individual examples can be encoded gradually in the neocortex using dense, overlapping representations but only in a limited number, motivating the need for sparse, pattern-separated representations as found in the hippocampus.</p></details> |  |
| **[On an analogue of the doubling method in coding theory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.10201v2)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is well known that there is a deep relationship between codes and lattices. Concepts from coding theory are related to concepts of lattice theory as, for example, weight enumerators to theta series, MacWilliams identity to Jacobi identity, and Gleason's theorem to Hecke's theorem. In this framework, higher-genus (or multiple) weight enumerators are related to Siegel theta series, which opens up the possibility of introducing concepts from the theory of higher-rank modular forms to coding theory. There has been important work in this direction, for example Runge introduced a coding theory analogue of Siegel's $\Phi$-operator and Nebe analogues of Hecke operators. In this paper, we show that the celebrated Doubling Method from the theory of higher-rank modular forms has a coding theory analogue. Given the impact that the Doubling Method has had in the study of higher-rank modular forms, one may expect that its analogue may prove useful to the study of higher-genus weight enumerators. In this paper we use it to solve an analogue of the "basis problem". That is, we express "cuspidal" polynomials which are invariant under a Clifford-Weil type group as an explicit linear combination of higher-genus weight enumerators of self-dual codes of that type.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages; changes: extended abstract and introduction, corrected typos</p></details> |

| **[On the Analysis of Random Linear Streaming Codes in Stochastic Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01894v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random Linear Streaming Codes (RLSCs) can dramatically reduce the queuing delay of block codes in real-time services. In this paper, we aim to explore the fundamental limit of large-field-size RLSCs in stochastic symbol erasure channels (SEC). The Non-systematic RLSCs (NRLSCs) in i.i.d. SEC has been analyzed in [Pinwen Su et al. 2022]. In this work, we first derive the closed-form expression on the exact error probability of NRLSCs in Gilbert-Elliott symbol erasure channels (G-ESEC). Compared to i.i.d SEC, the erasure probability of G-ESEC depends on channel state, thus transitions between the states should be considered. To deal with the stochastic state transitions, we introduce two novel techniques. (i) To account for the impact of switching states on probability terms, we find and leverage the recursive structure of the state transition traces. (ii) To obtain the expected number of error timeslots, we derive the stationary initial distribution of the states, and formulate iterative equation to characterize the expectation terms. Then we analyze the Systematic RLSCs (SRLSCs) in a special SEC, i.e., the packet erasure channel (PEC). In this scenario, SRLSCs could save some source symbols which should have exceeded the decoding delay in NRLSCs, and thus could significantly reduce the error probability. To this point, our contributions are two-folds. (i) Through a case study, we find a counter-intuitive phenomenon that SRLSCs can cause unexpected error events comparing to NRLSCs in some erasure patterns. Then we fully characterize the error event of SRLSCs for any erasure pattern. (ii) For i.i.d. PEC, we derive an analytical expression on exact error probability of SRLSCs when length of memory approaches infinity and coding rate equals to 1/2. Simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of our analysis and compare the performance of NRLSCs, SRLSCs, and existing streaming codes.</p></details> |  |

Current benchmarks frequently focus on fine-grained code units, lack complete project context, and use inadequate evaluation metrics. To address these limitations, we introduce SWRBench , a new benchmark comprising 1000 manually verified Pull Requests (PRs) from GitHub, offering PR-centric review with full project context. SWRBench employs an objective LLM-based evaluation method that aligns strongly with human judgment (~90 agreement) by verifying if issues from a structured ground truth are covered in generated reviews. Our systematic evaluation of mainstream ACR tools and LLMs on SWRBench reveals that current systems underperform, and ACR tools are more adept at detecting functional errors. Subsequently, we propose and validate a simple multi-review aggregation strategy that significantly boosts ACR performance, increasing F1 scores by up to 43.67%. Our contributions include the SWRBench benchmark, its objective evaluation method, a comprehensive study of current ACR capabilities, and an effective enhancement approach, offering valuable insights for advancing ACR research.</p></details> |  |
| **[New Results on Vertices that Belong to Every Minimum Locating-Dominating Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01473v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Locating-dominating codes have been studied widely since their introduction in the 1980s by Slater and Rall. In this paper, we concentrate on vertices that must belong to all minimum locating-dominating codes in a graph. We call them min-forced vertices. We show that the number of min-forced vertices in a connected nontrivial graph of order $n$ is bounded above by $\frac{2}{3}\left(n -\gamma^{LD}(G)\right)$, where $\gamma^{LD}(G)$ denotes the cardinality of a minimum locating-dominating code. This implies that the maximum ratio between the number of min-forced vertices and the order of a connected nontrivial graph is at most $\frac{2}{5}$. Moreover, both of these bounds can be attained. We also determine the number of different minimum locating-dominating codes in all paths. In addition, we show that deciding whether a vertex is min-forced is co-NP-hard.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |
| **[A Log-Linear Analytics Approach to Cost Model Regularization for Inpatient Stays through Diagnostic Code Merging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03843v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cost models in healthcare research must balance interpretability, accuracy, and parameter consistency. However, interpretable models often struggle to achieve both accuracy and consistency. Ordinary least squares (OLS) models for high-dimensional regression can be accurate but fail to produce stable regression coefficients over time when using highly granular ICD-10 diagnostic codes as predictors. This instability arises because many ICD-10 codes are infrequent in healthcare datasets. While regularization methods such as Ridge can address this issue, they risk discarding important predictors. Here, we demonstrate that reducing the granularity of ICD-10 codes is an effective regularization strategy within OLS while preserving the representation of all diagnostic code categories. By truncating ICD-10 codes from seven characters to six or fewer, we reduce the dimensionality of the regression problem while maintaining model interpretability and consistency. Mathematically, the merging of predictors in OLS leads to increased trace of the Hessian matrix, which reduces the variance of coefficient estimation. Our findings explain why broader diagnostic groupings like DRGs and HCC codes are favored over highly granular ICD-10 codes in real-world risk adjustment and cost models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to MLHC 2025</p></details> |
| **[From One-Dimensional Codes to Two-Dimensional Codes: A Universal Framework for the Bounded-Weight Constraint](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01240v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent developments in storage -- especially in the area of resistive random access memory (ReRAM) -- are attempting to scale the storage density by regarding the information data as two-dimensional (2D), instead of one-dimensional (1D). Correspondingly, new types of 2D constraints are introduced into the input information data to improve the system reliability. While 1D constraints have been extensively investigated in the literature, the study for 2D constraints is much less profound. Particularly, given a constraint $\mathcal{F}$ and a design of 1D codes whose codewords satisfy $\mathcal{F}$, the problem of constructing efficient 2D codes, such that every row and every column in every codeword satisfy $\mathcal{F}$, has been a challenge. This work provides an efficient solution to the challenging coding problem above for the binary bounded-weight constrained codes that restrict the maximum number of $1$'s (called {\em weight}). Formally, we propose a universal framework to design 2D codes that guarantee the weight of every row and every column of length $n$ to be at most $f(n)$ for any given function $f(n)$. We show that if there exists a design of capacity-approaching 1D codes, then our method also provides capacity-approaching 2D codes for all $f=\omega(\log n)$.</p></details> | Accepted to ITW-25 |

Unlike traditional autoregressive (AR) models that decode strictly left-to-right, Dream-Coder 7B adaptively determines its decoding strategy based on the coding task: sketch-first generation for complex algorithms, left-to-right generation for straightforward completions, and interleaved reasoning generation for code understanding tasks. We adapt a pretrained AR checkpoint to a discrete diffusion frameworks with a continuous-time weighted cross-entropy objective. Our post-training recipe comprises (i) supervised fine-tuning, where we mitigate padding pathologies via random truncation and a padding penalty to improve sample efficiency and stabilize generation; and (ii) reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards over a curated high-quality prompt set drawn from open-source datasets, using a tailored reinforcement learning recipe for diffusion language models. The resulting Dream-Coder 7B Instruct attains 21.4\% pass@1 on LiveCodeBench (2410--2505) and demonstrates competitive performance on HumanEval, MBPP, BigCodeBench, and CRUXEval. We release Dream-Coder-7B and Dream-Coder-7B-Instruct checkpoints, training recipes, preprocessing pipelines, and inference code to facilitate reproducibility and further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Surface: A Solution-Aware Retrieval Model for Competition-level Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01129v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In competitive programming task, problem statements are often embedded within elaborate narrative backgrounds, requiring deep understanding of the underlying solutions to successfully complete the tasks. Current code generation models primarily focus on token-level semantic modeling, highly susceptible to distractions from irrelevant narrative statements. Inspired by RAG, retrieving reference code with similar solutions may help enhance model performance on difficult problems. However, existing retrieval models also emphasize surface-level semantic similarity, neglecting the deeper solution-level logical similarities that are critical in competitive programming. Therefore, designing ranking models capable of accurately identifying and retrieving problems and corresponding codes remains an urgent research problem in competitive code generation. In this paper, we propose SolveRank, a solution-aware ranking model empowered by synthetic data for competitive programming tasks. Specifically, we leverage the DeepSeek-R1 model to generate logically equivalent but differently phrased new problems, verified by GPT-4o for solution consistency. Then, we train SolveRank with these as positive samples and BM25/random-retrieved problems as negatives. During inference, SolveRank retrieves relevant problems and corresponding code from the corpus to assist a downstream code generator. Experiments on the xCodeEval dataset demonstrate that SolveRank outperforms SOTA ranking methods in precision and recall metrics, and boosts code generation performance for difficult problems.</p></details> |  |

Exploring and Evaluating the Design and Trade-offs of Proactive AI Programming Support](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18658v4)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI programming tools enable powerful code generation, and recent prototypes attempt to reduce user effort with proactive AI agents, but their impact on programming workflows remains unexplored. We introduce and evaluate Codellaborator, a design probe LLM agent that initiates programming assistance based on editor activities and task context. We explored three interface variants to assess trade-offs between increasingly salient AI support: prompt-only, proactive agent, and proactive agent with presence and context (Codellaborator). In a within-subject study (N=18), we find that proactive agents increase efficiency compared to prompt-only paradigm, but also incur workflow disruptions. However, presence indicators and interaction context support alleviated disruptions and improved users' awareness of AI processes. We underscore trade-offs of Codellaborator on user control, ownership, and code understanding, emphasizing the need to adapt proactivity to programming processes. Our research contributes to the design exploration and evaluation of proactive AI systems, presenting design implications on AI-integrated programming workflow.</p></details> |  |

While modern dataflow accelerators incorporate on-chip streaming to mitigate off-chip bandwidth limitations, existing programming models struggle to harness these capabilities effectively. Low-level interfaces provide fine-grained control but impose significant development overhead, whereas high-level tile-based languages abstract away communication details, restricting optimization and forcing compilers to reconstruct the intended dataflow. We present Dato, a Python-embedded, task-based programming model for dataflow accelerators that elevates data communication and sharding to first-class type constructs. Developers write programs as a graph of tasks connected via explicit stream types, with sharded inputs specified using layout types. These tasks are first mapped virtually onto the accelerator's spatial fabric, and the compiler then generates a physical mapping that respects hardware constraints. Experimental results on both AMD Ryzen AI NPU and Alveo FPGA devices demonstrate that Dato achieves high performance while significantly reducing the burden of writing optimized code. On the NPU, Dato attains up to 84% hardware utilization for GEMM and delivers a 2.81x speedup on attention kernels compared to a state-of-the-art commercial framework. On the FPGA, Dato surpasses leading frameworks in performance when generating custom systolic arrays, achieving 98% of the theoretical peak performance.</p></details> |  |

This subarea of program analysis is challenging due to the existence of undecidable problems, and this Survey systematically explores approaches that mitigate this inherent difficulty. These include foundational decidability results, the use of ranking functions, and disjunctive well-founded transition invariants. The Survey also discusses non-termination witnesses, used to prove that a program will not halt. We examine the algorithmic and complexity aspects of these methods, showing how different approaches offer a trade-off between expressive power and computational complexity. The Survey does not discuss how termination analysis is performed on real-world programming languages, nor does it consider more expressive abstract models that include non-linear arithmetic, probabilistic choice, or term rewriting systems.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we explore using Large Language Models (LLMs), and in particular, their abilities of doing in-context learning, for conversational code generation. As a first step, we define RATS, the ``Repetitive Assembly Task'', a 2D building task designed to lay the foundation for simulating industry assembly scenarios. In this task, a `programmer' instructs a cobot, using natural language, on how a certain assembly is to be built; that is, the programmer induces a program, through natural language. We create a dataset that pairs target structures with various example instructions (human-authored, template-based, and model-generated) and example code. With this, we systematically evaluate the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs for synthesising this kind of code, given in-context examples. Evaluating in a simulated environment, we find that LLMs are capable of generating accurate `first order code' (instruction sequences), but have problems producing `higher-order code' (abstractions such as functions, or use of loops).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ITL4HRI workshop at RO-MAN 2025 conference</p></details> |

To address this, we intent to improve the multi-programming-lingual (MultiPL) performance of the base LLMs while retaining the most popular ones using restricted computational resources. We consider MultiPL to be a special case of multiple natural languages and propose a MultiPL extension of LLMs utilizing a hybrid mixture of experts (MoE), called MultiPL-MoE. Specifically, MultiPL-MoE combines two paired MoEs to optimize expert selection at both the token and segment levels. The token-level MoE is a standard upcycling MoE structure with a shared expert and a novel gate weight normalization approach that aids in the final fusion with the segment-level MoE. The segment-level MoE incorporates two innovative designs to better capture the syntactic structure and contextual patterns of programming languages: First, using a sliding window to partition the input token sequence into multiple segments; Then, adopting an expert-choice routing strategy that allows experts to select the top-k segments. The results of the experiment proved the effectiveness of MultiPL-MoE.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Challenges Do Developers Face When Using Verification-Aware Programming Languages?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23696v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software reliability is critical in ensuring that the digital systems we depend on function correctly. In software development, increasing software reliability often involves testing. However, for complex and critical systems, developers can use Design by Contract (DbC) methods to define precise specifications that software components must satisfy. Verification-Aware (VA) programming languages support DbC and formal verification at compile-time or run-time, offering stronger correctness guarantees than traditional testing. However, despite the strong guarantees provided by VA languages, their adoption remains limited. In this study, we investigate the barriers to adopting VA languages by analyzing developer discussions on public forums using topic modeling techniques. We complement this analysis with a developer survey to better understand the practical challenges associated with VA languages. Our findings reveal key obstacles to adoption, including steep learning curves and usability issues. Based on these insights, we identify actionable recommendations to improve the usability and accessibility of VA languages. Our findings suggest that simplifying tool interfaces, providing better educational materials, and improving integration with everyday development environments could improve the usability and adoption of these languages. Our work provides actionable insights for improving the usability of VA languages and making verification tools more accessible.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dynamic Programming Framework for Vehicular Task Offloading with Successive Action Improvement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05907v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, task offloading from vehicles with random velocities is optimized via a novel dynamic programming framework. Particularly, in a vehicular network with multiple vehicles and base stations (BSs), computing tasks of vehicles are offloaded via BSs to an edge server. Due to the random velocities, the exact locations of vehicles versus time, namely trajectories, cannot be determined in advance. Hence, instead of deterministic optimization, the cell association, uplink time, and throughput allocation of multiple vehicles during a period of task offloading are formulated as a finite-horizon Markov decision process. In order to derive a low-complexity solution algorithm, a two-time-scale framework is proposed. The scheduling period is divided into super slots, each super slot is further divided into a number of time slots. At the beginning of each super slot, we first obtain a reference scheduling scheme of cell association, uplink time and throughput allocation via deterministic optimization, yielding an approximation of the optimal value function. Within the super slot, the actual scheduling action of each time slot is determined by making improvement to the approximate value function according to the system state. Due to the successive improvement framework, a non-trivial average cost upper bound could be derived. In the simulation, the random trajectories of vehicles are generated from a high-fidelity traffic simulator. It is shown that the performance gain of the proposed scheduling framework over the baselines is significant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Programming tension in 3D printed networks inspired by spiderwebs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05855v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Each element in tensioned structural networks -- such as tensegrity, architectural fabrics, or medical braces/meshes -- requires a specific tension level to achieve and maintain the desired shape, stability, and compliance. These structures are challenging to manufacture, 3D print, or assemble because flattening the network during fabrication introduces multiplicative inaccuracies in the network's final tension gradients. This study overcomes this challenge by offering a fabrication algorithm for direct 3D printing of such networks with programmed tension gradients, an approach analogous to the spinning of spiderwebs. The algorithm: (i) defines the desired network and prescribes its tension gradients using the force density method; (ii) converts the network into an unstretched counterpart by numerically optimizing vertex locations toward target element lengths and converting straight elements into arcs to resolve any remaining error; and (iii) decomposes the network into printable toolpaths; Optional additional steps are: (iv) flattening curved 2D networks or 3D networks to ensure 3D printing compatibility; and (v) automatically resolving any unwanted crossings introduced by the flattening process. The proposed method is experimentally validated using 2D unit cells of viscoelastic filaments, where accurate tension gradients are achieved with an average element strain error of less than 1.0\%. The method remains effective for networks with element minimum length and maximum stress of 5.8 mm and 7.3 MPa, respectively. The method is used to demonstrate the fabrication of three complex cases: a flat spiderweb, a curved mesh, and a tensegrity system. The programmable tension gradient algorithm can be utilized to produce compact, integrated cable networks, enabling novel applications such as moment-exerting structures in medical braces and splints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Natural Language-Programming Language Software Traceability Link Recovery Needs More than Textual Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05585v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of software traceability link recovery (TLR), textual similarity has long been regarded as the core criterion. However, in tasks involving natural language and programming language (NL-PL) artifacts, relying solely on textual similarity is limited by their semantic gap. To this end, we conducted a large-scale empirical evaluation across various types of TLR tasks, revealing the limitations of textual similarity in NL-PL scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an approach that incorporates multiple domain-specific auxiliary strategies, identified through empirical analysis, into two models: the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) via edge types and the prompt-based Gemini 2.5 Pro via additional input information. We then evaluated our approach using the widely studied requirements-to-code TLR task, a representative case of NL-PL TLR. Experimental results show that both the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models outperformed their original counterparts without strategy integration. Furthermore, compared to the current state-of-the-art method HGNNLink, the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models achieved average F1-score improvements of 3.68% and 8.84%, respectively, across twelve open-source projects, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-strategy integration in enhancing overall model performance for the requirements-code TLR task.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 5 images, 11 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |

Specifically, we develop an approximate maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator using dynamic programming and tools from convex analysis. Our approach does not rely on restrictive noise assumptions and employs a Bellman-like update instead of a Bayesian update. Our proposed estimator is computationally efficient, with only modest overhead compared to a standard Kalman filter. Simulations demonstrate that our estimator achieves lower root mean squared error (RMSE) than the Kalman filter and has comparable performance to state-of-the-art estimators, while requiring significantly less computational power.</p></details> |  |
| **[CFaults: Model-Based Diagnosis for Fault Localization in C Programs with Multiple Test Cases](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09337v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging is one of the most time-consuming and expensive tasks in software development. Several formula-based fault localization (FBFL) methods have been proposed, but they fail to guarantee a set of diagnoses across all failing tests or may produce redundant diagnoses that are not subset-minimal, particularly for programs with multiple faults. This paper introduces a novel fault localization approach for C programs with multiple faults. CFaults leverages Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) with multiple observations and aggregates all failing test cases into a unified MaxSAT formula. Consequently, our method guarantees consistency across observations and simplifies the fault localization procedure. Experimental results on two benchmark sets of C programs, TCAS and C-Pack-IPAs, show that CFaults is faster than other FBFL approaches like BugAssist and SNIPER. Moreover, CFaults only generates subset-minimal diagnoses of faulty statements, whereas the other approaches tend to enumerate redundant diagnoses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FM 2024. 15 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables and 5 listings</p></details> |
| **[AgentArmor: Enforcing Program Analysis on Agent Runtime Trace to Defend Against Prompt Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01249v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a powerful new paradigm for solving various problems by combining natural language reasoning with the execution of external tools. However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present AgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph intermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations (e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system. AgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that reconstructs the agent's runtime traces as graph-based intermediate representations with control and data flow described within; (2) a property registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools \& data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over the intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured programs, AgentArmor enables program analysis for sensitive data flow, trust boundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo benchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can reduce the ASR to 3\%, with the utility drop only 1\%.</p></details> |  |

We study symbolic graphics programming, where the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report (32 pages, 12 figures, project page: https://spherelab.ai/SGP-Gen/)</p></details> |

While many actors may send messages to some actor, only the actor may receive from its mailbox. Although actors eliminate many of the issues stemming from shared memory concurrency, they remain vulnerable to communication errors such as protocol violations and deadlocks. Mailbox types are a novel behavioural type system for mailboxes first introduced for a process calculus by de'Liguoro and Padovani in 2018, which capture the contents of a mailbox as a commutative regular expression. Due to aliasing and nested evaluation contexts, moving from a process calculus to a programming language is challenging. This paper presents Pat, the first programming language design incorporating mailbox types, and describes an algorithmic type system. We make essential use of quasi-linear typing to tame some of the complexity introduced by aliasing. Our algorithmic type system is necessarily co-contextual, achieved through a novel use of backwards bidirectional typing, and we prove it sound and complete with respect to our declarative type system. We extend Pat with sums, products and higher-order functions, and also interfaces that allow finer-grained reasoning about mailbox contents. We implement a prototype type checker, and use it to demonstrate the expressiveness of Pat on a factory automation case study and a series of examples from the Savina actor benchmark suite.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised and extended version of paper accepted to ICFP'23</p></details> |

As quantum computing advances, ensuring the reliability of quantum programs has become increasingly important. This paper introduces NovaQ, a diversity-guided testing framework for quantum programs. NovaQ combines a distribution-based test case generator with a novelty-driven evaluation module. The generator produces diverse quantum state inputs by mutating circuit parameters, while the evaluator quantifies behavioral novelty based on internal circuit state metrics, including magnitude, phase, and entanglement. By selecting inputs that map to infrequently covered regions in the metric space, NovaQ effectively explores under-tested program behaviors. We evaluate NovaQ on quantum programs of varying sizes and complexities. Experimental results show that NovaQ consistently achieves higher test input diversity and detects more bugs than existing baseline approaches.</p></details> | 5 pages |

While several programming models provide portability for diverse GPU systems, they don't make any guarantees about performance portability. In this work, we explore several programming models -- CUDA, HIP, Kokkos, RAJA, OpenMP, OpenACC, and SYCL, to assess the consistency of their performance across NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. We use five proxy applications from different scientific domains, create implementations where missing, and use them to present a comprehensive comparative evaluation of the performance portability of these programming models. We provide a Spack scripting-based methodology to ensure reproducibility of experiments conducted in this work. Finally, we analyze the reasons for why some programming models underperform in certain scenarios and in some cases, present performance optimizations to the proxy applications.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Assessing Large Language Models in Comprehending and Verifying Concurrent Programs across Memory Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14326v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As concurrent programming becomes increasingly prevalent, effectively identifying and addressing concurrency issues such as data races and deadlocks is critical. This study evaluates the performance of several leading large language models (LLMs), including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Mistral-AI's Large2, in understanding and analyzing concurrency issues within software programs. Given that relaxed memory models, such as Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO), are widely implemented and adapted in modern systems, supported even by commodity architectures like ARM and x86, our evaluation focuses not only on sequentially consistent memory models but also on these relaxed memory models. Specifically, we assess two main aspects: the models' capacity to detect concurrency problems under a sequentially consistent memory model and their ability to verify the correctness conditions of concurrent programs across both sequentially consistent and relaxed memory models. To do this, we leverage SV-COMP's pthread tests and 25 ARM Litmus tests designed to evaluate Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO) memory models. The experimental results reveal that GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Mistral-AI's Large2 demonstrate a robust understanding of concurrency issues, effectively identifying data races and deadlocks when assessed under a sequentially consistent memory model. However, despite its superior performance, all selected LLMs face significant challenges verifying program correctness under relaxed memory models. These LLMs exhibit limitations in accurately capturing memory ordering constraints, and their current capabilities fall short in verifying even small programs in these complex scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sensitivity analysis of an epidemic model with a mass vaccination program of a homogeneous population](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04188v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The COVID-19 pandemic forced the rapid development of vaccines and the implementation of mass vaccination programs around the world. However, many hesitated to take the vaccine due to concerns about its effectiveness. By looking at an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of disease spread that incorporates a mass vaccination program, this study aims to determine the sensitivity of the cumulative count of infected individuals ($W$) and the cumulative death count ($D$) to the following model parameters: disease transmission rate ($\beta$), reciprocal of the disease latency period ($\kappa$), reciprocal of the infectious period ($\gamma$), death ratio ($\alpha$), vaccine efficacy rate ($r$), and vaccine rollout rate ($\delta$). This was implemented using Latin hypercube sampling and partial rank correlation coefficient. Results show that $D$ is highly sensitive to $\alpha$ and shows increasing sensitivity to $\delta$ in the long run. On the other hand, $W$ is highly sensitive to $\kappa$ at the beginning of the simulation, but this weakens over time. In contrast, $W$ is not very sensitive to $\delta$ initially but becomes very significant in the long run. This supports the importance of the vaccine rollout rate over the vaccine efficacy rate in curbing the spread of the disease in the population. It is also worthwhile to reduce the death ratio by developing a cure for the disease or improving the healthcare system as a whole.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication to SciEnggJ</p></details> |
| **[Adversarial Bug Reports as a Security Risk in Language Model-Based Automated Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05372v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) - based Automated Program Repair (APR) systems are increasingly integrated into modern software development workflows, offering automated patches in response to natural language bug reports. However, this reliance on untrusted user input introduces a novel and underexplored attack surface. In this paper, we investigate the security risks posed by adversarial bug reports -- realistic-looking issue submissions crafted to mislead APR systems into producing insecure or harmful code changes. We develop a comprehensive threat model and conduct an empirical study to evaluate the vulnerability of state-of-the-art APR systems to such attacks. Our demonstration comprises 51 adversarial bug reports generated across a spectrum of strategies, from manual curation to fully automated pipelines. We test these against leading APR model and assess both pre-repair defenses (e.g., LlamaGuard variants, PromptGuard variants, Granite-Guardian, and custom LLM filters) and post-repair detectors (GitHub Copilot, CodeQL). Our findings show that current defenses are insufficient: 90\% of crafted bug reports triggered attacker-aligned patches. The best pre-repair filter blocked only 47\%, while post-repair analysis-often requiring human oversight-was effective in just 58\% of cases. To support scalable security testing, we introduce a prototype framework for automating the generation of adversarial bug reports. Our analysis exposes a structural asymmetry: generating adversarial inputs is inexpensive, while detecting or mitigating them remains costly and error-prone. We conclude with practical recommendations for improving the robustness of APR systems against adversarial misuse and highlight directions for future work on trustworthy automated repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Specification-Guided Repair of Arithmetic Errors in Dafny Programs using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03659v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging and repairing faults when programs fail to formally verify can be complex and time-consuming. Automated Program Repair (APR) can ease this burden by automatically identifying and fixing faults. However, traditional APR techniques often rely on test suites for validation, but these may not capture all possible scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide strong correctness criteria, enabling more effective automated repair. In this paper, we present an APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare logic to determine the state of each statement within the program, and applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The models considered are GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% fault localization coverage and GPT-4o mini yields the highest repair success rate of 74.18%. These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-based program synthesis for automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[MTP: A Meaning-Typed Language Abstraction for AI-Integrated Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08965v5)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software development is shifting from traditional programming to AI-integrated applications that leverage generative AI and large language models (LLMs) during runtime. However, integrating LLMs remains complex, requiring developers to manually craft prompts and process outputs. Existing tools attempt to assist with prompt engineering, but often introduce additional complexity. This paper presents Meaning-Typed Programming (MTP), a novel paradigm that abstracts LLM integration through intuitive language-level constructs. By leveraging the inherent semantic richness of code, MTP automates prompt generation and response handling without additional developer effort. We introduce the (1) by operator for seamless LLM invocation, (2) MT-IR, a meaning-based intermediate representation for semantic extraction, and (3) MT-Runtime, an automated system for managing LLM interactions. We implement MTP in Jac, a programming language that supersets Python, and find that MTP significantly reduces coding complexity while maintaining accuracy and efficiency. MTP significantly reduces development complexity, lines of code modifications needed, and costs while improving run-time performance and maintaining or exceeding the accuracy of existing approaches. Our user study shows that developers using MTP completed tasks 3.2x faster with 45% fewer lines of code compared to existing frameworks. Moreover, MTP demonstrates resilience even when up to 50% of naming conventions are degraded, demonstrating robustness to suboptimal code. MTP is developed as part of the Jaseci open-source project, and is available under the module byLLM.</p></details> | OOPSLA 2025 |

With the rise of large language models (LLMs) in recent years, research in programming education has increasingly focused on automated feedback generation to help teachers provide timely support to every student. However, prior studies often overlook key pedagogical principles, such as mastery and progress adaptation, that shape effective feedback strategies. This paper introduces a novel pedagogical framework for LLM-driven feedback generation derived from established feedback models and local insights from secondary school teachers. To evaluate this framework, we implemented a web-based application for Python programming with LLM-based feedback that follows the framework and conducted a mixed-method evaluation with eight secondary-school computer science teachers. Our findings suggest that teachers consider that, when aligned with the framework, LLMs can effectively support students and even outperform human teachers in certain scenarios through instant and precise feedback. However, we also found several limitations, such as its inability to adapt feedback to dynamic classroom contexts. Such a limitation highlights the need to complement LLM-generated feedback with human expertise to ensure effective student learning. This work demonstrates an effective way to use LLMs for feedback while adhering to pedagogical standards and highlights important considerations for future systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECTEL...</summary><p>ECTEL 2025 Preprint.

| **[Parse Tree Tracking Through Time for Programming Process Analysis at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03668v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background and Context: Programming process data can be utilized to understand the processes students use to write computer programming assignments. Keystroke- and line-level event logs have been used in the past in various ways, primarily in high-level descriptive statistics (e.g., timings, character deletion rate, etc). Analysis of behavior in context (e.g., how much time students spend working on loops) has been cumbersome because of our inability to automatically track high-level code representations, such as abstract syntax trees, through time and unparseable states. Objective: Our study has two goals. The first is to design the first algorithm that tracks parse tree nodes through time. Second, we utilize this algorithm to perform a partial replication study of prior work that used manual tracking of code representations, as well as other novel analyses of student programming behavior that can now be done at scale. Method: We use two algorithms presented in this paper to track parse tree nodes through time and construct tree representations for unparseable code states. We apply these algorithms to a public keystroke data from student coursework in a 2021 CS1 course and conduct analysis on the resulting parse trees. Findings: We discover newly observable statistics at scale, including that code is deleted at similar rates inside and outside of conditionals and loops, a third of commented out code is eventually restored, and that frequency with which students jump around in their code may not be indicative of struggle. Implications: The ability to track parse trees through time opens the door to understanding new dimensions of student programming, such as best practices of structural development of code over time, quantitative measurement of what syntactic constructs students struggle most with, refactoring behavior, and attention shifting within the code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably data-driven projection method for quadratic programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04524v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Projection methods aim to reduce the dimensionality of the optimization instance, thereby improving the scalability of high-dimensional problems. Recently, Sakaue and Oki proposed a data-driven approach for linear programs (LPs), where the projection matrix is learned from observed problem instances drawn from an application-specific distribution of problems. We analyze the generalization guarantee for the data-driven projection matrix learning for convex quadratic programs (QPs). Unlike in LPs, the optimal solutions of convex QPs are not confined to the vertices of the feasible polyhedron, and this complicates the analysis of the optimal value function. To overcome this challenge, we demonstrate that the solutions of convex QPs can be localized within a feasible region corresponding to a special active set, utilizing Caratheodory's theorem. Building on such observation, we propose the unrolled active set method, which models the computation of the optimal value as a Goldberg-Jerrum (GJ) algorithm with bounded complexities, thereby establishing learning guarantees. We then further extend our analysis to other settings, including learning to match the optimal solution and input-aware setting, where we learn a mapping from QP problem instances to projection matrices.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Semantically Reflected Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03318v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the dichotomy between the formalization of structural and the formalization of behavioral knowledge by means of semantically lifted programs, which explore an intuitive connection between programs and knowledge graphs. While knowledge graphs and ontologies are eminently useful to represent formal knowledge about a system's individuals and universals, programming languages are designed to describe the system's evolution. To address this dichotomy, we introduce a semantic lifting of the program states of an executing program into a knowledge graph, for an object-oriented programming language. The resulting graph is exposed as a semantic reflection layer within the programming language, allowing programmers to leverage knowledge of the application domain in their programs. In this paper, we formalize semantic lifting and semantic reflection for a small programming language, SMOL, explain the operational aspects of the language, and consider type correctness and virtualisation for runtime program queries through the semantic reflection layer. We illustrate semantic lifting and semantic reflection through a case study of geological modelling and discuss different applications of the technique. The language implementation is open source and available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Gaps Between Student and Expert Evaluations of AI-Generated Programming Hints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03269v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI has the potential to enhance education by providing personalized feedback to students at scale. Recent work has proposed techniques to improve AI-generated programming hints and has evaluated their performance based on expert-designed rubrics or student ratings. However, it remains unclear how the rubrics used to design these techniques align with students' perceived helpfulness of hints. In this paper, we systematically study the mismatches in perceived hint quality from students' and experts' perspectives based on the deployment of AI-generated hints in a Python programming course. We analyze scenarios with discrepancies between student and expert evaluations, in particular, where experts rated a hint as high-quality while the student found it unhelpful. We identify key reasons for these discrepancies and classify them into categories, such as hints not accounting for the student's main concern or not considering previous help requests. Finally, we propose and discuss preliminary results on potential methods to bridge these gaps, first by extending the expert-designed quality rubric and then by adapting the hint generation process, e.g., incorporating the student's comments or history. These efforts contribute toward scalable, personalized, and pedagogically sound AI-assisted feedback systems, which are particularly important for high-enrollment educational settings.</p></details> | L@S'25 |

This study investigates the potential of metacognitive theory to inform AI-assisted programming education through a hint system designed around the metacognitive phases of planning, monitoring, and evaluation. Upon request, the system can provide three types of AI-generated hints--planning, debugging, and optimization--to guide students at different stages of problem-solving. Through a study with 102 students in an introductory data science programming course, we find that students perceive and engage with planning hints most highly, whereas optimization hints are rarely requested. We observe a consistent association between requesting planning hints and achieving higher grades across question difficulty and student competency. However, when facing harder tasks, students seek additional debugging but not more planning support. These insights contribute to the growing field of AI-assisted programming education by providing empirical evidence on the importance of pedagogical principles in AI-assisted learning.</p></details> | AIED'25 paper |

Usually, DRPs act as leaders and determine electricity pricing strategies to maximize their economic revenue, while end-users adjust their power consumption following the pricing signals. However, this profit-seeking bi-level optimization model often neglects the satisfaction of end-users participating in DR programs. In addition, the detailed mathematical models underlying user decision-making strategy and satisfaction evaluation mechanism are typically unavailable to DRPs, posing significant challenges to conventional model-based solution methods. To address these issues, this paper designs a user-side satisfaction evaluation mechanism and proposes a multi-branch temporal fusion twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MBTF-TD3) reinforcement learning algorithm. User satisfaction feedback is incorporated into the reward function via a dynamically adjusted penalty term. The proposed MBTF structure effectively extracts temporal feature dependencies in the time-series observation data, and the dynamically adjusted penalty function successfully enhances the overall satisfaction level of users. Several experiments are conducted to validate the performance and the effectiveness of our proposed solution algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version corrects equation display errors that occurred in the IEEE Xplore version.

Fine-tuning LLMs for program repair is a recent avenue of research, with many dimensions which have not been explored. Existing work mostly fine-tune LLMs with naive code representations and does not scale to frontier models. To address this problem, we propose RepairLLaMA, a novel program repair approach that 1) identifies optimal code representations for APR with fine-tuned models, and 2) pioneers state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique (PEFT) for program repair. This results in RepairLLaMA producing a highly effective `program repair adapter' for fixing bugs with AI. Our experiments demonstrate the validity of both concepts. First, fine-tuning adapters with program repair specific code representations enables the model to use meaningful repair signals and produce better patches. Second, parameter-efficient fine-tuning helps fine-tuning to converge and clearly contributes to the effectiveness of RepairLLaMA in fixing bugs outside the fine-tuning data distribution. Overall, RepairLLaMA correctly fixes 144 Defects4J v2, 109 HumanEval-Java, and 20 GitBug-Java bugs, outperforming all baselines.</p></details> | Accepted to IEEE TSE |

We propose a new way of approximating a solution for this problem, which is known to be formulated as an unconstrained MDP with a continuous information-state using Q-factors. To avoid the computational complexity of discretizing the continuous information-state space, we propose a truncated rollout-based backward-forward approximate dynamic programming (ADP) framework. Our approach consists of two phases: an offline base policy approximation over a shorter time horizon, followed by an online rollout lookahead minimization, both supported by provable convergence guarantees. We supplement our theoretical results with a numerical example where we demonstrate the cost improvement of the rollout method compared to a previously proposed policy approximation method, and the computational complexity observed in executing the offline and online phases for the two methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multilinear and Linear Programs for Partially Identifiable Queries in Quasi-Markovian Structural Causal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03548v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate partially identifiable queries in a class of causal models. We focus on acyclic Structural Causal Models that are quasi-Markovian (that is, each endogenous variable is connected with at most one exogenous confounder). We look into scenarios where endogenous variables are observed (and a distribution over them is known), while exogenous variables are not fully specified. This leads to a representation that is in essence a Bayesian network where the distribution of root variables is not uniquely determined. In such circumstances, it may not be possible to precisely compute a probability value of interest. We thus study the computation of tight probability bounds, a problem that has been solved by multilinear programming in general, and by linear programming when a single confounded component is intervened upon. We present a new algorithm to simplify the construction of such programs by exploiting input probabilities over endogenous variables. For scenarios with a single intervention, we apply column generation to compute a probability bound through a sequence of auxiliary linear integer programs, thus showing that a representation with polynomial cardinality for exogenous variables is possible. Experiments show column generation techniques to be superior to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Causal Abstractions and Representations (CAR) workshop of the 41st Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[From Traces to Program Incorrectness: A Type-Theoretic Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02428v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a type-theoretic framework for reasoning about incorrectness in functional programs that interact with effectful, opaque library APIs. Our approach centers on traces -- temporally-ordered sequences of library API invocations -- which naturally characterize both the preconditions of individual APIs and their composite behavior. We represent these traces using symbolic regular expressions (SREs), enabling formal specification of incorrect abstract data type (ADT) behaviors across function boundaries. The core contribution is a novel type inference algorithm that operates modulo specified incorrectness properties and leverages the symbolic finite automata (SFAs) representations of regexes for compositional reasoning of traces. When the algorithm succeeds, the inferred types witness that an ADT implementation can exhibit some subset of the specified incorrect behaviors. This represents the first systematic approach to underapproximate reasoning against trace-based incorrectness specifications, enabling a new form of trace-guided compositional analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Genetic Programming with Model Driven Dimension Repair for Learning Interpretable Appointment Scheduling Rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02034v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Appointment scheduling is a great challenge in healthcare operations management. Appointment rules (AR) provide medical practitioners with a simple yet effective tool to determine patient appointment times. Genetic programming (GP) can be used to evolve ARs. However, directly applying GP to design ARs may lead to rules that are difficult for end-users to interpret and trust. A key reason is that GP is unaware of the dimensional consistency, which ensures that the evolved rules align with users' domain knowledge and intuitive understanding. In this paper, we develop a new dimensionally aware GP algorithm with dimension repair to evolve ARs with dimensional consistency and high performance. A key innovation of our method is the dimension repair procedure, which optimizes the dimensional consistency of an expression tree while minimizing structural changes and ensuring that its output dimension meets the problem's requirements. We formulate the task as a mixed-integer linear programming model that can be efficiently solved using common mathematical programming methods. With the support of the dimension repair procedure, our method can explore a wider range of AR structures by temporarily breaking the dimensional consistency of individuals, and then restoring it without altering their overall structure, thereby identifying individuals with greater potential advantages. We evaluated the proposed method in a comprehensive set of simulated clinics. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach managed to evolve high-quality ARs that significantly outperform not only the manually designed ARs but also existing state-of-the-art dimensionally aware GP methods in terms of both objective values and dimensional consistency. In addition, we analyzed the semantics of the evolved ARs, providing insight into the design of more effective and interpretable ARs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

Given an input, the program may produce different outcomes depending on the underlying stochastic choices in the program. This means testing the expected outcomes of probabilistic programs requires repeated test executions unlike deterministic programs where a single execution may suffice for each test input. This raises the following question: how many times should we run a probabilistic program to effectively test it? This work proposes a novel black-box unit testing method, ProbTest, for testing the outcomes of probabilistic programs. Our method is founded on the theory surrounding a well-known combinatorial problem, the coupon collector's problem. Using this method, developers can write unit tests as usual without extra effort while the number of required test executions is determined automatically with statistical guarantees for the results. We implement ProbTest as a plug-in for PyTest, a well-known unit testing tool for python programs. Using this plug-in, developers can write unit tests similar to any other Python program and the necessary test executions are handled automatically. We evaluate the method on case studies from the Gymnasium reinforcement learning library and a randomized data structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print of paper to appear in the proceedings of the 23nd edition of the International Conference on Software Engineering and Formal Methods (SEFM'25)</p></details> |

We present a framework that integrates spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL), runtime feedback, and Chain-of-Thought-structured prompting into an autonomous repair loop. Unlike prior approaches, our method explicitly combines statistical program analysis with LLM reasoning. The iterative repair cycle leverages a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting approach, where the model reasons over failing tests, suspicious code regions, and prior patch outcomes, before generating new candidate patches. The model iteratively changes the code, evaluates the results, and incorporates reasoning from previous attempts into subsequent modifications, reducing repeated errors and clarifying why some bugs remain unresolved. Our evaluation spans 3,902 bugs from the Codeflaws benchmark, where our approach achieves 44.93% repair accuracy, representing a 3.61% absolute improvement over strong state-of-the-art APR baselines such as GPT-4 with CoT. This outcome highlights a practical pathway toward integrating statistical program analysis with generative AI in automated debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Laws of Quantum Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19463v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the fundamental laws of quantum programming. We extend a comprehensive set of Hoare et al.'s basic laws of classical programming to the quantum setting. These laws characterise the algebraic properties of quantum programs, such as the distributivity of sequential composition over (quantum) if-statements and the unfolding of nested (quantum) if-statements. At the same time, we clarify some subtle differences between certain laws of classical programming and their quantum counterparts. Additionally, we derive a fixpoint characterisation of quantum while-loops and a loop-based realisation of tail recursion in quantum programming. Furthermore, we establish two normal form theorems: one for quantum circuits and one for finite quantum programs. The theory in which these laws are established is formalised in the Coq proof assistant, and all of these laws are mechanically verified. As an application case of our laws, we present a formal derivation of the principle of deferred measurements in dynamic quantum circuits. We expect that these laws can be utilised in correctness-preserving transformation, compilation, and automatic code optimisation in quantum programming. In particular, because these laws are formally verified in Coq, they can be confidently applied in quantum program development.</p></details> |  |

Typically, these predictions are supported by lengthy manual analyses and numerical simulations and are carried out for one specific application at a time. In this paper, we present Traq, a principled approach towards estimating the quantum speedup of classical programs fully automatically and with provable guarantees. It consists of a classical language that includes high-level primitives amenable to quantum speedups, a cost analysis, and a compilation to low-level quantum programs. Our cost analysis upper bounds the complexity of the resulting quantum program in a fine-grained way: it captures non-asymptotic information and is sensitive to the input of the program (rather than providing worst-case costs). We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation and a case study inspired by AND-OR trees.</p></details> | 50 pages |

From languages designed to be intentionally obtuse (e.g. INTERCAL) to others targeting artistic expression (e.g. Piet) or exploring the nature of computation (e.g. Fractan), there is rich variety in the realm of esoteric programming languages. This essay examines the counterintuitive appeal of esoteric languages and seeks to analyse reasons for this popularity. We will explore why people are attracted to esoteric languages in terms of (a) program comprehension and construction, as well as (b) language design and implementation. Our assertion is that esoteric languages can improve general PL awareness, at the same time as enabling the esoteric programmer to impress their peers with obscure knowledge. We will also consider pedagogic principles and the use of AI, in relation to esoteric languages. Emerging from the specific discussion, we identify a general set of 'good' reasons for designing new programming languages. It may not be possible to be exhaustive on this topic, and it is certain we have not achieved that goal here. However we believe our most important contribution is to draw attention to the varied and often implicit motivations involved in programming language design.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

The model describes a minimal set of abstract operations to enable hardware topology discovery, kernel execution, memory management, communication, and instance management, without prescribing any implementation decisions. The goal of the model is to enable execution in current and future systems without the need for significant refactoring, while also being able to serve any governing parallel programming paradigm. In terms of software abstraction, HiCR is naturally located between distributed heterogeneous systems and runtime systems. We coin the phrase \emph{Runtime Support Layer} for this level of abstraction. We explain how the model's components and operations are realized by a plugin-based approach that takes care of device-specific implementation details, and present examples of HiCR-based applications that operate equally on a diversity of platforms.</p></details> |  |

The second scenario is when a player's opponent in a normal form game is not completely rational but shows some degree of malice. We show how one can compute a more profitable defensive play compared to simply playing a maximin strategy. We provide detailed computation procedure and numerical results for both scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Motivated by probabilistic programmers' domain expertise and debugging strategies, we introduce RefineStat, a language model--driven framework that enforces semantic constraints ensuring synthesized programs contain valid distributions and well-formed parameters, and then applies diagnostic-aware refinement by resampling prior or likelihood components whenever reliability checks fail. We evaluate RefineStat on multiple probabilistic-programming code-generation tasks using smaller language models (SLMs) and find that it produces programs that are both syntactically sound and statistically reliable, often matching or surpassing those from closed-source large language models (e.g., OpenAI o3).</p></details> | <details><summary>Refin...</summary><p>RefineStat constrains LM decoding with statistical validity checks and uses diagnostic-guided resampling (priors/likelihoods) to transform small LMs' drafts into correct, reliable probabilistic programs that can match or surpass closed-source models</p></details> |

Low-precision computation has emerged as a key technique to improve efficiency while reducing resource consumption. Existing approaches for generating low-precision kernels are limited to weight bit widths that are powers of two and suffer from suboptimal performance because of high-level GPU programming abstractions. These abstractions restrict critical optimizations, such as fine-grained register management and optimized memory access patterns, that are essential for efficient low-precision computations. In this paper, we introduce Tilus, a domain-specific language designed for General-Purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing that supports low-precision data types with arbitrary bit widths from 1 to 8 while maintaining GPU programmability. Tilus features a thread-block-level programming model, a hierarchical memory space, a novel algebraic layout system, and extensive support for diverse low-precision data types. Tilus programs are compiled into highly efficient GPU programs through automatic vectorization and instruction selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Tilus efficiently supports a full spectrum of low-precision data types, and outperforms state-of-the-art low-precision kernels. Compared to existing compilers such as Triton and Ladder, as well as hand-optimized kernels such as QuantLLM and Marlin, Tilus achieves performance improvements of: $1.75\times$, $2.61\times$, $1.29\times$ and $1.03\times$, respectively.

| **[Abstract Interpretation of Temporal Safety Effects of Higher Order Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02791v3)** | 2025-08-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper describes a new abstract interpretation-based approach to verify temporal safety properties of recursive, higher-order programs. While prior works have provided theoretical impact and some automation, they have had limited scalability. We begin with a new automata-based "abstract effect domain" for summarizing context-sensitive dependent effects, capable of abstracting relations between the program environment and the automaton control state. Our analysis includes a new transformer for abstracting event prefixes to automatically computed context-sensitive effect summaries, and is instantiated in a type-and-effect system grounded in abstract interpretation. Since the analysis is parametric on the automaton, we next instantiate it to a broader class of history/register (or "accumulator") automata, beyond finite state automata to express some context-free properties, input-dependency, event summation, resource usage, cost, equal event magnitude, etc. We implemented a prototype evDrift that computes dependent effect summaries (and validates assertions) for OCaml-like recursive higher-order programs. As a basis of comparison, we describe reductions to assertion checking for higher-order but effect-free programs, and demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior tools Drift, RCaml/Spacer, MoCHi, and ReTHFL. Overall, across a set of 23 benchmarks, Drift verified 12 benchmarks, RCaml/Spacer verified 6, MoCHi verified 11, ReTHFL verified 18, and evDrift verified 21; evDrift also achieved a 6.3x, 5.3x, 16.8x, and 6.4x speedup over Drift, RCaml/Spacer, MoCHi, and ReTHFL, respectively, on those benchmarks that both tools could solve.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Based Program Generation for Triggering Numerical Inconsistencies Across Compilers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00256v1)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Floating-point inconsistencies across compilers can undermine the reliability of numerical software. We present LLM4FP, the first framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate floating-point programs specifically designed to trigger such inconsistencies. LLM4FP combines Grammar-Based Generation and Feedback-Based Mutation to produce diverse and valid programs. We evaluate LLM4FP across multiple compilers and optimization levels, measuring inconsistency rate, time cost, and program diversity. LLM4FP detects over twice as many inconsistencies compared to the state-of-the-art tool, Varity. Notably, most of the inconsistencies involve real-valued differences, rather than extreme values like NaN or infinities. LLM4FP also uncovers inconsistencies across a wider range of optimization levels, and finds the most mismatches between host and device compilers. These results show that LLM-guided program generation improves the detection of numerical inconsistencies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Models and Logic Programs for Trustworthy Financial Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21051v2)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>According to the United States Internal Revenue Service, ''the average American spends $\$270$ and 13 hours filing their taxes''. Even beyond the U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability, making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages. Our results demonstrate the promise and economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic architectures for increasing equitable access to reliable tax assistance.</p></details> |  |

Yet, many data-driven approaches lack causal semantics and thus only consider correlations. We introduce COBRA-PPM, a novel causal Bayesian reasoning architecture that combines causal Bayesian networks and probabilistic programming to perform interventional inference for robot manipulation under uncertainty. We demonstrate its capabilities through high-fidelity Gazebo-based experiments on an exemplar block stacking task, where it predicts manipulation outcomes with high accuracy (Pred Acc: 88.6%) and performs greedy next-best action selection with a 94.2% task success rate. We further demonstrate sim2real transfer on a domestic robot, showing effectiveness in handling real-world uncertainty from sensor noise and stochastic actions. Our generalised and extensible framework supports a wide range of manipulation scenarios and lays a foundation for future work at the intersection of robotics and causality.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, accepted to the 2025 IEEE European Conference on Mobile Robots (ECMR 2025)</p></details> |

To this end, we extend transformation methods based on integer TRSs to handle arbitrary data types, global variables, function calls and arrays, as well as encode safety checks. Then we adapt existing rewriting induction methods to LCTRSs and propose a simple yet effective method to generalize equations. We show that we can automatically verify memory safety and prove correctness of realistic functions. Our approach proves equivalence between two implementations, so in contrast to other works, we do not require an explicit specification in a separate specification language.</p></details> |  |
| **[Endmember Extraction from Hyperspectral Images Using Self-Dictionary Approach with Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.13098v3)** | 2025-08-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral imaging technology has a wide range of applications, including forest management, mineral resource exploration, and Earth surface monitoring. A key step in utilizing this technology is endmember extraction, which aims to identify the spectral signatures of materials in observed scenes. Theoretical studies suggest that self-dictionary methods using linear programming (LP), known as Hottopixx methods, are effective in extracting endmembers. However, their practical application is hindered by high computational costs, as they require solving LP problems whose size grows quadratically with the number of pixels in the image. As a result, their actual effectiveness remains unclear. To address this issue, we propose an enhanced implementation of Hottopixx designed to reduce computational time and improve endmember extraction performance. We demonstrate its effectiveness through experiments. The results suggest that our implementation enables the application of Hottopixx for endmember extraction from real hyperspectral images and allows us to achieve reasonably high accuracy in estimating endmember signatures.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches require separate translators for each language pair, leading to exponential complexity growth. CrossTL uses a single universal IR to facilitate translations between CUDA, HIP, Metal, DirectX HLSL, OpenGL GLSL, Vulkan SPIR-V, Rust, and Mojo, with Slang support in development. Our system consists of: language-specific lexers/parsers converting source code to ASTs, bidirectional CrossGL translation modules implementing ToCrossGLConverter classes for importing code and CodeGen classes for target generation, and comprehensive backend implementations handling full translation pipelines. We demonstrate effectiveness through comprehensive evaluation across programming domains, achieving successful compilation and execution across all supported backends. The universal IR design enables adding new languages with minimal effort, requiring only language-specific frontend/backend components. Our contributions include: (1) a unified IR capturing semantics of multiple programming paradigms, (2) a modular architecture enabling extensibility, (3) a comprehensive framework supporting GPU compute, graphics programming, and systems languages, and (4) empirical validation demonstrating practical viability of universal code translation. CrossTL represents a significant step toward language-agnostic programming, enabling write-once, deploy-everywhere development.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 Pa...</summary><p>15 Pages, 5 Figures, 1 Table.

| **[Active Learning for Neurosymbolic Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15750v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The goal of active learning for program synthesis is to synthesize the desired program by asking targeted questions that minimize user interaction. While prior work has explored active learning in the purely symbolic setting, such techniques are inadequate for the increasingly popular paradigm of neurosymbolic program synthesis, where the synthesized program incorporates neural components. When applied to the neurosymbolic setting, such techniques can -- and, in practice, do -- return an unintended program due to mispredictions of neural components. This paper proposes a new active learning technique that can handle the unique challenges posed by neural network mispredictions. Our approach is based upon a new evaluation strategy called constrained conformal evaluation (CCE), which accounts for neural mispredictions while taking into account user-provided feedback. Our proposed method iteratively makes CCE more precise until all remaining programs are guaranteed to be observationally equivalent. We have implemented this method in a tool called SmartLabel and experimentally evaluated it on three neurosymbolic domains. Our results demonstrate that SmartLabel identifies the ground truth program for 98% of the benchmarks, requiring under 5 rounds of user interaction on average. In contrast, prior techniques for active learning are only able to converge to the ground truth program for at most 65% of the benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Program Semantic Inequivalence Game with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03818v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve strong performance on everyday coding tasks, but they can fail on complex tasks that require non-trivial reasoning about program semantics. Finding training examples to teach LLMs to solve these tasks can be challenging. In this work, we explore a method to synthetically generate code reasoning training data based on a semantic inequivalence game SInQ: a generator agent creates program variants that are semantically distinct, derived from a dataset of real-world programming tasks, while an evaluator agent has to identify input examples that cause the original programs and the generated variants to diverge in their behaviour, with the agents training each other semi-adversarially. We prove that this setup enables theoretically unlimited improvement through self-play in the limit of infinite computational resources. We evaluated our approach on multiple code generation and understanding benchmarks, including cross-language vulnerability detection (Lu et al., 2021), where our method improves vulnerability detection in C/C++ code despite being trained exclusively on Python code, and the challenging Python builtin identifier swap benchmark (Miceli-Barone et al., 2023), showing that whereas modern LLMs still struggle with this benchmark, our approach yields substantial improvements. We release the code needed to replicate the experiments, as well as the generated synthetic data, which can be used to fine-tune LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Static Factorisation of Probabilistic Programs With User-Labelled Sample Statements and While Loops](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20922v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It is commonly known that any Bayesian network can be implemented as a probabilistic program, but the reverse direction is not so clear. In this work, we address the open question to what extent a probabilistic program with user-labelled sample statements and while loops - features found in languages like Gen, Turing, and Pyro - can be represented graphically. To this end, we extend existing operational semantics to support these language features. By translating a program to its control-flow graph, we define a sound static analysis that approximates the dependency structure of the random variables in the program. As a result, we obtain a static factorisation of the implicitly defined program density, which is equivalent to the known Bayesian network factorisation for programs without loops and constant labels, but constitutes a novel graphical representation for programs that define an unbounded number of random variables via loops or dynamic labels. We further develop a sound program slicing technique to leverage this structure to statically enable three well-known optimisations for the considered program class: we reduce the variance of gradient estimates in variational inference and we speed up both single-site Metropolis Hastings and sequential Monte Carlo. These optimisations are proven correct and empirically shown to match or outperform existing techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Genetic Informed Trees (GIT*): Path Planning via Reinforced Genetic Programming Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20871v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal path planning involves finding a feasible state sequence between a start and a goal that optimizes an objective. This process relies on heuristic functions to guide the search direction. While a robust function can improve search efficiency and solution quality, current methods often overlook available environmental data and simplify the function structure due to the complexity of information relationships. This study introduces Genetic Informed Trees (GIT*), which improves upon Effort Informed Trees (EIT*) by integrating a wider array of environmental data, such as repulsive forces from obstacles and the dynamic importance of vertices, to refine heuristic functions for better guidance. Furthermore, we integrated reinforced genetic programming (RGP), which combines genetic programming with reward system feedback to mutate genotype-generative heuristic functions for GIT*. RGP leverages a multitude of data types, thereby improving computational efficiency and solution quality within a set timeframe. Comparative analyses demonstrate that GIT* surpasses existing single-query, sampling-based planners in problems ranging from R^4 to R^16 and was tested on a real-world mobile manipulation task.

Our starting points are the proof systems eLDT and eLNDT, for BPs and NBPs respectively, previously introduced by Buss, Das and Knop. We prove polynomial equivalences between these proof systems and the corresponding games we introduce. This crucially requires access to a form of negation of branching programs which, for NBPs, requires us to formalise a non-uniform version of the Immerman-Szelepcsenyi theorem that coNL = NL. Thanks to the techniques developed, we further obtain a proof complexity theoretic version of Immerman-Szelepcsenyi, showing that eLNDT is polynomially equivalent to systems over boundedly alternating branching programs.</p></details> | 34 pages, 8 figures |

While supervised approaches have achieved superior performance, they are constrained by the scarcity and high annotation costs of 3D vision-language datasets. Training-free approaches based on LLMs/VLMs eliminate the need for large-scale training data, but they either incur prohibitive grounding time and token costs or have unsatisfactory accuracy. To address the challenges, we introduce a novel method for training-free 3D visual grounding, namely Language-to-Space Programming (LaSP). LaSP introduces LLM-generated codes to analyze 3D spatial relations among objects, along with a pipeline that evaluates and optimizes the codes automatically. Experimental results demonstrate that LaSP achieves 52.9% accuracy on the Nr3D benchmark, ranking among the best training-free methods. Moreover, it substantially reduces the grounding time and token costs, offering a balanced trade-off between performance and efficiency.</p></details> |  |

At the same time, their security has increasingly been acknowledged as a problem. To this end, the paper examines the previously overlooked longitudinal aspects of software ecosystem security, focusing on malware uploaded to six popular programming language ecosystems. The dataset examined is based on the new Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV) database. According to the results, records about detected malware uploads in the database have recently surpassed those addressing vulnerabilities in packages distributed in the ecosystems. In the early 2025 even up to 80% of all entries in the OSV have been about malware. Regarding time series analysis of malware frequencies and their shares to all database entries, good predictions are available already by relatively simple autoregressive models using the numbers of ecosystems, security advisories, and media and other articles as predictors. With these results and the accompanying discussion, the paper improves and advances the understanding of the thus far overlooked longitudinal aspects of ecosystems and malware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proce...</summary><p>Proceedings of the 20th International Conference on Availability, Reliability and Security (ARES 2025), Ghent, Springer, pp. 269-285.

| **[Solvable Tuple Patterns and Their Applications to Program Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20365v1)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the recent progress of automated program verification techniques, fully automated verification of programs manipulating recursive data structures remains a challenge. We introduce the notion of solvable tuple patterns (STPs) to express invariants between list-like recursive data structures. A distinguishing feature of STPs is that they can be efficiently inferred from only a small number of positive samples; no negative samples are required. An SMT solver that supports the sequence theory can be used to check that an inferred STP is indeed an inductive invariant. After presenting basic properties of STPs and an STP inference algorithm, we show how to incorporate the STP inference into a CHC (Constrained Horn Clauses) solver supporting list-like data structures, which serves as a uniform backend for automated program verification tools. A CHC solver incorporating the STP inference has won the ADT-LIN category of CHC-COMP 2025 by a big margin.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Automated Loop Invariant Generation for Complex Programs with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10483v2)** | 2025-08-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program verification has always been an important component of building trustworthy software. While the analysis of real-world programs remains a theoretical challenge, the automation of loop invariant analysis has effectively resolved the problem. However, real-world programs that often mix complex data structures and control flows pose challenges to traditional loop invariant generation tools. To enhance the applicability of invariant generation techniques, we proposed ACInv, an Automated Complex program loop Invariant generation tool, which combines static analysis with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate the proper loop invariants. We utilize static analysis to extract the necessary information for each loop and embed it into prompts for the LLM to generate invariants for each loop. Subsequently, we employ an LLM-based evaluator to assess the generated invariants, refining them by either strengthening, weakening, or rejecting them based on their correctness, ultimately obtaining enhanced invariants. We conducted experiments on ACInv, which showed that ACInv outperformed previous tools on data sets with data structures, and maintained similar performance to the state-of-the-art tool AutoSpec on numerical programs without data structures. For the total data set, ACInv can solve 21% more examples than AutoSpec and can generate reference data structure templates.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Quantum One-Time Programs, Revisited](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.01876v3)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-time programs (Goldwasser, Kalai and Rothblum, CRYPTO 2008) are functions that can be run on any single input of a user's choice, but not on a second input. Classically, they are unachievable without trusted hardware, but the destructive nature of quantum measurements seems to provide a quantum path to constructing them. Unfortunately, Broadbent, Gutoski and Stebila showed that even with quantum techniques, a strong notion of one-time programs, similar to ideal obfuscation, cannot be achieved for any non-trivial quantum function. On the positive side, Ben-David and Sattath (Quantum, 2023) showed how to construct a one-time program for a certain (probabilistic) digital signature scheme, under a weaker notion of one-time program security. There is a vast gap between achievable and provably impossible notions of one-time program security, and it is unclear what functionalities are one-time programmable under the achievable notions of security. In this work, we present new, meaningful, yet achievable definitions of one-time program security for probabilistic classical functions. We show how to construct one time programs satisfying these definitions for all functions in the classical oracle model and for constrained pseudorandom functions in the plain model. Finally, we examine the limits of these notions: we show a class of functions which cannot be one-time programmed in the plain model, as well as a class of functions which appears to be highly random given a single query, but whose one-time program form leaks the entire function even in the oracle model.</p></details> | <details><summary>minor...</summary><p>minor revision; in STOC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for Search Tree Size Minimization in Constraint Programming: New Results on Scheduling Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20056v1)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Failure-Directed Search (FDS) is a significant complete generic search algorithm used in Constraint Programming (CP) to efficiently explore the search space, proven particularly effective on scheduling problems. This paper analyzes FDS's properties, showing that minimizing the size of its search tree guided by ranked branching decisions is closely related to the Multi-armed bandit (MAB) problem. Building on this insight, MAB reinforcement learning algorithms are applied to FDS, extended with problem-specific refinements and parameter tuning, and evaluated on the two most fundamental scheduling problems, the Job Shop Scheduling Problem (JSSP) and Resource-Constrained Project Scheduling Problem (RCPSP). The resulting enhanced FDS, using the best extended MAB algorithm and configuration, performs 1.7 times faster on the JSSP and 2.1 times faster on the RCPSP benchmarks compared to the original implementation in a new solver called OptalCP, while also being 3.5 times faster on the JSSP and 2.1 times faster on the RCPSP benchmarks than the current state-of-the-art FDS algorithm in IBM CP Optimizer 22.1. Furthermore, using only a 900-second time limit per instance, the enhanced FDS improved the existing state-of-the-art lower bounds of 78 of 84 JSSP and 226 of 393 RCPSP standard open benchmark instances while also completely closing a few of them.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthesizing High-Quality Programming Tasks with LLM-based Expert and Student Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07655v2)** | 2025-08-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI is transforming computing education by enabling the automatic generation of personalized content and feedback. We investigate its capabilities in providing high-quality programming tasks to students. Despite promising advancements in task generation, a quality gap remains between AI-generated and expert-created tasks. The AI-generated tasks may not align with target programming concepts, could be incomprehensible to students, or may contain critical issues such as incorrect tests. Existing works often require interventions from human teachers for validation. We address these challenges by introducing PyTaskSyn, a novel synthesis technique that first generates a programming task and then decides whether it meets certain quality criteria to be given to students. The key idea is to break this process into multiple stages performed by expert and student agents simulated using both strong and weaker generative models. Through extensive evaluation, we show that PyTaskSyn significantly improves task quality compared to baseline techniques and showcases the importance of each specialized agent type in our validation pipeline. Additionally, we conducted user studies using our publicly available web application and show that PyTaskSyn can deliver high-quality programming tasks comparable to expert-designed ones while reducing workload and costs, and being more engaging than programming tasks that are available in online resources.</p></details> | AIED'25 paper |

To this end, we make at least four new major contributions. First, we introduce DAMOV, the first rigorous methodology to characterize memory-related data movement bottlenecks in modern workloads, and the first data movement benchmark suite. Second, we introduce MIMDRAM, a new hardware/software co-designed substrate that addresses the major current programmability and flexibility limitations of the bulk bitwise execution model of processing-using-DRAM (PUD) architectures. MIMDRAM enables the allocation and control of only the needed computing resources inside DRAM for PUD computing. Third, we introduce Proteus, the first hardware framework that addresses the high execution latency of bulk bitwise PUD operations in state-of-the-art PUD architectures by implementing a data-aware runtime engine for PUD. Proteus reduces the latency of PUD operations in three different ways: (i) Proteus concurrently executes independent in-DRAM primitives belong to a single PUD operation across DRAM arrays. (ii) Proteus dynamically reduces the bit-precision (and consequentially the latency and energy consumption) of PUD operations by exploiting narrow values (i.e., values with many leading zeros or ones). (iii) Proteus chooses and uses the most appropriate data representation and arithmetic algorithm implementation for a given PUD instruction transparently to the programmer. Fourth, we introduce DaPPA (data-parallel processing-in-memory architecture), a new programming framework that eases programmability for general-purpose PNM architectures by allowing the programmer to write efficient PIM-friendly code without the need to manage hardware resources explicitly.</p></details> | Doctoral thesis |
| **[QAgent: An LLM-based Multi-Agent System for Autonomous OpenQASM programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20134v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices have begun to exhibit early quantum advantages on classically intractable problems, spanning physics simulations to Gaussian boson sampling. Yet, realizing these benefits remains challenging for non-experts, primarily due to the complexities of programming in Open Quantum Assembly Language (OpenQASM). Although Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shown promise in automating classical programming workflows, their quantum counterparts have largely been restricted to specialized tasks such as quantum chemistry or error correction. In this paper, we present QAgent, an LLM-powered multi-agent system that fully automates OpenQASM programming. By integrating task planning, in-context few-shot learning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for long-term context, predefined generation tools, and chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning, the agents systematically improve both compilation and functional correctness. Our evaluations demonstrate substantial improvements: across multiple LLMs of varying sizes, QAgent enhances the accuracy of QASM code generation by 71.6\% compared to previous static LLM-based approaches. We envision this multi-agent system as a key enabler for democratizing quantum programming, bridging expertise gaps, and accelerating the practical adoption of quantum computing.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Slice-Based Change Impact Analysis for Regression Test Case Prioritization of Object-Oriented Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19056v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test case prioritization focuses on finding a suitable order of execution of the test cases in a test suite to meet some performance goals like detecting faults early. It is likely that some test cases execute the program parts that are more prone to errors and will detect more errors if executed early during the testing process. Finding an optimal order of execution for the selected regression test cases saves time and cost of retesting. This paper presents a static approach to prioritizing the test cases by computing the affected component coupling (ACC) of the affected parts of object-oriented programs. We construct a graph named affected slice graph (ASG) to represent these affected program parts.We determine the fault-proneness of the nodes of ASG by computing their respective ACC values. We assign higher priority to those test cases that cover the nodes with higher ACC values. Our analysis with mutation faults shows that the test cases executing the fault-prone program parts have a higher chance to reveal faults earlier than other test cases in the test suite. The result obtained from seven case studies justifies that our approach is feasible and gives acceptable performance in comparison to some existing techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraint Matters: Multi-Modal Representation for Reducing Mixed-Integer Linear programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18742v1)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction, which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation time by 17.47\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Redundancy-based Automated Program Repair by Fine-grained Pattern Mining](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15955v3)** | 2025-08-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Redundancy-based automated program repair (APR), which generates patches by referencing existing source code, has gained much attention since they are effective in repairing real-world bugs with good interpretability. However, since existing approaches either demand the existence of multi-line similar code or randomly reference existing code, they can only repair a small number of bugs with many incorrect patches, hindering their wide application in practice. In this work, we aim to improve the effectiveness of redundancy-based APRs by exploring more effective source code reuse methods for improving the number of correct patches and reducing incorrect patches. Specifically, we have proposed a new repair technique named Repatt, which incorporates a two-level pattern mining process for guiding effective patch generation (i.e., token and expression levels). We have conducted an extensive experiment on the widely-used Defects4J benchmark and compared Repatt with ten state-of-the-art APR approaches. The results show that it complements existing approaches by repairing 9 unique bugs compared with the latest Large Language Model (LLM)-based and deep learning-based methods and 19 unique bugs compared with traditional repair methods when providing the perfect fault localization. In addition, when the perfect fault localization is unknown in real practice, Repatt significantly outperforms the baseline approaches by achieving much higher patch precision, i.e., 83.8\%, although it repairs fewer bugs. Moreover, we further proposed an effective patch ranking strategy for combining the strength of Repatt and the baseline methods. The result shows that it repairs 124 bugs when only considering the Top-1 patches and improves the best-performing repair method by repairing 39 more bugs. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach for practical use.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted by ICSME 2025</p></details> |
| **[Reformulations of Quadratic Programs for Lipschitz Continuity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18530v1)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization-based controllers often lack regularity guarantees, such as Lipschitz continuity, when multiple constraints are present. When used to control a dynamical system, these conditions are essential to ensure the existence and uniqueness of the system's trajectory. Here we propose a general method to convert a Quadratic Program (QP) into a Second-Order Cone Problem (SOCP), which is shown to be Lipschitz continuous. Key features of our approach are that (i) the regularity of the resulting formulation does not depend on the structural properties of the constraints, such as the linear independence of their gradients; and (ii) it admits a closed-form solution, which is not available for general QPs with multiple constraints, enabling faster computation. We support our method with rigorous analysis and examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Control Systems Letters (L-CSS)</p></details> |
| **[Data-Driven Discovery of Interpretable Kalman Filter Variants through Large Language Models and Genetic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11703v2)** | 2025-08-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Algorithmic discovery has traditionally relied on human ingenuity and extensive experimentation. Here we investigate whether a prominent scientific computing algorithm, the Kalman Filter, can be discovered through an automated, data-driven, evolutionary process that relies on Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP) and Large Language Models (LLM). We evaluate the contributions of both modalities (CGP and LLM) in discovering the Kalman filter under varying conditions. Our results demonstrate that our framework of CGP and LLM-assisted evolution converges to near-optimal solutions when Kalman optimality assumptions hold. When these assumptions are violated, our framework evolves interpretable alternatives that outperform the Kalman filter. These results demonstrate that combining evolutionary algorithms and generative models for interpretable, data-driven synthesis of simple computational modules is a potent approach for algorithmic discovery in scientific computing.</p></details> |  |

Building on recent published work [1], we demonstrate here, for the first time, that microrobotic smartlets, hitherto buoyancy divers, can also be equipped to navigate in 2D on surfaces, with on-board control responding to both sensor information and their internal electronic program. Fabricating modular microrobots, with all dimensions of 1mm and below, has been difficult to achieve because of competing demands for the limited surface area and the challenges of integrating and interconnecting the diverse functionalities of energy harvesting, actuation, sensing, communication, docking and control. A novel high density heterogeneous integration, via soft-substrate micro flip-chip bonding of custom CMOS and LED microchiplets onto fold-up polymer surfaces, compatible with roll-up isotropic ambient light harvesting, now makes this possible. Fabricating electrolytic bubble actuators on multiple cube-faces and connecting them to a custom sensor-controlled on-board microchiplet (lablet), allows the smartlets to locomote on wet surfaces, changing direction in response to both timed programmed control as well as programmed response to locally sensed signals. Such locomoted robotic microcubes can also move to and selectively dock with other modules via patterned surfaces. This is powered by ambient light in natural aqueous media on smooth surfaces.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeeP-Mod: Deep Dynamic Programming based Environment Modelling using Feature Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20535v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The DeeP-Mod framework builds an environment model using features from a Deep Dynamic Programming Network (DDPN), trained via a Deep Q-Network (DQN). While Deep Q-Learning is effective in decision-making, state information is lost in deeper DQN layers due to mixed state-action representations. We address this by using Dynamic Programming (DP) to train a DDPN, where Value Iteration ensures the output represents state values, not state-action pairs. Extracting features from the DDPN preserves state information, enabling task and action set independence. We show that a reduced DDPN can be trained using features extracted from the original DDPN trained on an identical problem. This reduced DDPN achieves faster convergence under noise and outperforms the original DDPN. Finally, we introduce the DeeP-Mod framework, which creates an environment model using the evolution of features extracted from a DDPN in response to actions. A second DDPN, which learns directly from this feature model rather than raw states, can learn an effective feature-value representation and thus optimal policy. A key advantage of DeeP-Mod is that an externally defined environment model is not needed at any stage, making DDPN applicable to a wide range of environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an author's version.

| **[Borrowing Dirty Qubits in Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.17190v1)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dirty qubits are ancillary qubits that can be borrowed from idle parts of a computation, enabling qubit reuse and reducing the demand for fresh, clean qubits-a resource that is typically scarce in practice. For such reuse to be valid, the initial states of the dirty qubits must not affect the functionality of the quantum circuits in which they are employed. Moreover, their original states, including any entanglement they possess, must be fully restored after use-a requirement commonly known as safe uncomputation. In this paper, we formally define the semantics of dirty-qubit borrowing as a feature in quantum programming languages, and introduce a notion of safe uncomputation for dirty qubits in quantum programs. We also present an efficient algorithm, along with experimental results, for verifying safe uncomputation of dirty qubits in certain quantum circuits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chemical classification program synthesis using generative artificial intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18470v2)** | 2025-08-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately classifying chemical structures is essential for cheminformatics and bioinformatics, including tasks such as identifying bioactive compounds of interest, screening molecules for toxicity to humans, finding non-organic compounds with desirable material properties, or organizing large chemical libraries for drug discovery or environmental monitoring. However, manual classification is labor-intensive and difficult to scale to large chemical databases. Existing automated approaches either rely on manually constructed classification rules, or are deep learning methods that lack explainability. This work presents an approach that uses generative artificial intelligence to automatically write chemical classifier programs for classes in the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) database. These programs can be used for efficient deterministic run-time classification of SMILES structures, with natural language explanations. The programs themselves constitute an explainable computable ontological model of chemical class nomenclature, which we call the ChEBI Chemical Class Program Ontology (C3PO). We validated our approach against the ChEBI database, and compared our results against deep learning models and a naive SMARTS pattern based classifier. C3PO outperforms the naive classifier, but does not reach the performance of state of the art deep learning methods. However, C3PO has a number of strengths that complement deep learning methods, including explainability and reduced data dependence. C3PO can be used alongside deep learning classifiers to provide an explanation of the classification, where both methods agree. The programs can be used as part of the ontology development process, and iteratively refined by expert human curators.</p></details> |  |
