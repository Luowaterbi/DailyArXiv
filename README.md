| **[Nearly Tight Lower Bounds for Relaxed Locally Decodable Codes via Robust Daisies](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21659v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show a nearly optimal lower bound on the length of linear relaxed locally decodable codes (RLDCs). Specifically, we prove that any $q$-query linear RLDC $C\colon \{0,1\}^k \to \{0,1\}^n$ must satisfy $n = k^{1+Ω(1/q)}$. This bound closely matches the known upper bound of $n = k^{1+O(1/q)}$ by Ben-Sasson, Goldreich, Harsha, Sudan, and Vadhan (STOC 2004). Our proof introduces the notion of robust daisies, which are relaxed sunflowers with pseudorandom structure, and leverages a new spread lemma to extract dense robust daisies from arbitrary distributions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Test Driven Development with Large Language Models for Reliable and Verifiable Spreadsheet Code Generation: A Research Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15585v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly leveraged for generating both traditional software code and spreadsheet logic. Despite their impressive generative capabilities, these models frequently exhibit critical issues such as hallucinations, subtle logical inconsistencies, and syntactic errors, risks particularly acute in high stakes domains like financial modelling and scientific computations, where accuracy and reliability are paramount. This position paper proposes a structured research framework that integrates the proven software engineering practice of Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Large Language Model (LLM) driven generation to enhance the correctness of, reliability of, and user confidence in generated outputs. We hypothesise that a "test first" methodology provides both technical constraints and cognitive scaffolding, guiding LLM outputs towards more accurate, verifiable, and comprehensible solutions. Our framework, applicable across diverse programming contexts, from spreadsheet formula generation to scripting languages such as Python and strongly typed languages like Rust, includes an explicitly outlined experimental design with clearly defined participant groups, evaluation metrics, and illustrative TDD based prompting examples. By emphasising test driven thinking, we aim to improve computational thinking, prompt engineering skills, and user engagement, particularly benefiting spreadsheet users who often lack formal programming training yet face serious consequences from logical errors. We invite collaboration to refine and empirically evaluate this approach, ultimately aiming to establish responsible and reliable LLM integration in both educational and professional development practices.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Phase-Aware Code-Aided EM Algorithm for Blind Channel Estimation in PSK-Modulated OFDM](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21340v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a fully blind phase-aware expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm for OFDM systems with the phase-shift keying (PSK) modulation. We address the well-known local maximum problem of the EM algorithm for blind channel estimation. This is primarily caused by the unknown phase ambiguity in the channel estimates, which conventional blind EM estimators cannot resolve. To overcome this limitation, we propose to exploit the extrinsic information from the decoder as model evidence metrics. A finite set of candidate models is generated based on the inherent symmetries of PSK modulation, and the decoder selects the most likely candidate model. Simulation results demonstrate that, when combined with a simple convolutional code, the phase-aware EM algorithm reliably resolves phase ambiguity during the initialization stage and reduces the local convergence rate from 80% to nearly 0% in frequency-selective channels with a constant phase ambiguity. The algorithm is invoked only once after the EM initialization stage, resulting in negligible additional complexity during subsequent turbo iterations.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[Quo Vadis, Code Review? Exploring the Future of Code Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.06879v4)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review has long been a core practice in collaborative software engineering, yet its future trajectory is unclear. In this research, we examine how professional developers experience code review today and what changes they anticipate in the next five years. We conducted a survey with 100 developers from five software-driven companies, capturing current review effort, reviewed artifacts, and expectations about future practice. Practitioners expect code review to remain essential, with similar or greater effort and a broader range of artifacts under review. At the same time, almost all expect LLMs to become active participants in code review. With this new participant in code review, we see long-term risks of eroding human understanding, accountability, and trust. Code review may therefore act as a lens through which the challenges of AI in software engineering become visible first.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to JSS New Ideas and Trends Papers</p></details> |
| **[Empirical Assessment of the Code Comprehension Effort Needed to Attack Programs Protected with Obfuscation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21301v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the effectiveness of software protection is crucial for selecting the most effective methods to safeguard assets within software applications. Obfuscation involves techniques that deliberately modify software to make it more challenging to understand and reverse-engineer, while maintaining its original functionality. Although obfuscation is widely adopted, its effectiveness remains largely unexplored and unthoroughly evaluated. This paper presents a controlled experiment involving Master's students performing code comprehension tasks on applications hardened with obfuscation. The experiment's goals are to assess the effectiveness of obfuscation in delaying code comprehension by attackers and to determine whether complexity metrics can accurately predict the impact of these protections on success rates and durations of code comprehension tasks. The study is the first to evaluate the effect of layering multiple obfuscation techniques on a single piece of protected code. It also provides experimental evidence of the correlation between objective metrics of the attacked code and the likelihood of a successful attack, bridging the gap between objective and subjective approaches to estimating potency. Finally, the paper highlights significant aspects that warrant additional analysis and opens new avenues for further experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[QiMeng-SALV: Signal-Aware Learning for Verilog Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19296v3)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules. Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset. Our code is available at https://github.com/zy1xxx/SALV.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[From Code Smells to Best Practices: Tackling Resource Leaks in PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15229v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Much of the existing ML research focuses on model performance metrics, leaving limited attention to the long-term sustainability and resource efficiency of ML applications. While high performance is essential, ensuring efficient resource management is equally critical for robust deployment. This study addresses this gap by systematically identifying code smells that lead to resource leaks in ML applications. We conducted an empirical investigation of developer discussions and real-world code snippets from PyTorch, TensorFlow, and Keras. The analysis identified 30 PyTorch-related smells and 16 TensorFlow/Keras smells linked to resource leaks. These smells were categorized in two ways: (1) based on their root causes, and (2) as general ML smells with framework-specific characteristics. For each smell, we derived at least one best practice, resulting in 50 recommended coding patterns aimed at reducing resource leakage and improving efficiency. To ensure the validity of our findings, we employed a three-phase validation process involving independent analysis by three authors followed by consensus discussions. This is the first comprehensive study to examine resource-leak-inducing code smells across major ML frameworks and to present actionable best practices for mitigating them. The contributions support developers in building more efficient and sustainable ML applications and offer a structured view of the underlying causes of resource leaks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Codes Kernelization Limitations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21067v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Identifying Code (IC) problem seeks a vertex subset whose intersection with every vertex's closed neighborhood is unique, enabling fault detection in multiprocessor systems and practical uses in identity verification, environmental monitoring, and dynamic localization. A closely related problem is the Locating-Dominating Set (LD), which requires each non-dominating vertex to be uniquely identified by its intersection with the set. Cappelle, Gomes, and Santos (2021) proved that LD is W-hard for minimum clique cover and lacks polynomial kernels for parameters such as vertex cover, but their methods did not apply to IC. This paper answers their question by showing that IC does not admit a polynomial kernel parameterized by solution size plus vertex cover unless NP is a subset of coNP/poly.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Evaluation of Software Design Capabilities of Large Language Models of Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20933v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are being increasingly adopted in the software engineering domain, yet the robustness of their grasp on core software design concepts remains unclear. We conduct an empirical study to systematically evaluate their understanding of cohesion (intra-module) and coupling (inter-module). We programmatically generate poorly designed code fragments and test the DeepSeek-R1 model family ($14$B, $32$B, $70$B) under varying levels of guidance, from simple \textit{Verification} to \textit{Guided} and \textit{Open-ended Generation}, while varying contextual noise by injecting distractor elements. While models exhibit a solid baseline understanding of both concepts in ideal conditions, their practical knowledge is fragile and highly asymmetrical. Reasoning about coupling proves brittle; performance collapses in noisy, open-ended scenarios, with F1 scores dropping by over $50\%$. In contrast, the models' analysis of cohesion is remarkably robust to internal noise in guided tasks, showing little performance degradation. However, this resilience also fails when all guidance is removed. Reasoning-trace analysis confirms these failure modes, revealing \textit{cognitive shortcutting} for coupling versus a more exhaustive (yet still failing) analysis for cohesion. To summarize, while LLMs can provide reliable assistance for recognizing design flaws, their ability to reason autonomously in noisy, realistic contexts is limited, highlighting the critical need for more scalable and robust program understanding capabilities.</p></details> | 18 figures |
| **[Reductions Between Code Equivalence Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07916v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper we present two reductions between variants of the Code Equivalence problem. We give polynomial-time Karp reductions from Permutation Code Equivalence (PCE) to both Linear Code Equivalence (LCE) and Signed Permutation Code Equivalence (SPCE). Along with a Karp reduction from SPCE to the Lattice Isomorphism Problem (LIP) proved in a paper by Bennett and Win (2024), our second result implies a reduction from PCE to LIP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Supporting Students in Navigating LLM-Generated Insecure Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20878v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly large language models (LLMs), has revolutionized software development by enabling developers to specify tasks in natural language and receive corresponding code, boosting productivity. However, this shift also introduces security risks, as LLMs may generate insecure code that can be exploited by adversaries. Current educational approaches emphasize efficiency while overlooking these risks, leaving students underprepared to identify and mitigate security issues in AI-assisted workflows. To address this gap, we present Bifröst, an educational framework that cultivates security awareness in AI-augmented development. Bifröst integrates (1) a Visual Studio Code extension simulating realistic environments, (2) adversarially configured LLMs that generate insecure code, and (3) a feedback system highlighting vulnerabilities. By immersing students in tasks with compromised LLMs and providing targeted security analysis, Bifröst cultivates critical evaluation skills; classroom deployments (n=61) show vulnerability to insecure code, while a post-intervention survey (n=21) indicates increased skepticism toward LLM outputs.</p></details> | 7 pages |
| **[Relaxed vs. Full Local Decodability with Few Queries: Equivalence and Separations for Linear Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02633v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A locally decodable code (LDC) $C \colon \{0,1\}^k \to \{0,1\}^n$ is an error-correcting code that allows one to recover any bit of the original message with good probability while only reading a small number of bits from a corrupted codeword. A relaxed locally decodable code (RLDC) is a weaker notion where the decoder is additionally allowed to abort and output a special symbol $\bot$ if it detects an error. For a large constant number of queries $q$, there is a large gap between the blocklength $n$ of the best $q$-query LDC and the best $q$-query RLDC. Existing constructions of RLDCs achieve polynomial length $n = k^{1 + O(1/q)}$, while the best-known $q$-LDCs only achieve subexponential length $n = 2^{k^{o(1)}}$. On the other hand, for $q = 2$, it is known that RLDCs and LDCs are equivalent. We thus ask the question: what is the smallest $q$ such that there exists a $q$-RLDC that is not a $q$-LDC? In this work, we show that any linear $3$-query RLDC is in fact a $3$-LDC, i.e., linear RLDCs and LDCs are equivalent at $3$ queries. More generally, we show for any constant $q$, there is a soundness error threshold $s(q)$ such that any linear $q$-RLDC with soundness error below this threshold must be a $q$-LDC. This implies that linear RLDCs cannot have "strong soundness" -- a stricter condition satisfied by linear LDCs that says the soundness error is proportional to the fraction of errors in the corrupted codeword -- unless they are simply LDCs. In addition, we give simple constructions of linear $15$-query RLDCs that are not $q$-LDCs for any constant $q$, showing that for $q = 15$, linear RLDCs and LDCs are not equivalent. We also prove nearly identical results for locally correctable codes and their corresponding relaxed counterpart.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image2Gcode: Image-to-G-code Generation for Additive Manufacturing Using Diffusion-Transformer Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20636v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mechanical design and manufacturing workflows conventionally begin with conceptual design, followed by the creation of a computer-aided design (CAD) model and fabrication through material-extrusion (MEX) printing. This process requires converting CAD geometry into machine-readable G-code through slicing and path planning. While each step is well established, dependence on CAD modeling remains a major bottleneck: constructing object-specific 3D geometry is slow and poorly suited to rapid prototyping. Even minor design variations typically necessitate manual updates in CAD software, making iteration time-consuming and difficult to scale. To address this limitation, we introduce Image2Gcode, an end-to-end data-driven framework that bypasses the CAD stage and generates printer-ready G-code directly from images and part drawings. Instead of relying on an explicit 3D model, a hand-drawn or captured 2D image serves as the sole input. The framework first extracts slice-wise structural cues from the image and then employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) over G-code sequences. Through iterative denoising, the model transforms Gaussian noise into executable print-move trajectories with corresponding extrusion parameters, establishing a direct mapping from visual input to native toolpaths. By producing structured G-code directly from 2D imagery, Image2Gcode eliminates the need for CAD or STL intermediates, lowering the entry barrier for additive manufacturing and accelerating the design-to-fabrication cycle. This approach supports on-demand prototyping from simple sketches or visual references and integrates with upstream 2D-to-3D reconstruction modules to enable an automated pipeline from concept to physical artifact. The result is a flexible, computationally efficient framework that advances accessibility in design iteration, repair workflows, and distributed manufacturing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Vibe Coding Beat Graduate CS Students? An LLM vs. Human Coding Tournament on Market-driven Strategic Planning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20613v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has revolutionized AI-assisted code generation. This rapid development of LLMs has outpaced our ability to properly benchmark them. Prevailing benchmarks emphasize unit-test pass rates and syntactic correctness. Such metrics understate the difficulty of many real-world problems that require planning, optimization, and strategic interaction. We introduce a multi-agent reasoning-driven benchmark based on a real-world logistics optimization problem (Auction, Pickup, and Delivery Problem) that couples competitive auctions with capacity-constrained routing. The benchmark requires building agents that can (i) bid strategically under uncertainty and (ii) optimize planners that deliver tasks while maximizing profit. We evaluate 40 LLM-coded agents (by a wide range of state-of-the-art LLMs under multiple prompting methodologies, including vibe coding) against 17 human-coded agents developed before the advent of LLMs. Our results over 12 double all-play-all tournaments and $\sim 40$k matches demonstrate (i) a clear superiority of human(graduate students)-coded agents: the top 5 spots are consistently won by human-coded agents, (ii) the majority of LLM-coded agents (33 out of 40) are beaten by very simple baselines, and (iii) given the best human solution as an input and prompted to improve upon, the best performing LLM makes the solution significantly worse instead of improving it. Our results highlight a gap in LLMs' ability to produce code that works competitively in the real-world, and motivate new evaluations that emphasize reasoning-driven code synthesis in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[More with Less: An Empirical Study of Turn-Control Strategies for Efficient Coding Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16786v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-powered coding agents, which operate in iterative loops (turns) to solve software engineering tasks, are becoming increasingly powerful. However, their practical deployment is hindered by significant and unpredictable costs. This challenge arises from a combination of factors: quadratically growing token counts with each turn, the high price of models, the large number of turns required for real-world tasks, and the tendency of agents to take inefficient or unnecessary actions. While existing research focuses on optimizing individual turns, the strategic control of the total number of turns remains an underexplored area for managing agent performance and cost. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on SWE-bench using three state-of-the-art models and evaluate the impact of three distinct turn-control strategies: an unrestricted baseline, a fixed-turn limit with reminders, and a novel dynamic-turn strategy that grants extensions on-demand. Our findings first reveal a fundamental trade-off in the unrestricted setting, where no single model excels across performance, cost, and turn efficiency. We then show that a fixed-turn limit, specifically at the 75th percentile of the baseline, serves as a "sweet spot", substantially reducing costs (by 24%-68%) with minimal impact on solve rates. Most significantly, the dynamic-turn strategy consistently outperforms fixed-limit approaches, achieving comparable or better solve rates while further reducing costs by an additional 12%-24% by intelligently allocating resources only to tasks that need them. This work provides the first systematic analysis of turn-control strategies, offering simple yet effective guidelines for developers to balance cost and efficacy. We demonstrate that dynamic resource allocation is a superior, easy-to-implement approach for deploying powerful yet economically viable coding agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoding rank metric Reed-Muller codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04766v3)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, we investigate the decoding of the rank metric Reed--Muller codes introduced by Augot, Couvreur, Lavauzelle and Neri in 2021. These codes are defined from Abelian Galois extensions extending the construction of Gabidulin codes over arbitrary cyclic Galois extensions. We propose a polynomial time algorithm that rests on the structure of Dickson matrices, works on any such code and corrects any error of rank up to half the minimum distance.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Context Compositional Learning via Sparse Coding Transformer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20194v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer architectures have achieved remarkable success across language, vision, and multimodal tasks, and there is growing demand for them to address in-context compositional learning tasks. In these tasks, models solve the target problems by inferring compositional rules from context examples, which are composed of basic components structured by underlying rules. However, some of these tasks remain challenging for Transformers, which are not inherently designed to handle compositional tasks and offer limited structural inductive bias. In this work, inspired by the principle of sparse coding, we propose a reformulation of the attention to enhance its capability for compositional tasks. In sparse coding, data are represented as sparse combinations of dictionary atoms with coefficients that capture their compositional rules. Specifically, we reinterpret the attention block as a mapping of inputs into outputs through projections onto two sets of learned dictionary atoms: an encoding dictionary and a decoding dictionary. The encoding dictionary decomposes the input into a set of coefficients, which represent the compositional structure of the input. To enhance structured representations, we impose sparsity on these coefficients. The sparse coefficients are then used to linearly combine the decoding dictionary atoms to generate the output. Furthermore, to assist compositional generalization tasks, we propose estimating the coefficients of the target problem as a linear combination of the coefficients obtained from the context examples. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on the S-RAVEN and RAVEN datasets. For certain compositional generalization tasks, our method maintains performance even when standard Transformers fail, owing to its ability to learn and apply compositional rules.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[QiMeng-Kernel: Macro-Thinking Micro-Coding Paradigm for LLM-Based High-Performance GPU Kernel Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20100v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing high-performance GPU kernels is critical for AI and scientific computing, but remains challenging due to its reliance on expert crafting and poor portability. While LLMs offer promise for automation, both general-purpose and finetuned LLMs suffer from two fundamental and conflicting limitations: correctness and efficiency. The key reason is that existing LLM-based approaches directly generate the entire optimized low-level programs, requiring exploration of an extremely vast space encompassing both optimization policies and implementation codes. To address the challenge of exploring an intractable space, we propose Macro Thinking Micro Coding (MTMC), a hierarchical framework inspired by the staged optimization strategy of human experts. It decouples optimization strategy from implementation details, ensuring efficiency through high-level strategy and correctness through low-level implementation. Specifically, Macro Thinking employs reinforcement learning to guide lightweight LLMs in efficiently exploring and learning semantic optimization strategies that maximize hardware utilization. Micro Coding leverages general-purpose LLMs to incrementally implement the stepwise optimization proposals from Macro Thinking, avoiding full-kernel generation errors. Together, they effectively navigate the vast optimization space and intricate implementation details, enabling LLMs for high-performance GPU kernel generation. Comprehensive results on widely adopted benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of MTMC on GPU kernel generation in both accuracy and running time. On KernelBench, MTMC achieves near 100% and 70% accuracy at Levels 1-2 and 3, over 50% than SOTA general-purpose and domain-finetuned LLMs, with up to 7.3x speedup over LLMs, and 2.2x over expert-optimized PyTorch Eager kernels. On the more challenging TritonBench, MTMC attains up to 59.64% accuracy and 34x speedup.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |

In particular, we study a class of TECCs with one twist. The parity-check matrices of the TECCs are explicitly given by computing the Weil differentials. Then the sufficient and necessary conditions of self-duality are presented. The minimum distances of the TECCs are also determined. Moreover, examples of MDS, AMDS, self-dual and MDS self-dual TECCs are given. Finally, we calculate the dimensions of the Schur squares of TECCs and show the non-equivalence between TECCs and ECCs/GRS codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI/ML based Joint Source and Channel Coding for HARQ-ACK Payload](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19943v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Channel coding from 2G to 5G has assumed the inputs bits at the physical layer to be uniformly distributed. However, hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK) bits transmitted in the uplink are inherently non-uniformly distributed. For such sources, significant performance gains could be obtained by employing joint source channel coding, aided by deep learning-based techniques. In this paper, we learn a transformer-based encoder using a novel "free-lunch" training algorithm and propose per-codeword power shaping to exploit the source prior at the encoder whilst being robust to small changes in the HARQ-ACK distribution. Furthermore, any HARQ-ACK decoder has to achieve a low negative acknowledgement (NACK) error rate to avoid radio link failures resulting from multiple NACK errors. We develop an extension of the Neyman-Pearson test to a coded bit system with multiple information bits to achieve Unequal Error Protection of NACK over ACK bits at the decoder. Finally, we apply the proposed encoder and decoder designs to a 5G New Radio (NR) compliant uplink setup under a fading channel, describing the optimal receiver design and a low complexity coherent approximation to it. Our results demonstrate 3-6 dB reduction in the average transmit power required to achieve the target error rates compared to the NR baseline, while also achieving a 2-3 dB reduction in the maximum transmit power, thus providing for significant coverage gains and power savings.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 15 figures.

| **[CodeAssistBench (CAB): Dataset & Benchmarking for Multi-turn Chat-Based Code Assistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10646v4)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Programming assistants powered by large language models have improved dramatically, yet existing benchmarks still evaluate them in narrow code-generation settings. Recent efforts such as InfiBench and StackEval rely on Stack Overflow questions and remain limited to single-turn interactions, manually curated data, and isolated snippets rather than full project environments. We introduce CodeAssistBench (CAB), the first benchmark for evaluating multi-turn, project-grounded programming assistance at scale. CAB automatically constructs datasets from GitHub issues tagged as questions, using an LLM-driven pipeline that filters noise, extracts runnable contexts, builds executable containers, and verifies environment correctness. This enables continuous, automated expansion across diverse repositories without manual intervention. Using CAB, we create a testbed of 3,286 real-world issues across 214 repositories, spanning seven languages. Evaluating state-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap: while models achieve 70-83% accuracy on Stack Overflow-style questions, they solve only 16.49% of CAB issues from post-training-cutoff repositories. On a manually validated subset of 149 issues, top models such as Claude Sonnet 4.5 reach only 12.08% correctness. These results highlight a fundamental challenge: current LLMs struggle to provide assistance in realistic, project-specific contexts despite strong performance on traditional Q&A benchmarks. CAB provides a scalable, reproducible framework for advancing research in multi-turn, codebase-grounded programming agents. The benchmark and pipeline are fully automated and publicly available at https://github.com/amazon-science/CodeAssistBench/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Datasets and Benchmarks Track</p></details> |
| **[RPM-MCTS: Knowledge-Retrieval as Process Reward Model with Monte Carlo Tree Search for Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19895v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tree search-based methods have made significant progress in enhancing the code generation capabilities of large language models. However, due to the difficulty in effectively evaluating intermediate algorithmic steps and the inability to locate and timely correct erroneous steps, these methods often generate incorrect code and incur increased computational costs. To tackle these problems, we propose RPM-MCTS, an effective method that utilizes Knowledge-Retrieval as Process Reward Model based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to evaluate intermediate algorithmic steps. By utilizing knowledge base retrieval, RPM-MCTS avoids the complex training of process reward models. During the expansion phase, similarity filtering is employed to remove redundant nodes, ensuring diversity in reasoning paths. Furthermore, our method utilizes sandbox execution feedback to locate erroneous algorithmic steps during generation, enabling timely and targeted corrections. Extensive experiments on four public code generation benchmarks demonstrate that RPM-MCTS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods while achieving an approximately 15% reduction in token consumption. Furthermore, full fine-tuning of the base model using the data constructed by RPM-MCTS significantly enhances its code capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[CodeFuse-CommitEval: Towards Benchmarking LLM's Power on Commit Message and Code Change Inconsistency Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19875v1)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Version control relies on commit messages to convey the rationale for code changes, but these messages are often low quality and, more critically, inconsistent with their diffs-known as message-code inconsistency (MCI). MCIs mislead reviewers, hinder maintenance, contaminate research datasets, and may obscure security patches. Yet, no dedicated benchmark exists to evaluate models for MCI detection. We introduce CODEFUSE-COMMITEVAL, the first benchmark designed for MCI detection using large language models (LLMs). Built on the ApacheCM dataset for diversity and quality, we generate seven types of inconsistent messages through rule-guided mutations of originally consistent commits and apply two-fold validation to verify both positive and negative samples. Using this labeled dataset of message-diff pairs, we evaluate six state-of-the-art open-source LLMs under a vanilla setting and with three augmentation strategies: few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought, and extended context. Results show models detect inconsistent commits more reliably than consistent ones (average Recall 85.95%, Precision 80.28%, Specificity 63.8%); gpt-oss-20B performs best overall but uses over twice the tokens of others. Augmentation effects vary: adjacent context helps larger models but adds noise for smaller ones; few-shot improves accuracy and reduces token use, yet increases universally incorrect predictions; chain-of-thought boosts precision and specificity at the cost of recall and higher token consumption. Type-wise analysis reveals higher detectability for component, file-path, and operation inconsistencies, but lower accuracy and higher token cost for intent-level "purpose" inconsistencies. CODEFUSE-COMMITEVAL provides a rigorous foundation for measuring, comparing, and advancing MCI detection, highlighting the need for richer context and balanced data to capture high-level semantic gaps.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Hierarchical Sparse Transform Coding of 3DGS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22908v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) supports fast, high quality, novel view synthesis but has a heavy memory footprint, making the compression of its model crucial. Current state-of-the-art (SOTA) 3DGS compression methods adopt an anchor-based architecture that pairs the Scaffold-GS representation with conditional entropy coding. However, these methods forego the analysis-synthesis transform, a vital mechanism in visual data compression. As a result, redundancy remains intact in the signal and its removal is left to the entropy coder, which computationally overburdens the entropy coding module, increasing coding latency. Even with added complexity thorough redundancy removal is a task unsuited to an entropy coder. To fix this critical omission, we introduce a Sparsity-guided Hierarchical Transform Coding (SHTC) method, the first study on the end-to-end learned neural transform coding of 3DGS. SHTC applies KLT to decorrelate intra-anchor attributes, followed by quantization and entropy coding, and then compresses KLT residuals with a low-complexity, scene-adaptive neural transform. Aided by the sparsity prior and deep unfolding technique, the learned transform uses only a few trainable parameters, reducing the memory usage. Overall, SHTC achieves an appreciably improved R-D performance and at the same time higher decoding speed over SOTA. Its prior-guided, parameter-efficient design may also inspire low-complexity neural image and video codecs.

We answer this in the affirmative by exhibiting a simple two-step procedure: first uniquely decode $C_2$, then apply a single error/erasure decoding of $C_1$.This shows that the restrictive hypothesis $d_1\ge\tfrac{2}{3}d_{\mathrm{sr}}$ is theoretically unnecessary.The resulting decoder achieves unique decoding up to $\lfloor (d_{\mathrm{sr}}-1)/2\rfloor$ with overall cost $T_2+T_1$, where $T_2$ and $T_1$ are the complexities of the Hamming decoders for $C_2$ and $C_1$, respectively. We further show that this reduction is asymptotically optimal in a black-box model, as any sum-rank decoder must inherently decode the constituent Hamming codes.For BCH or Goppa instantiations over $\F_4$, the decoder runs in $O(\ell^2)$ time.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Yet a core requirement remains unmet: ensuring that generated code is secure without compromising its functional correctness. Existing benchmarks and evaluations for secure code generation fall short-many measure only vulnerability reduction, disregard correctness preservation, or evaluate security and functionality on separate datasets, violating the fundamental need for simultaneous joint evaluation. We present DUALGAUGE, the first fully automated benchmarking framework designed to rigorously evaluate the security and correctness of LLM-generated code in unison. Given the lack of datasets enabling joint evaluation of secure code generation, we also present DUALGAUGE-BENCH, a curated benchmark suite of diverse coding tasks, each paired with manually validated test suites for both security and functionality, designed for full coverage of specification requirements. At the core of DUALGAUGE is an agentic program executor, which runs a program against given tests in sandboxed environments, and an LLM-based evaluator, which assesses both correctness and vulnerability behavior against expected outcomes. We rigorously evaluated and ensured the quality of DUALGAUGE-BENCH and the accuracy of DUALGAUGE, and applied DUALGAUGE to benchmarking ten leading LLMs on DUALGAUGE-BENCH across thousands of test scenarios. Our results reveal critical gaps in correct and secure code generation by these LLMs, for which our open-source system and datasets help accelerate progress via reproducible, scalable, and rigorous evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boundaries of Acceptable Defectiveness: Redefining Surface Code Robustness under Heterogeneous Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22001v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A variety of past research on superconducting qubits shows that these devices exhibit considerable variation and thus cannot be accurately depicted by a uniform noise model. To combat this often unrealistic picture of homogeneous noise in quantum processors during runtime, our work aims to define the boundaries of acceptable defectiveness (BADs), or the upper boundary of a qubit's physical error, past which this defective qubit entirely degrades the logical computation and should be considered faulty and removed from the surface code mapping. Here, we present a simulation framework based on the stabilizer simulation package STIM, that allows for rapid experimentation of quantum error correction (QEC) performance under any arbitrary and unique noise model. Using this tool, QEC circuits using rotated surface codes were generated, sampled, and analyzed from distances 3 to 17, with various defective error rates and outlier defect locations. The results suggest that there are, in fact, boundaries of acceptable defectiveness in which a defective qubit, with a physical error rate $\leq 0.75$, can be left in the lattice with negligible impact on logical error rate given sufficient code distances and proper placement in the lattice. Additionally, when modeling noise as a uniform distribution, the logical error rate shows minimal impact with increasing deviation, with $σ\leq μ$. As a result, we propose that defectiveness of both individual qubits and the overall uniformity of lattice fidelity should not be viewed as all or nothing, but instead as a spectrum. Our research demonstrates how heterogeneity relates to the logical error rate and, through the framework provided, facilitates the development of preliminary goals and metrics for hardware designers to meet to achieve target logical performance with imperfect or nonuniform qubit qualities.</p></details> | 11 pages, 15 figures |

However, we show that high final-answer accuracy often hides unfaithful visual reasoning: models may invoke tools on irrelevant regions or ignore tool outputs entirely, yet still guess the correct answer. In this work, we first propose a faithfulness evaluation protocol that measures whether intermediate visual tool outputs (e.g., crops) actually contain the queried evidence. This reveals that recent visual agents achieve high final-answer accuracy but exhibit low rates of faithful tool-use on visual search benchmarks. We then introduce CodeV, a code-based visual agent trained with Tool-Aware Policy Optimization (TAPO). TAPO is a process-level RL framework that augments GRPO with dense rewards defined directly on visual tool inputs and outputs, rather than on chain-of-thought tokens, making supervision easier to verify and less susceptible to reward hacking. CodeV represents visual tools as executable Python code, and TAPO assigns step-wise rewards based solely on the question and tool output, encouraging both necessary and evidence-consistent tool use. In a two-stage SFT+RL pipeline, CodeV achieves competitive or superior accuracy while substantially increasing faithful tool-use rates on related visual search benchmarks. Beyond visual search, CodeV attains strong performance on a range of multimodal reasoning and math benchmarks, suggesting that explicitly supervising intermediate tool behavior is crucial for building trustworthy, agentic visual reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Computer-aided Characterization of Fundamental Limits of Coded Caching with Linear Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19639v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inspired by prior work by Tian and by Cao and Xu, this paper presents an efficient computer-aided framework to characterize the fundamental limits of coded caching systems under the constraint of linear coding. The proposed framework considers non-Shannon-type inequalities which are valid for representable polymatroids (and hence for linear codes), and leverages symmetric structure and problem-specific constraints of coded caching to reduce the complexity of the linear program. The derived converse bounds are tighter compared to previous known analytic methods, and prove the optimality of some achievable memory-load tradeoff points under the constraint of linear coding placement and delivery. These results seem to indicate that small, structured demand subsets combined with minimal common information constructions may be sufficient to characterize optimal tradeoffs under linear coding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Construction and Decoding of Error--Correcting Codes from Ideal Lattices of Finite Ternary Gamma Semirings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19378v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a new class of error-correcting codes constructed from the ideal lattices of finite commutative ternary Gamma-semirings (TGS). Unlike classical linear or ring-linear codes, which rely on binary operations, TGS codes arise from the intrinsic ternary operation $[x,y,z]$ and the op-plus order that governs coordinatewise absorption. The fundamental parameters of a TGS code are determined by the $k$-ideal structure of the underlying semiring: the dimension is given by the index $|T/I|$, while the minimum distance depends on the minimal nonzero elements of the distributive ideal lattice $L(T)$. This leads to parameter sets that are not achievable over finite fields, group algebras, or standard semiring frameworks. A quotient-based decoding method is developed in which the ternary syndrome $S(c) = Phi(c) + I$ lies in the quotient TGS $T/I$ and partitions the ambient space into cosets determined by ideal absorption. Minimal nonzero lattice elements yield canonical error representatives, producing a decoding procedure that resembles classical syndrome decoding but comes from higher-arity interactions. A concrete finite example illustrates the computation of parameters, the structure of syndrome classes, and the performance of the decoding method. These results show that ternary Gamma-semirings provide a new algebraic foundation for nonlinear, nonbinary, and higher-arity coding theory. Their ideal-lattice structure and ternary quotient behavior generate new decoding mechanisms and error profiles, expanding algebraic coding theory beyond the limitations of classical linear systems.</p></details> |  |

Our core methodology reconfigures the fundamental polarization process by stitching additional structures to enhance the reliability of less reliable information bits in the original code. This approach preserves the polar transformation structure and maintains the same encoding and decoding complexity. Thanks to the flexible configuration, stitched polar codes consistently outperform regular polar codes, effectively solving the performance degradation issue in rate-matched scenarios. Furthermore, we provide theoretical analysis on the weight spectrum and the polarization speed of stitched polar codes to prove their superiority.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-Shot Coding and Applications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19556v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-shot information theory addresses scenarios in source coding and channel coding where the signal blocklength is assumed to be 1. In this case, each source and channel can be used only once, and the sources and channels are arbitrary and not required to be memoryless or ergodic. We study the achievability part of one-shot information theory, i.e., we consider explicit coding schemes in the oneshot scenario. The objective is to derive one-shot achievability results that can imply existing (first-order and second-order) asymptotic results when applied to memoryless sources and channels, or applied to systems with memory that behave ergodically. Poisson functional representation was first proposed as a one-shot channel simulation technique by Li and El Gamal [118] for proving a strong functional representation lemma. It was later extended to the Poisson matching lemma by Li and Anantharam [117], which provided a unified one-shot coding scheme for a broad class of information-theoretic problems. The main contribution of this thesis is to extend the applicability of Poisson functional representation to various more complicated scenarios, where the original version cannot be applied directly and further extensions must be developed.</p></details> | <details><summary>A The...</summary><p>A Thesis for the Degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Information Engineering, The Chinese University of Hong Kong</p></details> |
| **[Rack-Aware MSR Codes with Linear Field Size and Smaller Sub-Packetization for Tolerating Multiple Erasures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18367v3)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an $(n,k,d)$ rack-aware storage model, the system consists of $n$ nodes uniformly distributed across $\bar{n}$ successive racks, such that each rack contains $u$ nodes of equal capacity and the reconstructive degree satisfies $k=\bar{k}u+v$ where $0\leq v\leq u-1$. Suppose there are $h\geq1$ failed nodes in a rack (called the host rack). Then together with its surviving nodes, the host rack downloads recovery data from $\bar{d}$ helper racks and repairs its failed nodes. In this paper, we focus on studying the rack-aware minimum storage generating (MSR) codes for repairing $h$ failed nodes within the same rack. By using the coupled-layer construction with the alignment technique, we construct the first class of rack-aware MSR codes for all $\bar{k}+1\leq\bar{d}\leq\bar{n}-1$ which achieve the small sub-packetization $l=\bar{s}^{\lceil\bar{n}/\bar{s}\rceil}$ where the field size $q$ increases linearly with $n$ and $\bar{s}=\bar{d}-\bar{k}+1$. In addition, these codes achieve optimal repair bandwidth for $1\leq h\leq u-v$, and asymptotically optimal repair bandwidth for $u-v+1\leq h\leq u$. In particular, they achieve optimal access when $h=u-v$. It is worth noting that the existing rack-aware MSR codes which achieve the same sub-packetization $l=\bar{s}^{\lceil\bar{n}/\bar{s}\rceil}$ are only known for the special case of $\bar{d}=\bar{n}-1$, $h=1$, and the field size is much larger than ours. Then, based on our first construction we further develop another class of explicit rack-aware MSR codes with even smaller sub-packetization $l=\bar{s}^{\lceil\bar{n}/(\bar{s}+1)\rceil}$ for all admissible values of $\bar{d}$.</p></details> |  |

We focus on problems in permutation spaces, which are at the core of numerous practical applications of such algorithms, e.g. in scheduling and transportation. Inversion vectors (also called Lehmer codes) are an alternative representation of the permutation space $S_n$ compared to the classical encoding as a vector of $n$ unique entries. In particular, they do not require any constraint handling. Using rigorous mathematical runtime analyses, we compare the efficiency of inversion vector encodings to the classical representation and give theory-guided advice on their choice. Moreover, we link the effect of local changes in the inversion code space to classical measures on permutations like the number of inversions. Finally, through experimental studies on linear ordering and quadratic assignment problems, we demonstrate the practical efficiency of inversion vector encodings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Can Knowledge Improve Security? A Coding-Enhanced Jamming Approach for Semantic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16960v5)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As semantic communication (SemCom) attracts growing attention as a novel communication paradigm, ensuring the security of transmitted semantic information over open wireless channels has become a critical issue. However, traditional encryption methods often introduce significant additional communication overhead to maintain reliability, and conventional learning-based secure SemCom methods typically rely on a channel capacity advantage for the legitimate receiver, which is challenging to guarantee in real-world scenarios. In this paper, we propose a coding-enhanced jamming method that eliminates the need to transmit a secret key by utilizing shared knowledge, which may be part of the training set of the SemCom system, between the legitimate receiver and the transmitter. Specifically, we leverage the shared private knowledge base to generate a set of private digital codebooks in advance using neural network (NN)-based encoders. For each transmission, we encode the transmitted data into a digital sequence Y1 and associate Y1 with a sequence randomly picked from the private codebook, denoted as Y2, through superposition coding. Here, Y1 serves as the outer code and Y2 as the inner code. By optimizing the power allocation between the inner and outer codes, the legitimate receiver can reconstruct the transmitted data using successive decoding based on the shared index of Y2, while the eavesdropper's decoding performance is severely degraded, potentially to the point of random guessing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves security comparable to state-of-the-art approaches while significantly improving the reconstruction performance of the legitimate receiver by more than 1 dB across varying channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and compression ratios.</p></details> |  |

This work focuses on examining and evaluating the security of LLM-generated code, particularly in the context of C/C++. We categorized known vulnerabilities using the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) and, to study their criticality, mapped them to CVEs. We used ten different LLMs for code generation and analyzed the outputs through static analysis. The amount of CWEs present in AI-generated code is concerning. Our findings highlight the need for developers to be cautious when using LLM-generated code. This study provides valuable insights to advance automated code generation and encourage further research in this domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model Unlearning for Source Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17125v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation, their inherent tendency toward verbatim memorization of training data introduces critical risks like copyright infringement, insecure emission, and deprecated API utilization, etc. A straightforward yet promising defense is unlearning, ie., erasing or down-weighting the offending snippets through post-training. However, we find its application to source code often tends to spill over, damaging the basic knowledge of programming languages learned by the LLM and degrading the overall capability. To ease this challenge, we propose PROD for precise source code unlearning. PROD surgically zeroes out the prediction probability of the prohibited tokens, and renormalizes the remaining distribution so that the generated code stays correct. By excising only the targeted snippets, PROD achieves precise forgetting without much degradation of the LLM's overall capability. To facilitate in-depth evaluation against PROD, we establish an unlearning benchmark consisting of three downstream tasks (ie., unlearning of copyrighted code, insecure code, and deprecated APIs), and introduce Pareto Dominance Ratio (PDR) metric, which indicates both the forget quality and the LLM utility. Our comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that PROD achieves superior overall performance between forget quality and model utility compared to existing unlearning approaches across three downstream tasks, while consistently exhibiting improvements when applied to LLMs of varying series. PROD also exhibits superior robustness against adversarial attacks without generating or exposing the data to be forgotten. These results underscore that our approach not only successfully extends the application boundary of unlearning techniques to source code, but also holds significant implications for advancing reliable code generation.</p></details> | Accepted to AAAI'26 |
| **[Robust Nonlinear Transform Coding: A Framework for Generalizable Joint Source-Channel Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18884v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes robust nonlinear transform coding (Robust-NTC), a generalizable digital joint source-channel coding (JSCC) framework that couples variational latent modeling with channel adaptive transmission. Unlike learning-based JSCC methods that implicitly absorb channel variations, Robust-NTC explicitly models element-wise latent distributions via a variational objective with a Gaussian proxy for quantization and channel noise, allowing encoder-decoder to capture latent uncertainty without channel-specific training. Using the learned statistics, Robust-NTC also facilitates rate-distortion optimization to adaptively select element-wise quantizers and bit depths according to online channel condition. To support practical deployment, Robust-NTC is integrated into an orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) system, where a unified resource allocation framework jointly optimizes latent quantization, bit allocation, modulation order, and power allocation to minimize transmission latency while guaranteeing learned distortion targets. Simulation results demonstrate that for practical OFDM systems, Robust-NTC achieves superior rate-distortion efficiency and stable reconstruction fidelity compared to digital JSCC baselines across wide-ranging SNR conditions.</p></details> |  |
| **[One-weight codes in the sum-rank metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.04262v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One-weight codes, in which all nonzero codewords share the same weight, form a highly structured class of linear codes with deep connections to finite geometry. While their classification is well understood in the Hamming and rank metrics - being equivalent to (direct sums of) simplex codes - the sum-rank metric presents a far more intricate landscape. In this work, we explore the geometry of one-weight sum-rank metric codes, focusing on three distinct classes. First, we introduce and classify \emph{constant rank-list} sum-rank codes, where each nonzero codeword has the same tuple of ranks, extending results from the rank-metric setting. Next, we investigate the more general \emph{constant rank-profile} codes, where, up to reordering, each nonzero codeword has the same tuple of ranks. Although a complete classification remains elusive, we present the first examples and partial structural results for this class. Finally, we consider one-weight codes that are also MSRD (Maximum Sum-Rank Distance) codes. For dimension two, constructions arise from partitions of scattered linear sets on projective lines. For dimension three, we connect their existence to that of special $2$-fold blocking sets in the projective plane, leading to new bounds and nonexistence results over certain fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[VecIntrinBench: Benchmarking Cross-Architecture Intrinsic Code Migration for RISC-V Vector](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18867v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Intrinsic functions are specialized functions provided by the compiler that efficiently operate on architecture-specific hardware, allowing programmers to write optimized code in a high-level language that fully exploits hardware features. Using intrinsics to vectorize core code blocks is a standard optimization method in high-performance libraries, often requiring specific vector optimization implementations for multiple mainstream architectures. The promising RISC-V software ecosystem has a significant demand for algorithm library migration and adaptation. Translating existing intrinsic functions to RISC-V Vector (RVV) intrinsic functions across architectures is currently a mainstream approach. Rule-based intrinsic mapping methods and LLM-based code generation can help developers address the code migration challenge. However, existing intrinsic code benchmarks focus on mainstream SIMD intrinsics and lack support for the emerging RISC-V architecture. There is currently no benchmark that comprehensively evaluates the intrinsic migration capabilities for the RVV extension. To fill this gap, we propose VecIntrinBench, the first intrinsic benchmark encompassing RVV extensions. It includes 50 function-level tasks from open source repositories, implemented as scalars, RVV intrinsics, Arm Neon intrinsics, and x86 intrinsics, along with comprehensive functional and performance test cases. We systematically evaluated various code migration approaches on VecIntrinBench, yielding a series of insightful findings. The results demonstrate that advanced Large Language Models (LLMs) achieve a similar effect as rule-based mapping approaches for RISC-V code migration, while also delivering superior performance. We further analyze the reasons and identify future directions for LLM development in the code migration field. The VecIntrinBench is open-sourced to benefit the broader community and developers.</p></details> | 5 pages, 7 figures |

Despite progress in deep learning, genetic programming, and, more recently, large language model (LLM)--based factor generation, existing approaches still explore only a narrow region of the vast alpha search space. Neural models tend to produce opaque and fragile patterns, while symbolic or formula-based methods often yield redundant or economically ungrounded expressions that generalize poorly. Although different in form, these paradigms share a key limitation: none can conduct broad, structured, and human-like exploration that balances logical consistency with creative leaps. To address this gap, we introduce the Cognitive Alpha Mining Framework (CogAlpha), which combines code-level alpha representation with LLM-driven reasoning and evolutionary search. Treating LLMs as adaptive cognitive agents, our framework iteratively refines, mutates, and recombines alpha candidates through multi-stage prompts and financial feedback. This synergistic design enables deeper thinking, richer structural diversity, and economically interpretable alpha discovery, while greatly expanding the effective search space. Experiments on A-share equities demonstrate that CogAlpha consistently discovers alphas with superior predictive accuracy, robustness, and generalization over existing methods. Our results highlight the promise of aligning evolutionary optimization with LLM-based reasoning for automated and explainable alpha discovery. All source code will be released.</p></details> |  |

Yet many of these suggestions are ignored, resulting in wasted computation, increased latency, and unnecessary interruptions. We introduce a lightweight pre-filtering model that predicts the likelihood of suggestion acceptance before invoking the LLM, using only real-time developer telemetry such as typing speed, file navigation, and editing activity. Deployed in a production-grade Visual Studio Code plugin over four months of naturalistic use, our approach nearly doubled acceptance rates (18.4% -> 34.2%) while suppressing 35% of low-value LLM calls. These findings demonstrate that behavioral signals alone can meaningfully improve both user experience and system efficiency in LLM-assisted programming, highlighting the value of timing-aware, privacy-preserving adaptation mechanisms. The filter operates solely on pre-invocation editor telemetry and never inspects code or prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

Yet, deciding when to present these suggestions remains underexplored, often leading to interruptions or wasted inference calls. We propose an adaptive timing mechanism that dynamically adjusts the delay before offering a suggestion based on real-time developer feedback. Our suggested method combines a logistic transform of recent acceptance rates with a bounded delay range, anchored by a high-level binary prediction of the developer's cognitive state. In a two-month deployment with professional developers, our system improved suggestion acceptance from 4.9% with no delay to 15.4% with static delays, and to 18.6% with adaptive timing-while reducing blind rejections (rejections without being read) from 8.3% to 0.36%. Together, these improvements increase acceptance and substantially reduce wasted inference calls by 75%, making LLM-based code assistants more efficient and cost-effective in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

The limited resource for low-resource languages remains a crucial challenge. Code-switching (CS), a phenomenon where multilingual speakers alternate between languages in a discourse, can convey subtle cultural and linguistic nuances that can be otherwise lost in translation and elicits language-specific knowledge in human communications. In light of this, we investigate whether code-switching can activate, or identify and leverage knowledge for reasoning when LLMs solve low-resource language tasks. To facilitate the research, we first present EnKoQA, a synthetic English-Korean CS question-answering dataset. We provide comprehensive analysis on a variety of multilingual LLMs by subdividing activation process into knowledge identification and knowledge leveraging. Our results demonstrate that compared to English text, CS can faithfully activate knowledge inside LLMs especially on language-specific domains, suggesting the potential of code-switching on low-resource language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

These errors are hard for LLMs to spot and can have large behavioural effects; yet when asked to summarise code, LLMs can frequently surface high-level intent and sometimes overlook this low-level noise. Motivated by this, we propose summary-mediated repair, a prompt-only pipeline for program repair that leverages natural-language code summarisation as an explicit intermediate step, extending previous work that has already shown code summarisation to be a useful intermediary for downstream tasks. We evaluate our method across eight production-grade LLMs on two function level benchmarks (HumanEvalPack and MBPP), comparing several summary styles against a direct repair baseline. Error-aware diagnostic summaries consistently yield the largest gains - repairing up to 65% of unseen errors, on average of 5% more than the baseline - though overall improvements are modest and LLM-dependent. Our results position summaries as a cheap, human-interpretable diagnostic artefact that can be integrated into program-repair pipelines rather than a stand-alone fix-all.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[On Construction of Linear (Euclidean) Hull Codes over Finite Extensions Binary Fields](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18779v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hull of a linear code is defined as the intersection of the code and its dual. This concept was initially introduced to classify finite projective planes. The hull plays a crucial role in determining the complexity of algorithms used to check the permutation equivalence of two linear codes and compute a linear code's automorphism group. Research has shown that these algorithms are very effective when the hull size is small. Linear complementary dual (LCD) codes have the smallest hulls, while codes with a one-dimensional hull have the second smallest. A recent notable paper that directs our investigation is authored by H. Chen, titled ``On the Hull-Variation Problem of Equivalent Linear Codes", published in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory, volume 69, issue 5, in 2023. In this paper, we first explore the one-dimensional hull of a linear code over finite fields. Additionally, we demonstrate that any LCD code over an extended binary field \( \FF_q \) (where \( q > 3 \)) with a minimum distance of at least $2$ is equivalent to the one-dimensional hull of a linear code under a specific weak condition. Furthermore, we provide a construction for creating hulls with \( \ell + 1 \)-dimensionality from an \( \ell \)-dimensional hull of a linear code, again under a weak condition. This corresponds to a particularly challenging direction, as creating \( \ell \)-dimensional hulls from \( \ell + 1 \)-dimensional hulls. Finally, we derive several constructions for the \( \ell \)-dimensional hulls of linear codes as a consequence of our results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural B-Frame Coding: Tackling Domain Shift Issues with Lightweight Online Motion Resolution Adaptation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18724v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learned B-frame codecs with hierarchical temporal prediction often encounter the domain-shift issue due to mismatches between the Group-of-Pictures (GOP) sizes for training and testing, leading to inaccurate motion estimates, particularly for large motion. A common solution is to turn large motion into small motion by downsampling video frames during motion estimation. However, determining the optimal downsampling factor typically requires costly rate-distortion optimization. This work introduces lightweight classifiers to predict downsampling factors. These classifiers leverage simple state signals from current and reference frames to balance rate-distortion performance with computational cost. Three variants are proposed: (1) a binary classifier (Bi-Class) trained with Focal Loss to choose between high and low resolutions, (2) a multi-class classifier (Mu-Class) trained with novel soft labels based on rate-distortion costs, and (3) a co-class approach (Co-Class) that combines the predictive capability of the multi-class classifier with the selective search of the binary classifier. All classifier methods can work seamlessly with existing B-frame codecs without requiring codec retraining. Experimental results show that they achieve coding performance comparable to exhaustive search methods while significantly reducing computational complexity. The code is available at: https://github.com/NYCU-MAPL/Fast-OMRA.git.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TCAS-II: Express Briefs</p></details> |

| **[Evolving Triple Knowledge-Augmented LLMs for Code Translation in Repository Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18305v3)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have behaved well in function-level code translation without repository-level context. However, the performance of LLMs in repository-level context code translation remains suboptimal due to complex dependencies and context, hindering their adoption in industrial settings. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based code translation technique K-Trans, which leverages triple knowledge augmentation to enhance LLM's translation quality under repository context in real-world software development. First, K-Trans constructs a evolving translation knowledge base by extracting relevant information from target-language codebases, the repository being translated, and prior translation results. Second, for each function to be translated, K-Trans retrieves relevant triple knowledge, including target-language code samples, dependency usage examples, and successful translation function pairs, serving as references to enhance LLM for translation. Third, K-Trans constructs a knowledge-augmented translation prompt using the retrieved triple knowledge and employs LLMs to generate the translated code while preserving repository context. It further leverages LLMs for self-debugging, enhancing translation correctness. Lastly, K-Trans continuously evolves the translation knowledge base. The experiments show that K-Trans substantially outperforms the baseline adapted from previous work by 19.4%/40.2% relative improvement in pass@1 and 0.138 in CodeBLEU. It is important to note that the results also demonstrate that each knowledge significantly contributes to K-Trans's effectiveness in handling repository-level context code translation, with dependency usage examples making the most notable contribution. Moreover, as the self-evolution process progresses, the knowledge base continuously enhances the LLM's performance across various aspects of the repository-level code translation.</p></details> |  |

While the field has evolved dramatically from rule-based systems to Transformer-based architectures, achieving performance improvements from single-digit to over 95\% success rates on benchmarks like HumanEval. In this work, we provide a comprehensive synthesis and practical guide (a series of analytic and probing experiments) about code LLMs, systematically examining the complete model life cycle from data curation to post-training through advanced prompting paradigms, code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and autonomous coding agents. We analyze the code capability of the general LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA) and code-specialized LLMs (StarCoder, Code LLaMA, DeepSeek-Coder, and QwenCoder), critically examining the techniques, design decisions, and trade-offs. Further, we articulate the research-practice gap between academic research (e.g., benchmarks and tasks) and real-world deployment (e.g., software-related code tasks), including code correctness, security, contextual awareness of large codebases, and integration with development workflows, and map promising research directions to practical needs. Last, we conduct a series of experiments to provide a comprehensive analysis of code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, covering scaling law, framework selection, hyperparameter sensitivity, model architectures, and dataset comparisons.</p></details> |  |
| **[LockForge: Automating Paper-to-Code for Logic Locking with Multi-Agent Reasoning LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18531v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite rapid progress in logic locking (LL), reproducibility remains a challenge as codes are rarely made public. We present LockForge, a first-of-its-kind, multi-agent large language model (LLM) framework that turns LL descriptions in papers into executable and tested code. LockForge provides a carefully crafted pipeline realizing forethought, implementation, iterative refinement, and a multi-stage validation, all to systematically bridge the gap between prose and practice for complex LL schemes. For validation, we devise (i) an LLM-as-Judge stage with a scoring system considering behavioral checks, conceptual mechanisms, structural elements, and reproducibility on benchmarks, and (ii) an independent LLM-as-Examiner stage for ground-truth assessment. We apply LockForge to 10 seminal LL schemes, many of which lack reference implementations. Our evaluation on multiple SOTA LLMs, including ablation studies, reveals the significant complexity of the task. We show that an advanced reasoning model and a sophisticated, multi-stage framework like LockForge are required. We release all implementations and benchmarks, providing a reproducible and fair foundation for evaluation of further LL research.</p></details> |  |

Here, we present a framework to evaluate robustness of systems using COBOL code as input; our application is translation between COBOL and Java programming languages, but the approach extends to other tasks such as code generation or explanation. Targeting robustness of systems with COBOL as input is essential yet challenging. Many business-critical applications are written in COBOL, yet these are typically proprietary legacy applications and their code is unavailable to LLMs for training. We develop a library of COBOL paragraph and full-program perturbation methods, and create variant-expanded versions of a benchmark dataset of examples for a specific task. The robustness of the LLM-based system is evaluated by measuring changes in values of individual and aggregate metrics calculated on the system's outputs. Finally, we present a series of dynamic table and chart visualization dashboards that assist in debugging the system's outputs, and monitoring and understanding root causes of the system's sensitivity to input variation. These tools can be further used to improve the system by, for instance, indicating variations that should be handled by pre-processing steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages (8 main, 8 appendix).

| **[SFusion: Energy and Coding Fusion for Ultra-Robust Low-SNR LoRa Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18484v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LoRa has become a cornerstone for city-wide IoT applications due to its long-range, low-power communication. It achieves extended transmission by spreading symbols over multiple samples, with redundancy controlled by the Spreading Factor (SF), and further error resilience provided by Forward Error Correction (FEC). However, practical limits on SF and the separation between signal-level demodulation and coding-level error correction in conventional LoRa PHY leave it vulnerable under extremely weak signals - common in city-scale deployments. To address this, we present SFusion, a software-based coding framework that jointly leverages signal-level aggregation and coding-level redundancy to enhance LoRa's robustness. When signals fall below the decodable threshold, SFusion encodes a quasi-SF(k +m) symbol using 2^m SFk symbols to boost processing gain through energy accumulation. Once partial decoding becomes feasible with energy aggregation, an opportunistic decoding strategy directly combines IQ signals across symbols to recover errors. Extensive evaluations show that SFusion achieves up to 15dB gain over SF12 and up to 13dB improvement over state-of-the-art solutions.</p></details> |  |

While these systems democratize software creation through natural language requirements, they introduce significant security risks that remain largely unexplored. We identify two risky scenarios: Malicious User with Benign Agents (MU-BA) and Benign User with Malicious Agents (BU-MA). We introduce the Implicit Malicious Behavior Injection Attack (IMBIA), demonstrating how multi-agent systems can be manipulated to generate software with concealed malicious capabilities beneath seemingly benign applications, and propose Adv-IMBIA as a defense mechanism. Evaluations across ChatDev, MetaGPT, and AgentVerse frameworks reveal varying vulnerability patterns, with IMBIA achieving attack success rates of 93%, 45%, and 71% in MU-BA scenarios, and 71%, 84%, and 45% in BU-MA scenarios. Our defense mechanism reduced attack success rates significantly, particularly in the MU-BA scenario. Further analysis reveals that compromised agents in the coding and testing phases pose significantly greater security risks, while also identifying critical agents that require protection against malicious user exploitation. Our findings highlight the urgent need for robust security measures in multi-agent software development systems and provide practical guidelines for implementing targeted, resource-efficient defensive strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by AAAI 2026 Alignment Track</p></details> |
| **[Function-Correcting Codes With Data Protection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18420v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function-correcting codes (FCCs) are designed to provide error protection for the value of a function computed on the data. Existing work typically focuses solely on protecting the function value and not the underlying data. In this work, we propose a general framework that offers protection for both the data and the function values. Since protecting the data inherently contributes to protecting the function value, we focus on scenarios where the function value requires stronger protection than the data itself. We first introduce a more general approach and a framework for function-correcting codes that incorporates data protection along with protection of function values. A two-step construction procedure for such codes is proposed, and bounds on the optimal redundancy of general FCCs with data protection are reported. Using these results, we exhibit examples that show that data protection can be added to existing FCCs without increasing redundancy. Using our two-step construction procedure, we present explicit constructions of FCCs with data protection for specific families of functions, such as locally bounded functions and the Hamming weight function. We associate a graph called minimum-distance graph to a code and use it to show that perfect codes and maximum distance separable (MDS) codes cannot provide additional protection to function values over and above the amount of protection for data for any function. Then we focus on linear FCCs and provide some results for linear functions, leveraging their inherent structural properties. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first instance of FCCs with a linear structure. Finally, we generalize the Plotkin and Hamming bounds well known in classical error-correcting coding theory to FCCs with data protection.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReCode: Updating Code API Knowledge with Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.20495v5)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable code generation capabilities but falter when adapting to frequent updates in external library APIs. This critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically, we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities. We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned model and the reasoning model with the same architecture.

| **[AP2O-Coder: Human-Inspired Progressive Optimization to Fix LLM Code Errors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02393v3)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs' code generation capabilities have yielded substantial improvements in the effectiveness of programming tasks. However, LLM-generated code still suffers from compilation and runtime errors. Existing offline preference optimization methods primarily focus on enhancing LLMs' coding abilities using pass/fail signals in the preference data, overlooking the deep-level error types in the failed codes. To address this, we propose Adaptively Progressive Preference Optimization (AP2O) for coding (i.e., AP2O-Coder), a method that guides LLMs adaptively and methodically to reduce code errors for code generation. Specifically, we construct an error notebook from failed codes and progressively optimize the LLM to correct errors type by type. Furthermore, we adaptively replay error types to tailor to the LLM's changing weaknesses throughout the training process. Through extensive experiments on both code and general LLMs (Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek series) with parameters ranging from 0.5B to 34B, our AP2O-Coder improves code generation performance by up to 3% in pass@k while using less preference data.

Automated question answering systems over such codes enable quick and accurate access to specific regulatory clauses, improving efficiency and reducing errors. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems are essential for this task as they combine the precision of information retrieval with the generative capabilities of language models. However, tabular data are challenging to extract as they often involve complex layouts, merged cells, multi-row headers, and embedded semantic relationships that are not easily captured by traditional natural language processing techniques and Vision Language Models (VLMs). This paper explores and compares two methods for extracting information from tabular data in building codes using several pre-trained VLMs. First, a direct input method is used, where the image of the page is input directly into the VLMs, which are then tasked with answering questions based on the image. Second, an indirect input method is introduced, which involves converting an image of a page containing tables into the LaTeX code and then answering inquires based on the LaTeX-based input. The experiments find that the direct input method generally resulted in higher accuracy than the indirect input method. To further improve the performance, we fine-tuned each VLM using Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) on a domain-specific tabular dataset. The fine-tuned models exhibited substantial improvements, with Qwen2.5-VL-3B-Instruct achieving relative accuracy gains exceeding 100%. Our results highlight the potential of parameter-efficient fine-tuning methods to adapt powerful VLMs for understanding complex structured data in specialized fields, such as building code interpretation and regulatory compliance.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Hamming Weight Functions of Linear Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18250v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently known secondary construction techniques for linear codes mainly include puncturing, shortening, and extending. In this paper, we propose a novel method for the secondary construction of linear codes based on their weight functions. Specifically, we develop a general framework that constructs new linear codes from the set of codewords in a given code having a fixed Hamming weight. We analyze the dimension, number of weights, and weight distribution of the constructed codes, and establish connections with the extendability of the original codes as well as the partial weight distribution of the derived codes. As a new tool, this framework enables us to establish an upper bound on the minimum weight of two-weight codes and to characterize all two-weight codes attaining this bound. Moreover, several divisibility properties concerning the parameters of two-weight codes are derived. The proposed method not only generates new families of linear codes but also provides a powerful approach for exploring the intrinsic combinatorial and geometric structures of existing codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Assisted Coding with Metamorphic Specification Mutation Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18249v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Metamorphic Relations (MRs) serve as a foundational mechanism for generating semantically equivalent mutations. Software engineering has advanced significantly in recent years with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, the reliability of LLMs in software engineering is often compromised by ambiguities and inconsistencies due to improper user specification. To address this challenge, we present CodeMetaAgent (CMA), a metamorphic relation-driven LLM agent that systematically refines task specifications and generates semantically constrained test cases. Our proposed framework uses MRs with LLMs to improve generation consistency and reduce variability caused by specifications, unlike the traditional use of MRs as post validations. Our framework has been evaluated on the HumanEval-Pro, MBPP-Pro, and SWE-Bench_Lite datasets using the GPT-4o, Mistral Large, GPT-OSS, and Qwen3-Coder models. It improved code generation accuracy by up to 17% and achieved code coverage gains of up to 99.81%. These results show that metamorphic relations can be a simple but effective guide in assisting LLM-based software development.</p></details> |  |

However, existing code generation benchmarks primarily assess the functional correctness of code generated by LLMs in single-turn interactions. They offer limited insight into LLMs' abilities to generate code that strictly follows users' instructions in multi-turn interaction scenarios. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF-Bench, a benchmark for evaluating the instruction-following capabilities of LLMs in interactive code generation. Specifically, CodeIF-Bench incorporates nine types of verifiable instructions aligned with the real-world software development requirements, which can be independently and objectively validated through specified test cases, facilitating the evaluation of instruction-following capability in multi-turn interactions. In both Static Conversation and Dynamic Conversation settings, we evaluate the performance of 6 state-of-the-art LLMs and summarize the important factors, additional repository context and gradually increasing interaction history influencing the instruction-following ability of LLMs in multi-turn interactions. Furthermore, we identify the potential direction for improvement: context management.

| **[From Code to Correctness: Closing the Last Mile of Code Generation with Hierarchical Debugging](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.01215v4)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models have made significant strides in code generation, the pass rate of the generated code is bottlenecked on subtle errors, often requiring human intervention to pass tests, especially for complex problems. Existing LLM-based debugging systems treat generated programs as monolithic units, failing to address bugs at multiple levels of granularity, from low-level syntax errors to high-level algorithmic flaws. In this paper, we introduce Multi-Granularity Debugger (MGDebugger), a hierarchical code debugger by isolating, identifying, and resolving bugs at various levels of granularity. MGDebugger decomposes problematic code into a hierarchical tree structure of subfunctions, with each level representing a particular granularity of error. During debugging, it analyzes each subfunction and iteratively resolves bugs in a bottom-up manner. To effectively test each subfunction, we propose an LLM-simulated Python executor, which traces code execution and tracks important variable states to pinpoint errors accurately. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MGDebugger outperforms existing debugging systems, achieving an 18.9% improvement in accuracy over seed generations in HumanEval and a 97.6% repair success rate in HumanEvalFix. Furthermore, MGDebugger effectively fixes bugs across different categories and difficulty levels, demonstrating its robustness and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSE 2026.

| **[BOOP: Write Right Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22085v2)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novice programmers frequently adopt a syntax-specific and test-case-driven approach, writing code first and adjusting until programs compile and test cases pass, rather than developing correct solutions through systematic reasoning. AI coding tools exacerbate this challenge by providing syntactically correct but conceptually flawed solutions. In this paper, we address the question of developing correctness-first methodologies to enhance computational thinking in introductory programming education. To this end, we introduce BOOP (Blueprint, Operations, OCaml, Proof), a structured framework requiring four mandatory phases: formal specification, language-agnostic algorithm development, implementation, and correctness proof. This shifts focus from making the code to understanding the code is correct. BOOP was implemented at Ashoka University using a VS Code extension and preprocessor that enforces constraints. Initial evaluation shows improved algorithmic reasoning and reduced trial-and-error debugging. Students reported better edge case understanding and problem decomposition, though some initially found the format verbose. Instructors observed stronger foundational skills compared to traditional approaches, suggesting that structured correctness-first approaches may significantly improve students' computational thinking abilities.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches (e.g., SafeCoder) to improve secure code generation are limited by small, imbalanced instruction-tuning datasets. In this work, we present Secure-Instruct, a novel pipeline that automatically synthesizes high-quality vulnerable and secure code examples and instruction-tunes LLMs to align task description and secure code generation abilities. We evaluate Secure-Instruct on four representative LLMs using two security-related benchmarks: our own CWEBench and the existing CWEval. CWEBench comprises 93 scenarios on 44 CWEs, all without overlap with Secure-Instruct's synthetic instruction-tuning dataset, while CWEval covers 31 CWEs with 119 manually verified security-critical tasks. We find that Secure-Instruct improves both security and functional correctness in code generation. On CWEBench, Secure-Instruct substantially improves secure code generation, giving a 28.5% increase on average in secure ratio over the pre-trained models and outperforms SafeCoder by 12.6%. On CWEval, Secure-Instruct achieves an increase of 157.3% for CodeLlama-7B and 46.4% for Mistral-7B in Func-Sec@1 over pretrained models, and significantly outperforms SafeCoder.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reducing Hallucinations in LLM-Generated Code via Semantic Triangulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12288v2)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When generating code from natural language prompts, an LLM samples programs from a probability distribution, many of which might be incorrect. Sample consensus techniques - such as majority voting or validation against generated tests or specifications - aim to identify a correct program in the sample or abstain if none is valid. However, existing methods often fail to select a correct solution when its sampling probability is low, or when the problem permits multiple valid but non-equivalent solutions. Additionally, they often fail to abstain when no correct solution is present in the sample. To overcome these limitations, we introduce semantic triangulation, which transforms a programming problem in a way that non-trivially alters its semantics while preserving an exact, verifiable mapping between solutions before and after transformation. We theoretically establish that verifying consistency across such problem transformations increases confidence that generated programs reflect accurate generalization rather than spurious statistical correlations, enabling more reliable sample consensus and abstention. On the LiveCodeBench and CodeElo benchmarks, using GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 models, semantic triangulation increases reliability of generated code by 21% compared to the method that selects only high-confidence solutions with the probability threshold 0.5, while being able to pinpoint correct solutions at sampling probabilities as low as 0.14. Apart from that, it is also the only approach to consistently form true consensus on tasks with multiple valid but non-equivalent solutions.</p></details> |  |
| **[INT-DTT+: Low-Complexity Data-Dependent Transforms for Video Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17867v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Discrete trigonometric transforms (DTTs), such as the DCT-2 and the DST-7, are widely used in video codecs for their balance between coding performance and computational efficiency. In contrast, data-dependent transforms, such as the Karhunen-Loève transform (KLT) and graph-based separable transforms (GBSTs), offer better energy compaction but lack symmetries that can be exploited to reduce computational complexity. This paper bridges this gap by introducing a general framework to design low-complexity data-dependent transforms. Our approach builds on DTT+, a family of GBSTs derived from rank-one updates of the DTT graphs, which can adapt to signal statistics while retaining a structure amenable to fast computation. We first propose a graph learning algorithm for DTT+ that estimates the rank-one updates for rows and column graphs jointly, capturing the statistical properties of the overall block. Then, we exploit the progressive structure of DTT+ to decompose the kernel into a base DTT and a structured Cauchy matrix. By leveraging low-complexity integer DTTs and sparsifying the Cauchy matrix, we construct an integer approximation to DTT+, termed INT-DTT+. This approximation significantly reduces both computational and memory complexities with respect to the separable KLT with minimal performance loss. We validate our approach in the context of mode-dependent transforms for the VVC standard, following a rate-distortion optimized transform (RDOT) design approach. Integrated into the explicit multiple transform selection (MTS) framework of VVC in a rate-distortion optimization setup, INT-DTT+ achieves more than 3% BD-rate savings over the VVC MTS baseline, with complexity comparable to the integer DCT-2 once the base DTT coefficients are available.</p></details> |  |

| **[The Coding Limits of Robust Watermarking for Generative Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10577v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We ask a basic question about cryptographic watermarking for generative models: to what extent can a watermark remain reliable when an adversary is allowed to corrupt the encoded signal? To study this question, we introduce a minimal coding abstraction that we call a zero-bit tamper-detection code. This is a secret-key procedure that samples a pseudorandom codeword and, given a candidate word, decides whether it should be treated as unmarked content or as the result of tampering with a valid codeword. It captures the two core requirements of robust watermarking: soundness and tamper detection. Within this abstraction we prove a sharp unconditional limit on robustness to independent symbol corruption. For an alphabet of size $q$, there is a critical corruption rate of $1 - 1/q$ such that no scheme with soundness, even relaxed to allow a fixed constant false positive probability on random content, can reliably detect tampering once an adversary can change more than this fraction of symbols. In particular, in the binary case no cryptographic watermark can remain robust if more than half of the encoded bits are modified. We also show that this threshold is tight by giving simple information-theoretic constructions that achieve soundness and tamper detection for all strictly smaller corruption rates. We then test experimentally whether this limit appears in practice by looking at the recent watermarking for images of Gunn, Zhao, and Song (ICLR 2025). We show that a simple crop and resize operation reliably flipped about half of the latent signs and consistently prevented belief-propagation decoding from recovering the codeword, erasing the watermark while leaving the image visually intact.</p></details> |  |
| **[CATCODER: Repository-Level Code Generation with Relevant Code and Type Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03283v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation tasks. However, repository-level code generation presents unique challenges, particularly due to the need to utilize information spread across multiple files within a repository. Specifically, successful generation depends on a solid grasp of both general, context-agnostic knowledge and specific, context-dependent knowledge. While LLMs are widely used for the context-agnostic aspect, existing retrieval-based approaches sometimes fall short as they are limited in obtaining a broader and deeper repository context. In this paper, we present CatCoder, a novel code generation framework designed for statically typed programming languages. CatCoder enhances repository-level code generation by integrating relevant code and type context. Specifically, it leverages static analyzers to extract type dependencies and merges this information with retrieved code to create comprehensive prompts for LLMs. To evaluate the effectiveness of CatCoder, we adapt and construct benchmarks that include 199 Java tasks and 90 Rust tasks. The results show that CatCoder outperforms the RepoCoder baseline by up to 14.44% and 17.35%, in terms of compile@k and pass@k scores. In addition, the generalizability of CatCoder is assessed using various LLMs, including both code-specialized models and general-purpose models. Our findings indicate consistent performance improvements across all models, which underlines the practicality of CatCoder. Furthermore, we evaluate the time consumption of CatCoder in a large open source repository, and the results demonstrate the scalability of CatCoder.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised and extended version; To be published in ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology</p></details> |

A timely and motivating engineering application is how autonomous vehicles interpret ambiguous right-of-way such as unsignalized pedestrian crossings. To address this challenge, this study explores the feasibility of decoding preparatory neural activity from wearable electroencephalography (EEG) to predict human motion intention before it is behaviorally expressed. Drawing inspiration from biological predictive coding mechanisms between the sensorimotor cortex and insula-frontoparietal network, we implement this principle in a Temporal Convolutional Network-Transformer architecture to decode fast-evolving EEG signals underlying perception-action transitions. In experiments involving twelve participants simulating road-crossing decisions under varying traffic volume, marked crosswalks, and traffic signals, neurophysiological analyses reveal hemispheric asymmetries in functional specialization and identify high-beta oscillations (16-25 Hz) in the right fronto-central region (F4) as robust neural markers of motor readiness and decision commitment. Using sliding-window feature extraction, we benchmarked sixteen classification models across traditional, recurrent, and convolutional deep learning architectures, and found that our approach achieved the highest Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 0.727 with an approximate 1-second look-ahead. This work demonstrates how biologically grounded temporal architectures can enhance anticipatory intelligence in autonomous systems and represents the first step toward proactive and adaptive human-robot interaction in the built environment.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Platonic Representations for Poverty Mapping: Unified Vision-Language Codes or Agent-Induced Novelty?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01109v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate whether socio-economic indicators like household wealth leave recoverable imprints in satellite imagery (capturing physical features) and Internet-sourced text (reflecting historical/economic narratives). Using Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from African neighborhoods, we pair Landsat images with LLM-generated textual descriptions conditioned on location/year and text retrieved by an AI search agent from web sources. We develop a multimodal framework predicting household wealth (International Wealth Index) through five pipelines: (i) vision model on satellite images, (ii) LLM using only location/year, (iii) AI agent searching/synthesizing web text, (iv) joint image-text encoder, (v) ensemble of all signals. Our framework yields three contributions. First, fusing vision and agent/LLM text outperforms vision-only baselines in wealth prediction (e.g., R-squared of 0.77 vs. 0.63 on out-of-sample splits), with LLM-internal knowledge proving more effective than agent-retrieved text, improving robustness to out-of-country and out-of-time generalization. Second, we find partial representational convergence: fused embeddings from vision/language modalities correlate moderately (median cosine similarity of 0.60 after alignment), suggesting a shared latent code of material well-being while retaining complementary details, consistent with the Platonic Representation Hypothesis. Although LLM-only text outperforms agent-retrieved data, challenging our Agent-Induced Novelty Hypothesis, modest gains from combining agent data in some splits weakly support the notion that agent-gathered information introduces unique representational structures not fully captured by static LLM knowledge. Third, we release a large-scale multimodal dataset comprising more than 60,000 DHS clusters linked to satellite images, LLM-generated descriptions, and agent-retrieved texts.</p></details> | 7 figures |
| **[Beyond Code Similarity: Benchmarking the Plausibility, Efficiency, and Complexity of LLM-Generated Smart Contracts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16224v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart Contracts are critical components of blockchain ecosystems, with Solidity as the dominant programming language. While LLMs excel at general-purpose code generation, the unique constraints of Smart Contracts, such as gas consumption, security, and determinism, raise open questions about the reliability of LLM-generated Solidity code. Existing studies lack a comprehensive evaluation of these critical functional and non-functional properties. We benchmark four state-of-the-art models under zero-shot and retrieval-augmented generation settings across 500 real-world functions. Our multi-faceted assessment employs code similarity metrics, semantic embeddings, automated test execution, gas profiling, and cognitive and cyclomatic complexity analysis. Results show that while LLMs produce code with high semantic similarity to real contracts, their functional correctness is low: only 20% to 26% of zero-shot generations behave identically to ground-truth implementations under testing. The generated code is consistently simpler, with significantly lower complexity and gas consumption, often due to omitted validation logic. Retrieval-Augmented Generation markedly improves performance, boosting functional correctness by up to 45% and yielding more concise and efficient code. Our findings reveal a significant gap between semantic similarity and functional plausibility in LLM-generated Smart Contracts. We conclude that while RAG is a powerful enhancer, achieving robust, production-ready code generation remains a substantial challenge, necessitating careful expert validation.</p></details> | 20 pages |

We achieve this by establishing a correspondence between the star product and the evaluation of bilinear forms, which we use to provide a lower bound on the expected star product dimension. We show that asymptotically in both the field size q and the dimensions of the two codes, the expected dimension reaches its maximum. Lastly, we discuss some implications related to private information retrieval, secure distributed matrix multiplication, quantum error correction, and the potential for exploiting the results in cryptanalysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Gradient Coding: From Optimal Design to Privacy at Intermediate Nodes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18251v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gradient coding is a distributed computing technique for computing gradient vectors over large datasets by outsourcing partial computations to multiple workers, typically connected directly to the server. In this work, we investigate gradient coding in a hierarchical setting, where intermediate nodes sit between the server and workers. This structure reduces the communication load received at the server, which is a bottleneck in conventional gradient coding systems. In this paper, the intermediate nodes, referred to as \textit{relays}, process the data received from workers and send the results to the server for the final gradient computation. Our main contribution is deriving the optimal communication-computation trade-off by designing a linear coding scheme, also considering straggling and adversarial nodes among both relays and workers. We propose a coding scheme which achieves both the optimal relay-to-server communication load and the optimal worker-to-relay communication load. We further extend our setting to incorporate privacy by requiring that relays learn no information about the computed partial gradients from the messages they receive. This is achieved by introducing shared randomness among workers, allowing each worker to encode its partial gradients such that the randomness cannot be canceled out at the relay. Meanwhile, the server can successfully decode the global gradient by eliminating this randomness after receiving the computations of the non-straggling relays. Importantly, this privacy guarantee is achieved without increasing the overall communication load.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory.

They give the upper and lower bound of $m(k;q)$.

| **[Guessing Decoding of Short Blocklength Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12108v3)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Future beyond-5G and 6G systems demand ultra-reliable, low-latency communication with short blocklengths, motivating the development of universal decoding algorithms. Guessing decoding, which infers the noise or codeword candidate in order of decreasing (exact or approximate) likelihood, offers a universal framework applicable to short codes. In this paper, we present a unified treatment of two prominent recent families of guessing decoding: guessing random additive noise decoding (GRAND) and guessing codeword decoding (GCD). For each, we (i) present algorithmic implementations and ordering strategies; (ii) prove maximum-likelihood (ML) optimality under appropriate stopping criteria; (iii) derive saddle-point approximations for the average number of queries; and (iv) validate theoretical predictions with simulations. We further analyze the performance degradation due to limited search budgets relative to ML performance, compare key metrics (worst-case and average complexity, hardware considerations), and highlight how advances in one approach transfer naturally to the other. Our results clarify the operating regimes where GRAND and GCD demonstrate superior performance. This work provides both theoretical insights and practical guidelines for deploying universal guessing decoders in next-generation short-blocklength communications.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Causal Perspective on Measuring, Explaining and Mitigating Smells in LLM-Generated Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15817v2)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated their adoption in software engineering contexts. However, concerns persist about the structural quality of the code they produce. In particular, LLMs often replicate poor coding practices, introducing code smells (i.e., patterns that hinder readability, maintainability, or design integrity). Although prior research has examined the detection or repair of smells, we still lack a clear understanding of how and when these issues emerge in generated code. This paper addresses this gap by systematically measuring, explaining and mitigating smell propensity in LLM-generated code. We build on the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), a probabilistic metric that estimates the likelihood of generating particular smell types, and establish its robustness as a signal of structural quality. Using PSC as an instrument for causal analysis, we identify how generation strategy, model size, model architecture and prompt formulation shape the structural properties of generated code. Our findings show that prompt design and architectural choices play a decisive role in smell propensity and motivate practical mitigation strategies that reduce its occurrence. A user study further demonstrates that PSC helps developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality, providing evidence that smell propensity signals can support human judgement. Taken together, our work lays the groundwork for integrating quality-aware assessments into the evaluation and deployment of LLMs for code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Formal Verification of LLM-Generated Code from Natural Language Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.13290v2)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the past few years LLMs have emerged as a tool that can aid programmers by taking natural language descriptions and generating code based on it. However, the reliability of LLM code generation and current validation techniques for it are far from strong enough to be used for mission-critical or safety-critical applications. In this work we explore ways to offer formal guarantees of correctness to LLM generated code; such guarantees could improve the quality of general AI Code Assistants and support their use for critical applications. To address this challenge we propose to incorporate a Formal Query Language that can represent a user's intent in a formally defined but natural language-like manner that a user can confirm matches their intent. We then have a formal specification of the user intent which we can use to verify that LLM-generated code matches the user's intent. We implement these ideas in our system, Astrogator, for the Ansible programming language, widely used for system administration, including for critical systems. The system includes an intuitive formal query language, a calculus for representing the behavior of Ansible programs, and a symbolic interpreter and a unification algorithm which together are used for the verification. A key innovation in Astrogator is the use of a Knowledge Base to capture system-specific implementation dependencies that greatly reduce the need for system knowledge in expressing formal queries. On a benchmark suite of 21 code-generation tasks, our verifier is able to verify correct code in 83% of cases and identify incorrect code in 92%.</p></details> | 28 pages, 10 figures |

In this paper, we propose a construction of infinite families of quasi-cyclic codes which are self-orthogonal with respect to the Euclidean and Hermitian inner products. In particular, their dimension and a lower bound for their minimum distance are computed using their constituent codes defined over field extensions of $\mathbb{F}_q$. We also show that the lower bound for the minimum distance satisfies the square-root-like lower bound and also show how self-dual quasi-cyclic codes can arise from our construction. Using the CSS construction, we show the existence of quantum error-correcting codes with good parameters.</p></details> | 20 pages |

This work introduces MeshCone, a convex optimization framework for guided mesh refinement that leverages reference geometry to correct deformed or degraded meshes. We formulate the problem as a second-order cone program where vertex positions are optimized to align with target geometry while enforcing smoothness through convex edge-length regularization. MeshCone performs geometry-aware optimization that preserves fine details while correcting structural defects. We demonstrate robust performance across 56 diverse object categories from ShapeNet and ThreeDScans, achieving superior refinement quality compared to Laplacian smoothing and unoptimized baselines while maintaining sub-second inference times. MeshCone is particularly suited for applications where reference geometry is available, such as mesh-from-template workflows, scan-to-CAD alignment, and quality assurance in asset production pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prune4Web: DOM Tree Pruning Programming for Web Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21398v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web automation employs intelligent agents to execute high-level tasks by mimicking human interactions with web interfaces. Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Programming Without the Quantum Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16234v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a quantum programming paradigm where all data are familiar classical data, and the only non-classical element is a random number generator that can return results with negative probability. Currently, the vast majority of quantum programming languages instead work with quantum data types made up of qubits. The description of their behavior relies on heavy linear algebra and many interdependent concepts and intuitions from quantum physics, which takes dedicated study to understand. We demonstrate that the proposed view of quantum programming explains its central concepts and constraints in more accessible, computationally relevant terms. This is achieved by systematically reducing everything to the existence of that negative-probability random generator, avoiding mention of advanced physics as much as possible. This makes quantum programming more accessible to programmers without a deep background in physics or linear algebra. The bulk of this paper is written with such an audience in mind. As a working vehicle, we lay out a simple quantum programming language under this paradigm, showing that not only can it express all quantum programs, it also naturally captures the semantics of measurement without ever mentioning qubits or collapse. The language is proved to be implementable and universal.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures. Version accepted at APLAS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Convex Mixed-Integer Programming for Causal Additive Models with Optimization and Statistical Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21126v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of learning a directed acyclic graph from data generated according to an additive, non-linear structural equation model with Gaussian noise. We express each non-linear function through a basis expansion, and derive a maximum likelihood estimator with a group l0-regularization that penalizes the number of edges in the graph. The resulting estimator is formulated through a convex mixed-integer program, enabling the use of branch-and-bound methods to obtain a solution that is guaranteed to be accurate up to a pre-specified optimality gap. Our formulation can naturally encode background knowledge, such as the presence or absence of edges and partial order constraints among the variables. We establish consistency guarantees for our estimator in terms of graph recovery, even when the number of variables grows with the sample size. Additionally, by connecting the optimality guarantees with our statistical error bounds, we derive an early stopping criterion that allows terminating the branch-and-bound procedure while preserving consistency. Compared with existing approaches that either assume equal error variances, restrict to linear structural equation models, or rely on heuristic procedures, our method enjoys both optimization and statistical guarantees. Extensive simulations and real-data analysis show that the proposed method achieves markedly better graph recovery performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[BRIDGE: Building Representations In Domain Guided Program Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21104v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in code generation, yet struggle with program verification, especially in interactive proof frameworks such as Lean4. A central challenge is scalability: verified synthesis requires not just code, but also precise specifications and correctness proofs, and existing approaches rarely span all three domains. We present BRIDGE, the first systematic study of structured prompting for scalable verified program generation. BRIDGE decomposes verification into three interconnected domains: Code (executable implementations), Specifications (formal intent statements), and Proofs (constructive correctness arguments). Our key idea is to elicit distinct reasoning behaviors functional, specification-driven, and proof-oriented as intermediate representations that preserve semantic structure and connect these domains. Through systematic ablations, we show that this approach substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency beyond standard error feedback methods. For example, functional reasoning improves correctness of code in formal languages (Lean4) by nearly 1.5x (pass@5) over direct baselines. In inference-time compute, functional reasoning is also 2x more efficient, achieving higher pass rates with fewer generations and lower total sampling budgets. Similarly, we find that specification-driven prompting boosts Python coding pass rates by up to 17.5%. These findings suggest that structured domain alignment is a promising direction for advancing verified synthesis. BRIDGE establishes a foundation for training via expert iteration or RLVR, enabling models to internalize these reasoning strategies across code, specifications, and proofs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appro...</summary><p>Approx. 31 pages including appendices, 11 figures, 4 tables.

As part of the study, the existing adaptive program management tools are analyzed, the use of infrastructure systems modelling tools is justified for program architecture and WBS creation. Existing models and modelling methods are viewed, and machine learning and artificial neural networks are selected for the model. The main components of the model are defined, which include a set of decision-maker preferences, decision-making tasks, sets of input data, and applied software components of the model. To support decision-making, the adaptive model applies the method of system modeling and predicting the value of the objective function at a given system configuration. Prediction is done using machine learning methods based on a dataset consisting of historical data related to existing engineering systems. The work describes the components of the redistribution of varied model parameters, which modify the model dataset based on the selected object type, which allows adapting the decision-making process to the existing program implementation goals. The functional composition done in Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio is described. The neural network parameters and evaluation results are given. The application of the developed adaptive model is possible in the management of programs for the reconstruction of such engineering systems as systems of heat, gas, electricity supply, water supply, and drainage, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

By expressing a constrained optimisation as one of simulation from a Boltzmann distribution, we reformulate integer and linear programming as Monte Carlo optimisation problems. The key insight is that solving these optimisation problems requires the ability to simulate from truncated distributions, namely multivariate exponentials and Gaussians. Efficient simulation can be achieved using the algorithms of Kent and Davis. We demonstrate our methodology on portfolio optimisation and the classical farmer problem from stochastic programming. Finally, we conclude with directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

Inference is challenging, especially when exact rather than approximate results are required. Inspired by recent work on probability generating functions (PGFs), we propose encoding distributions on $\mathbb{N}^k$ as weighted automata over a commutative alphabet with $k$ symbols. Based on this, we map the semantics of various imperative programming statements to automata-theoretic constructions. For a rich class of programs, this results in an effective translation from prior to posterior distribution, both encoded as automata. We prove that our approach is sound with respect to a standard operational program semantics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hadamard-Pi: Equational Quantum Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06835v2)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing offers advantages over classical computation, yet the precise features that set the two apart remain unclear. In the standard quantum circuit model, adding a 1-qubit basis-changing gate -- commonly chosen to be the Hadamard gate -- to a universal set of classical reversible gates yields computationally universal quantum computation. However, the computational behaviours enabled by this addition are not fully characterised. We give such a characterisation by introducing a small quantum programming language extending the universal classical reversible programming language $Π$ with a single primitive corresponding to the Hadamard gate. The language comes equipped with a sound and complete categorical semantics that is specified by a purely equational theory. Completeness is shown by means of a novel finite presentation, and a corresponding synthesis algorithm, for the groups of orthogonal matrices with entries in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]$.</p></details> | <details><summary>116 p...</summary><p>116 pages; v2: Extended version of POPL 2026 publication</p></details> |
| **[Searching Latent Program Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08706v3)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General intelligence requires systems that acquire new skills efficiently and generalize beyond their training distributions. Although program synthesis approaches have strong generalization power, they face scaling issues due to the large combinatorial spaces that quickly render them impractical, requiring human-generated DSLs or pre-trained priors to narrow this search space. On the other hand, deep learning methods have had high successes, but they lack structured test-time adaptation and rely on heavy stochastic sampling or expensive gradient updates for fine-tuning. In this work, we propose the Latent Program Network (LPN), a novel architecture that builds in test-time search directly into neural models. LPN learns a latent space of implicit programs -- neurally mapping inputs to outputs -- through which it can search using gradients at test time. LPN combines the adaptability of symbolic approaches and the scalability of neural methods. It searches through a compact latent space at test time and bypasses the need for pre-defined domain-specific languages. On a range of programming-by-examples tasks, LPN either outperforms or matches performance compared to in-context learning and test-time training methods. Tested on the ARC-AGI benchmark, we demonstrate that LPN can both learn a compact program space and search through it at test time to adapt to novel tasks. LPN doubles its performance on out-of-distribution tasks when test-time search is switched on.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 spotlight.

| **[Node Preservation and its Effect on Crossover in Cartesian Genetic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00634v2)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While crossover is a critical and often indispensable component in other forms of Genetic Programming, such as Linear- and Tree-based, it has consistently been claimed that it deteriorates search performance in CGP. As a result, a mutation-alone $(1+λ)$ evolutionary strategy has become the canonical approach for CGP. Although several operators have been developed that demonstrate an increased performance over the canonical method, a general solution to the problem is still lacking. In this paper, we compare basic crossover methods, namely one-point and uniform, to variants in which nodes are ``preserved,'' including the subgraph crossover developed by Roman Kalkreuth, the difference being that when ``node preservation'' is active, crossover is not allowed to break apart instructions. We also compare a node mutation operator to the traditional point mutation; the former simply replaces an entire node with a new one. We find that node preservation in both mutation and crossover improves search using symbolic regression benchmark problems, moving the field towards a general solution to CGP crossover.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft to cite in another paper before both papers are peer-reviewed for the evo*2026 conference, 21 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

| **[Can LLMs Recover Program Semantics? A Systematic Evaluation with Symbolic Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19130v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Obfuscation poses a persistent challenge for software engineering tasks such as program comprehension, maintenance, testing, and vulnerability detection. While compiler optimizations and third-party code often introduce transformations that obscure program intent, existing analysis tools and large language models (LLMs) struggle to recover the original semantics. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs, when fine-tuned with symbolic execution artifacts, can effectively deobfuscate programs and restore analyzability. We construct a benchmark by applying four widely studied transformations-control-flow flattening, opaque predicates, arithmetic encoding, and branch encoding-across diverse C programs from TUM Obfuscation Benchmarks, the LLVM test suite, and algorithmic repositories. We then compare three state-of-the-art LLMs under two training configurations: baseline fine-tuning on obfuscated/original code pairs, and enhanced fine-tuning with additional KLEE artifacts such as SMT constraints, path statistics, and test cases. Our evaluation examines syntactic correctness (compilation success), semantic fidelity (behavioral equivalence under symbolic execution), and code quality (readability and structure). Results show that GPT-4.1-mini achieves the strongest deobfuscation overall, and that incorporating KLEE artifacts consistently improves semantic preservation and compilation success across models. These findings highlight deobfuscation as a broader software engineering concern, demonstrating that combining LLMs with symbolic execution can strengthen automated testing, static analysis, and program comprehension in the presence of obfuscation.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Chatbots in High School Programming: Exploring Behaviors and Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18985v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study uses a Design-Based Research (DBR) cycle to refine the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high school programming education. The initial problem was identified in an Intervention Group where, in an unguided setting, a higher proportion of executive, solution-seeking queries correlated strongly and negatively with exam performance. A contemporaneous Comparison Group demonstrated that without guidance, these unproductive help-seeking patterns do not self-correct, with engagement fluctuating and eventually declining. This insight prompted a mid-course pedagogical intervention in the first group, designed to teach instrumental help-seeking. The subsequent evaluation confirmed the intervention's success, revealing a decrease in executive queries, as well as a shift toward more productive learning workflows. However, this behavioral change did not translate into a statistically significant improvement in exam grades, suggesting that altering tool-use strategies alone may be insufficient to overcome foundational knowledge gaps. The DBR process thus yields a more nuanced principle: the educational value of an LLM depends on a pedagogy that scaffolds help-seeking, but this is only one part of the complex process of learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthesizing Visual Concepts as Vision-Language Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18964v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks but often fail at systematic visual reasoning tasks, leading to inconsistent or illogical outputs. Neuro-symbolic methods promise to address this by inducing interpretable logical rules, though they exploit rigid, domain-specific perception modules. We propose Vision-Language Programs (VLP), which combine the perceptual flexibility of VLMs with systematic reasoning of program synthesis. Rather than embedding reasoning inside the VLM, VLP leverages the model to produce structured visual descriptions that are compiled into neuro-symbolic programs. The resulting programs execute directly on images, remain consistent with task constraints, and provide human-interpretable explanations that enable easy shortcut mitigation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that VLPs outperform direct and structured prompting, particularly on tasks requiring complex logical reasoning.</p></details> |  |

Yet many of these suggestions are ignored, resulting in wasted computation, increased latency, and unnecessary interruptions. We introduce a lightweight pre-filtering model that predicts the likelihood of suggestion acceptance before invoking the LLM, using only real-time developer telemetry such as typing speed, file navigation, and editing activity. Deployed in a production-grade Visual Studio Code plugin over four months of naturalistic use, our approach nearly doubled acceptance rates (18.4% -> 34.2%) while suppressing 35% of low-value LLM calls. These findings demonstrate that behavioral signals alone can meaningfully improve both user experience and system efficiency in LLM-assisted programming, highlighting the value of timing-aware, privacy-preserving adaptation mechanisms. The filter operates solely on pre-invocation editor telemetry and never inspects code or prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

| **[Summary-Mediated Repair: Can LLMs use code summarisation as a tool for program repair?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18782v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce code with subtle implementation-level bugs despite strong benchmark performance. These errors are hard for LLMs to spot and can have large behavioural effects; yet when asked to summarise code, LLMs can frequently surface high-level intent and sometimes overlook this low-level noise. Motivated by this, we propose summary-mediated repair, a prompt-only pipeline for program repair that leverages natural-language code summarisation as an explicit intermediate step, extending previous work that has already shown code summarisation to be a useful intermediary for downstream tasks. We evaluate our method across eight production-grade LLMs on two function level benchmarks (HumanEvalPack and MBPP), comparing several summary styles against a direct repair baseline. Error-aware diagnostic summaries consistently yield the largest gains - repairing up to 65% of unseen errors, on average of 5% more than the baseline - though overall improvements are modest and LLM-dependent. Our results position summaries as a cheap, human-interpretable diagnostic artefact that can be integrated into program-repair pipelines rather than a stand-alone fix-all.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Toward Trustworthy Difficulty Assessments: Large Language Models as Judges in Programming and Synthetic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18597v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language and code generation, and are increasingly deployed as automatic judges of model outputs and learning activities. Yet, their behavior on structured tasks such as predicting the difficulty of competitive programming problems remains under-explored. We conduct a systematic comparison of GPT-4o, used purely as a natural-language difficulty assessor, against an interpretable Light-GBM ensemble trained on explicit numeric and textual features. On a dataset of 1,825 LeetCode problems labeled Easy, Medium, or Hard, LightGBM attains 86% accuracy, whereas GPT-4o reaches only 37.75%. Detailed analyses, including confusion matrices and SHAP-based interpretability, show that numeric constraints -- such as input size limits and acceptance rates -- play a crucial role in separating Hard problems from easier ones. By contrast, GPT-4o often overlooks these cues and exhibits a strong bias toward simpler categories. We further probe GPT-4o through a synthetic Hard-problem generation protocol. Surprisingly, GPT-4o labels almost all of its own synthetic Hard problems as Medium, contradicting its tendency to downgrade real Hard problems to Easy. Our findings connect to recent work on LLMs-as-judges and automatic difficulty estimation in programming and education, and highlight concrete failure modes that must be addressed before LLM-based judges can be considered trustworthy in competitive programming, educational platforms, or reinforcement-learning pipelines.</p></details> |  |

| **[Bounded Exhaustive Random Program Generation for Testing Solidity Compilers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20332v6)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By July 2025, smart contracts collectively manage roughly $120 billion in assets. With Solidity remaining the dominant language for smart contract development, the correctness of Solidity compilers has become critically important. However, Solidity compilers are bug-prone, with a recent study revealing that combinations of qualifiers in Solidity programs are the primary cause of compiler crashes, accounting for 40.5% of all historical crashes. While random program generators are widely used for compiler testing, they may be less effective at finding Solidity compiler bugs because they explore the unbounded space of possible programs rather than concentrating on the specific subspace related to bug-prone qualifiers. A promising idea for finding qualifier-related bugs is to bound the search space based on empirical evidence of where such bugs are likely to occur, specifically focusing test generation to target subspaces with rich combinations of qualifiers. To address this, we propose bounded exhaustive random program generation, a novel approach that dynamically bounds the search space, enhancing the likelihood of uncovering Solidity compiler bugs. Specifically, our method bounds the search space by generating valid program templates that abstract programs that use bug-prone qualifiers, and then uses these templates as a basis for compiler testing through exhaustive enumeration of suitable qualifiers. Mechanisms are devised to address technical challenges regarding validity and efficiency. We have implemented our novel generation approach in a new tool, Erwin. We have used Erwin to find and report 26 bugs across two Solidity compilers, solc and solang, and one Solidity static analyzer, slither. Among these, 23 were previously unknown, 18 have been confirmed, and 10 have been fixed. Evaluation results demonstrate that Erwin outperforms state-of-the-art Solidity fuzzers in bug detection.</p></details> |  |

Our framework is based on a many-sorted system of hybrid modal logic, for which we prove completeness results. We believe that our approach to program verification improves over the existing approaches within modal logic as (1) it is based on operational semantics which allows for a more natural description of the execution than Hoare's style weakest precondition used by dynamic logic; (2) being multi-sorted, it allows for a clearer encoding of semantics, with a smaller representational distance to its intended meaning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Graph burning: an overview of mathematical programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18292v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Graph Burning Problem (GBP) is a combinatorial optimization problem that has gained relevance as a tool for quantifying a graph's vulnerability to contagion. Although it is based on a very simple propagation model, its decision version is NP-complete, and its optimization version is NP-hard. Many of its theoretical properties across different graph families have been thoroughly explored, and numerous interesting variants have been proposed. This paper reports novel mathematical programs for the optimization version of the classical GBP. Among the presented programs are a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP), a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), two Integer Linear Programs (ILP), and two Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. Most optimization solvers can handle these, being QUBO problems of a capital interest in quantum computing. The primary aim of this paper is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the GBP by examining its different formulations. Compared to other mathematical programs from the literature, the ones presented here are conceptually simpler and involve fewer variables. These make them more practical for finding optimal solutions using optimization algorithms and solvers, as we show by solving some instances with millions of vertices in just a few minutes.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |

Training-Free Adaptation of Programmatic Agents via LLM-Guided Program Synthesis in Dynamic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11425v2)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous agents in safety-critical applications must continuously adapt to dynamic conditions without compromising performance and reliability. This work introduces TAPA (Training-free Adaptation of Programmatic Agents), a novel framework that positions large language models (LLMs) as intelligent moderators of the symbolic action space. Unlike prior programmatic agents typically generate a monolithic policy program or rely on fixed symbolic action sets, TAPA synthesizes and adapts modular programs for individual high-level actions, referred to as logical primitives. By decoupling strategic intent from execution, TAPA enables meta-agents to operate over an abstract, interpretable action space while the LLM dynamically generates, composes, and refines symbolic programs tailored to each primitive. Extensive experiments across cybersecurity and swarm intelligence domains validate TAPA's effectiveness. In autonomous DDoS defense scenarios, TAPA achieves 77.7% network uptime while maintaining near-perfect detection accuracy in unknown dynamic environments. In swarm intelligence formation control under environmental and adversarial disturbances, TAPA consistently preserves consensus at runtime where baseline methods fail. This work promotes a paradigm shift for autonomous system design in evolving environments, from policy adaptation to dynamic action adaptation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of the paper accepted at AAAI-26 Oral to comply with the AAAI camera-ready requirements with minor revisions</p></details> |
| **[Minimizing energy dissipation during programming of resistive switching memory devices using their dynamical attractor states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18053v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Under certain conditions, applying a sequence of voltage pulses of alternating polarities across a resistive switching memory device induces a finite number of fixed-point attractors, known as dynamical attractors. Remarkably, dynamical attractors can be used to program analog values into the device state without supervision. Because different pulse sequences can produce the same trajectory solution for the state in the phase space, there is strong potential for optimization, particularly in regard to the energy cost of the programming phase, which this study addresses. Without loss of generality, the proposed theory-based energy minimization strategy is applied to the voltage threshold adaptive memristor model, known for its predictive capability and adaptability to fit a large number of resistance switching memory devices. The optimization design crafts ad-hoc pulse sequences, that minimize the energy required to program the device into a desired dynamical attractor state. The theoretical approach is also extended to cover situations, where a fast programming scheme should be adopted to serve time-critical electronics applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Automated Program Repair via Faulty Token Localization and Quality-Aware Patch Refinement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18001v1)** | 2025-11-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential for automated program repair (APR). However, existing LLM-based techniques primarily rely on coarse-grained external feedback (e.g.,test results) to guide iterative patch generation, while lacking fine-grained internal signals that reveal why a patch fails or which parts of the generated code are likely incorrect. This limitation often leads to inefficient refinement, error propagation, and suboptimal repair performance. In this work, we propose TokenRepair, a novel two-level refinement framework that enhances APR by integrating internal reflection for localizing potentially faulty tokens with external feedback for quality-aware patch refinement. Specifically, TokenRepair first performs internal reflection by analyzing context-aware token-level uncertainty fluctuations to identify suspicious or low-confidence tokens within a patch. It then applies Chain-of-Thought guided rewriting to refine only these localized tokens, enabling targeted and fine-grained correction. To further stabilize the iterative repair loop, TokenRepair incorporates a quality-aware external feedback mechanism that evaluates patch quality and filters out low-quality candidates before refinement. Experimental results show that TokenRepair achieves new state-of-the-art repair performance, correctly fixing 88 bugs on Defects4J 1.2 and 139 bugs on HumanEval-Java, demonstrating substantial improvements ranging from 8.2% to 34.9% across all models on Defects4J 1.2 and from 3.3% to 16.1% on HumanEval-Java.</p></details> |  |

Today, that gateway is widening with advances in large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI)-powered coding assistants. What matters is no longer just fluency in traditional programming languages but the ability to think computationally by translating problems into forms that can be solved with computing tools. The capabilities enabled by these AI-augmented tools are rapidly leading to the commoditization of computational thinking, such that anyone who can articulate a problem in natural language can potentially harness computing power via AI. This shift is poised to radically influence how we teach computer science and data science in the United States and around the world. Educators and industry leaders are grappling with how to adapt: What should students learn when the hottest new programming language is English? How do we prepare a generation of computational thinkers who need not code every algorithm manually, but must still think critically, design solutions, and verify AI-augmented results? This paper explores these questions, examining the impact of natural language programming on software development, the emerging distinction between programmers and prompt-crafting problem solvers, the reforms needed in computer science and data science curricula, and the importance of maintaining our fundamental computational science principles in an AI-augmented future. Along the way, we compare approaches and share best practices for embracing this new paradigm in computing education.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages and 17 figures</p></details> |
| **[Agentic Program Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.17330v1)** | 2025-11-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically generated code is gaining traction recently, owing to the prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs). Further, the AlphaProof initiative has demonstrated the possibility of using AI for general mathematical reasoning. Reasoning about computer programs (software) can be accomplished via general mathematical reasoning; however, it tends to be more structured and richer in contexts. This forms an attractive proposition, since then AI agents can be used to reason about voluminous code that gets generated by AI. In this work, we present a first LLM agent, AutoRocq, for conducting program verification. Unlike past works, which rely on extensive training of LLMs on proof examples, our agent learns on-the-fly and improves the proof via an iterative refinement loop. The iterative improvement of the proof is achieved by the proof agent communicating with the Rocq (formerly Coq) theorem prover to get additional context and feedback. The final result of the iteration is a proof derivation checked by the Rocq theorem prover. In this way, our proof construction involves autonomous collaboration between the proof agent and the theorem prover. This autonomy facilitates the search for proofs and decision-making in deciding on the structure of the proof tree. Experimental evaluation on SV-COMP benchmarks and on Linux kernel modules shows promising efficacy in achieving automated program verification. As automation in code generation becomes more widespread, we posit that our proof agent can be potentially integrated with AI coding agents to achieve a generate and validate loop, thus moving closer to the vision of trusted automatic programming.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |

At the same time, recent work has demonstrated the possibility of interpreting higher-order probabilistic programming languages in the framework of tropical mathematics, by exploiting algebraic and categorical tools coming from the semantics of linear logic. In this work we combine these two worlds, showing that tools and ideas from tropical geometry can be used to perform statistical inference over higher-order probabilistic programs. Notably, we first show that each such program can be associated with a degree and a n-dimensional polyhedron that encode its most likely runs. Then, we use these tools in order to design an intersection type system that estimates most likely runs in a compositional and efficient way.</p></details> |  |
| **[Oracular Programming: A Modular Foundation for Building LLM-Enabled Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.05310v3)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models can solve a wide range of tasks from just a few examples, but they remain difficult to steer and lack a capability essential for building reliable software at scale: the modular composition of computations under enforceable contracts. As a result, they are typically embedded in larger software pipelines that use domain-specific knowledge to decompose tasks and improve reliability through validation and search. Yet the complexity of writing, tuning, and maintaining such pipelines has so far limited their sophistication. We propose oracular programming: a foundational paradigm for integrating traditional, explicit computations with inductive oracles such as LLMs. It rests on two directing principles: the full separation of core and search logic, and the treatment of few-shot examples as grounded and evolvable program components. Within this paradigm, experts express high-level problem-solving strategies as programs with unresolved choice points. These choice points are resolved at runtime by LLMs, which generalize from user-provided examples of correct and incorrect decisions. An oracular program is composed of three orthogonal components: a strategy that consists in a nondeterministic program with choice points that can be reified into a search tree, a policy that specifies how to navigate this tree with the help of LLM oracles, and a set of demonstrations that describe successful and unsuccessful tree navigation scenarios across diverse problem instances. Each component is expressed in a dedicated programming language and can be independently improved or substituted. We address the key programming language design challenges of modularly composing oracular programs and enforcing consistency between their components as they evolve.</p></details> |  |

It is no longer necessary to be a computer specialist to use them. Paradoxically, the development of computer programs generally requires writing lines of code in a programming language whose syntax is particularly strict. This process poses many diculties for programmers. We propose an original tool in which arbitrary programs (Turing-complete) can be developed in a completely visual manner by direct manipulation of the data, without writing a line of code. The user can thus develop an algorithm by directly visualizing the result of actions taken on the data. A method for constructing iterations is associated with the tool. It proposes to create each part, including the loop body, in a non-linear manner under visual control of the state of the data. In addition, the tool supports the production of code that corresponds to the actions performed, where the language can be Python, C, or Java. In this article, we present the tool, the design choices, the problems solved, and the limits and contributions of the direct-data-manipulation approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Aligned Constraint Programming Model For Serial Batch Scheduling With Minimum Batch Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16045v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In serial batch (s-batch) scheduling, jobs from similar families are grouped into batches and processed sequentially to avoid repetitive setups that are required when processing consecutive jobs of different families. Despite its large success in scheduling, only three Constraint Programming (CP) models have been proposed for this problem considering minimum batch sizes, which is a common requirement in many practical settings, including the ion implantation area in semiconductor manufacturing. These existing CP models rely on a predefined virtual set of possible batches that suffers from the curse of dimensionality and adds complexity to the problem. This paper proposes a novel CP model that does not rely on this virtual set. Instead, it uses key alignment parameters that allow it to reason directly on the sequences of same-family jobs scheduled on the machines, resulting in a more compact formulation. This new model is further improved by exploiting the problem's structure with tailored search phases and strengthened inference levels of the constraint propagators. The extensive computational experiments on nearly five thousand instances compare the proposed models against existing methods in the literature, including mixed-integer programming formulations, tabu search meta-heuristics, and CP approaches. The results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed models on small-to-medium instances with up to 100 jobs, and their ability to find solutions up to 25\% better than the ones produces by existing methods on large-scale instances with up to 500 jobs, 10 families, and 10 machines.</p></details> | 14 pages, 12 figures |
| **[HGCN2SP: Hierarchical Graph Convolutional Network for Two-Stage Stochastic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.16027v1)** | 2025-11-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-stage Stochastic Programming (2SP) is a standard framework for modeling decision-making problems under uncertainty. While numerous methods exist, solving such problems with many scenarios remains challenging. Selecting representative scenarios is a practical method for accelerating solutions. However, current approaches typically rely on clustering or Monte Carlo sampling, failing to integrate scenario information deeply and overlooking the significant impact of the scenario order on solving time. To address these issues, we develop HGCN2SP, a novel model with a hierarchical graph designed for 2SP problems, encoding each scenario and modeling their relationships hierarchically. The model is trained in a reinforcement learning paradigm to utilize the feedback of the solver. The policy network is equipped with a hierarchical graph convolutional network for feature encoding and an attention-based decoder for scenario selection in proper order. Evaluation of two classic 2SP problems demonstrates that HGCN2SP provides high-quality decisions in a short computational time. Furthermore, HGCN2SP exhibits remarkable generalization capabilities in handling large-scale instances, even with a substantial number of variables or scenarios that were unseen during the training phase.</p></details> | 17 pages, 4 figures |

It is well-known that general BLPs are strongly $NP$-hard, even when the leader's and the follower's objective functions are exact opposites. However, the complexity classification of BLPs remains incomplete when one of the decision-makers has a fixed number of variables or constraints. In particular, it has been shown that optimistic BLPs are polynomially solvable when the number of follower variables is fixed, whereas both optimistic and pessimistic BLPs remain $NP$-hard even with a single leader variable and no upper-level constraints. In this note, we close the remaining gap in this complexity landscape. Specifically, we prove that BLPs are polynomially solvable in both the optimistic and the pessimistic settings when the number of follower constraints is fixed. In contrast, we also show that the pessimistic problem with a fixed number of follower variables is strongly $NP$-hard. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first result demonstrating that, under comparable assumptions, the pessimistic formulation is one complexity class harder than its optimistic counterpart.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tighter Bounds for the Randomized Polynomial-Time Simplex Algorithm for Linear Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14244v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a randomized polynomial-time simplex algorithm with higher probability and tighter bounds for linear programming by applying improved quasi-convex properties, a logarithmic rounding on a given polytope and its logarithmic perturbation. We base our work on the first randomized polynomial-time simplex method by Jonathan A. Kelner and Daniel A. Spielman [KS06]. We obtain stronger bounds for the expected number of edges in the projection of a perturbed polytope onto a two-dimensional shadow plane. In the $k$-round case, we obtain a bound of $16 \sqrt{2} πk (1 + λH_n) \sqrt{d} n / 3 λ$. In the non-$k$-round case, we obtain a bound of $26 πt (1 + λH_n) \sqrt{d} n / λρ$. To achieve this, we provide a slightly lower bound of $3 \sqrt{2} λ/ (16 n \sqrt{d})$ on the expected edge length that appears in the shadow. Another tool we employ is a tighter bound for $1$-quasi-concave minimization and $1$-quasi-convex maximization. In the $k$-round case, we obtain a quasi-convex bound of $(d - 2) ε^2 / 2$. In the non-$k$-round case, we obtain a quasi-convex bound of $3.4 ε^2 / ρ^2$. We propose a modification of the Kelner and Spielman randomized simplex algorithm (STOC'06) [KS06] that achieves a higher success probability. To accomplish this, we apply our tighter bounds with a new expected value of $λ= c \log n$ for independent exponentially distributed random variables and with $\log(k)$-rounding. The desired properties resulting from the construction of an artificial vertex during initialization hold with a higher probability of at least $1 - (d + 2), e^{-\log n}$. The pivot rule of the randomized simplex modification holds with a probability of at least $3/4$.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Words Change the Model: Sensitivity of LLMs for Constraint Programming Modelling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.14334v2)** | 2025-11-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the long-standing goals in optimisation and constraint programming is to describe a problem in natural language and automatically obtain an executable, efficient model. Large language models appear to bring this vision closer, showing impressive results in automatically generating models for classical benchmarks. However, much of this apparent success may derive from data contamination rather than genuine reasoning: many standard CP problems are likely included in the training data of these models. To examine this hypothesis, we systematically rephrased and perturbed a set of well-known CSPLib problems to preserve their structure while modifying their context and introducing misleading elements. We then compared the models produced by three representative LLMs across original and modified descriptions. Our qualitative analysis shows that while LLMs can produce syntactically valid and semantically plausible models, their performance drops sharply under contextual and linguistic variation, revealing shallow understanding and sensitivity to wording.</p></details> |  |

The Linux kernel poses unique challenges due to its monolithic structure, concurrency, and low-level hardware interactions. Prior efforts such as KGym and CrashFixer have highlighted the difficulty of APR in this domain, reporting low success rates or relying on costly and complex pipelines and pricey cloud infrastructure. In this work, we introduce RGym, a lightweight, platform-agnostic APR evaluation framework for the Linux kernel designed to operate on local commodity hardware. Built on RGym, we propose a simple yet effective APR pipeline leveraging specialized localization techniques (e.g., call stacks and blamed commits) to overcome the unrealistic usage of oracles in KGym. We test on a filtered and verified dataset of 143 bugs. Our method achieves up to a 43.36% pass rate with GPT-5 Thinking while maintaining a cost of under $0.20 per bug. We further conduct an ablation study to analyze contributions from our proposed localization strategy, prompt structure, and model choice, and demonstrate that feedback-based retries can significantly enhance success rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>39th ...</summary><p>39th Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NeurIPS 2025) Workshop: Evaluating the Evolving LLM Lifecycle: Benchmarks, Emergent Abilities, and Scaling</p></details> |

Traditional RTL design in languages like SystemVerilog composes modules through wiring-style connections that provide weak guarantees for behavioral correctness. While high-level synthesis (HLS) and emerging abstractions attempt to address this, they either introduce unpredictable overhead or restrict design generality. Although transactional HDLs provide a promising foundation by lifting design abstraction to atomic and composable rules, they solely model intra-cycle behavior and do not reflect the native temporal design characteristics, hindering applicability and productivity for FPGA programming scenarios. We propose temporal hardware transactions, a new abstraction that brings cycle-level timing awareness to designers at the transactional language level. Our approach models temporal relationships between rules and supports the description of rules whose actions span multiple clock cycles, providing intuitive abstraction to describe multi-cycle architectural behavior. We implement this in Cement2, a transactional HDL embedded in Rust, enabling programming hardware constructors to build both intra-cycle and temporal transactions. Cement2's synthesis framework lowers description abstraction through multiple analysis and optimization phases, generating efficient hardware. With Cement2's abstraction, we program a RISC-V soft-core processor, custom CPU instructions, linear algebra kernels, and systolic array accelerators, leveraging the high-level abstraction for boosted productivity. Evaluation shows that Cement2 does not sacrifice performance and resources compared to hand-coded RTL designs, demonstrating the high applicability for general FPGA design tasks.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating and analyzing their logical reasoning abilities has therefore become essential. However, existing datasets and benchmarks are often limited to overly simplistic, unnatural, or contextually constrained examples. In response to the growing demand, we introduce SmartyPat-Bench, a challenging, naturally expressed, and systematically labeled benchmark derived from real-world high-quality Reddit posts containing subtle logical fallacies. Unlike existing datasets and benchmarks, it provides more detailed annotations of logical fallacies and features more diverse data. To further scale up the study and address the limitations of manual data collection and labeling - such as fallacy-type imbalance and labor-intensive annotation - we introduce SmartyPat, an automated framework powered by logic programming-based oracles. SmartyPat utilizes Prolog rules to systematically generate logically fallacious statements, which are then refined into fluent natural-language sentences by LLMs, ensuring precise fallacy representation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that SmartyPat produces fallacies comparable in subtlety and quality to human-generated content and significantly outperforms baseline methods. Finally, experiments reveal nuanced insights into LLM capabilities, highlighting that while excessive reasoning steps hinder fallacy detection accuracy, structured reasoning enhances fallacy categorization performance.</p></details> |  |

These call for compassionate pedagogies and Universal Design For Learning (UDL) to create learning environments and materials where cognitive diversity is welcomed. To address this, we introduce DiverseClaire a pilot study, which simulates students including neurodiverse profiles using LLMs and diverse personas. By leveraging Bloom's Taxonomy and UDL, DiverseClaire compared UDL-transformed lecture slides with traditional formats. To evaluate DiverseClaire controlled experiments, we used the evaluation metric the average score. The findings revealed that the simulated neurodiverse students struggled with learning due to lecture slides that were in inaccessible formats. These results highlight the need to provide course materials in multiple formats for diverse learner preferences. Data from our pilot study will be made available to assist future CS1 instructors.</p></details> | 2 pages |

However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present AgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph intermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations (e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system. AgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that reconstructs the agent's runtime traces as graph-based intermediate representations with control and data flow described within; (2) a property registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools \& data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over the intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured programs, AgentArmor enables program analysis for sensitive data flow, trust boundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo benchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can reduce the ASR to 3\%, with the utility drop only 1\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Infrequent Resolving Algorithm for Online Linear Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00465v6)** | 2025-11-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online linear programming (OLP) has gained significant attention from both researchers and practitioners due to its extensive applications, such as online auction, network revenue management, order fulfillment and advertising. Existing OLP algorithms fall into two categories: LP-based algorithms and LP-free algorithms. The former one typically guarantees better performance but requires solving a large number of LPs, which could be computationally expensive. In contrast, LP-free algorithm only requires first-order computations but induces a worse performance. In this work, we bridge the gap between these two extremes by proposing a well-performing algorithm, that solves LPs at a few selected time points and conducts first-order computations at other time points. Specifically, for the case where the inputs are drawn from an unknown finite-support distribution, the proposed algorithm achieves a constant regret (even for the hard "degenerate" case) while solving LPs only O(log log T) times over the time horizon T. Moreover, when we are allowed to solve LPs only M times, we design the corresponding schedule such that the proposed algorithm can guarantee a nearly O(T^((1/2)^(M-1)) regret. Our work highlights the value of resolving both at the beginning and the end of the selling horizon, and provides a novel framework to prove the performance guarantee of the proposed policy under different infrequent resolving schedules. Numerical experiments are conducted to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>With ...</summary><p>With very few resolvings, we can achieve constant regret (even without the non-degeneracy assumption) for OLP and NRM problems</p></details> |

We present KForge, a platform-agnostic framework built on two collaborative LLM-based agents: a generation agent that produces and iteratively refines programs through compilation and correctness feedback, and a performance analysis agent that interprets profiling data to guide optimization. This agent-based architecture requires only a single-shot example to target new platforms. We make three key contributions: (1) introducing an iterative refinement system where the generation agent and performance analysis agent collaborate through functional and optimization passes, interpreting diverse profiling data (from programmatic APIs to GUI-based tools) to generate actionable recommendations that guide program synthesis for arbitrary accelerators; (2) demonstrating that the generation agent effectively leverages cross-platform knowledge transfer, where a reference implementation from one architecture substantially improves generation quality for different hardware targets; and (3) validating the platform-agnostic nature of our approach by demonstrating effective program synthesis across fundamentally different parallel computing platforms: NVIDIA CUDA and Apple Metal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under review at MLSys 2026</p></details> |

Existing research has primarily focused on GenAI's ability to complete educational tasks and its impact on student performance, often overlooking its effects on knowledge gains. In this study, we investigate how GenAI assistance compares to conventional online resources in supporting knowledge gains across different proficiency levels. We conducted a controlled user experiment with 24 undergraduate students of two different levels of programming experience (beginner, intermediate) to examine how students interact with ChatGPT while solving programming tasks. We analyzed task performance, conceptual understanding, and interaction behaviors. Our findings reveal that generating complete solutions with GenAI significantly improves task performance, especially for beginners, but does not consistently result in knowledge gains. Importantly, usage strategies differ by experience: beginners tend to rely heavily on GenAI toward task completion often without knowledge gain in the process, while intermediates adopt more selective approaches. We find that both over-reliance and minimal use result in weaker knowledge gains overall. Based on our results, we call on students and educators to adopt GenAI as a learning rather than a problem solving tool. Our study highlights the urgent need for guidance when integrating GenAI into programming education to foster deeper understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, accepted at AIWARE 2025</p></details> |

This aims at enabling individuals without programming experience but with knowledge in specific target domains to design and (re)configure autonomous software. We argue that, compared to procedural programming, it should be simpler for users to create programs when agent abstractions are employed. The underlying rationale is that these abstractions, and specifically the belief-desire-intention architecture that is aligned with human practical reasoning, match more closely with people's everyday experience in interacting with other agents and artifacts in the real world. On top of this, we designed and implemented a visual programming system for agents that hides the technicalities of agent-oriented programming using a blocks-based visual development environment that is built on the JaCaMo platform. To further validate the proposed solution, we integrate the Web of Things (WoT) to let users create autonomous behaviour on top of physical mashups of devices, following the trends in industrial end-user programming. Finally, we report on a pilot user study where we verified that novice users are indeed able to make use of this development environment to create multi-agent systems to solve simple automation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted and presented at the 10th International Workshop on Engineering Multi-Agent Systems (EMAS 2022), 9-10 May 2022, Auckland, New Zealand</p></details> |

Direct prompting often yields incomplete or structurally invalid outputs--such as misclassified triggers, missing arguments, and schema violations. To address these limitations, we present Agent-Event-Coder (AEC), a novel multi-agent framework that treats event extraction like software engineering: as a structured, iterative code-generation process. AEC decomposes ZSEE into specialized subtasks--retrieval, planning, coding, and verification--each handled by a dedicated LLM agent. Event schemas are represented as executable class definitions, enabling deterministic validation and precise feedback via a verification agent. This programming-inspired approach allows for systematic disambiguation and schema enforcement through iterative refinement. By leveraging collaborative agent workflows, AEC enables LLMs to produce precise, complete, and schema-consistent extractions in zero-shot settings. Experiments across five diverse domains and six LLMs demonstrate that AEC consistently outperforms prior zero-shot baselines, showcasing the power of treating event extraction like code generation. The code and data are released on https://github.com/UESTC-GQJ/Agent-Event-Coder.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, accepted by AAAI 2026 (Oral)</p></details> |

Recently, Sakaue and Oki proposed a data-driven approach for linear programs (LPs), where the projection matrix is learned from observed problem instances drawn from an application-specific distribution of problems. We analyze the generalization guarantee for the data-driven projection matrix learning for convex quadratic programs (QPs). Unlike in LPs, the optimal solutions of convex QPs are not confined to the vertices of the feasible polyhedron, and this complicates the analysis of the optimal value function. To overcome this challenge, we demonstrate that the solutions of convex QPs can be localized within a feasible region corresponding to a special active set, utilizing Caratheodory's theorem. Building on such observation, we propose the unrolled active set method, which models the computation of the optimal value as a Goldberg-Jerrum (GJ) algorithm with bounded complexities, thereby establishing learning guarantees. We then further extend our analysis to other settings, including learning to match the optimal solution and input-aware setting, where we learn a mapping from QP problem instances to projection matrices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Greedy optimization methods, commonly used for LPC, alternate between clustering and linear regression but lack global optimality. While effective for separable clusters, they struggle in non-separable settings where clusters overlap in feature space. In an alternative constrained optimization paradigm, Bertsimas and Shioda (2007) formulated LPC as a Mixed-Integer Program (MIP), ensuring global optimality regardless of separability but suffering from poor scalability. This work builds on the constrained optimization paradigm to introduce two novel approaches that improve the efficiency of global optimization for LPC. By leveraging key theoretical properties of separability, we derive near-optimal approximations with provable error bounds, significantly reducing the MIP formulation's complexity and improving scalability. Additionally, we can further approximate LPC as a Quadratic Pseudo-Boolean Optimization (QPBO) problem, achieving substantial computational improvements in some settings. Comparative analyses on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our methods consistently achieve near-optimal solutions with substantially lower regression errors than greedy optimization while exhibiting superior scalability over existing MIP formulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Programming Techniques for Enhancing Cognitive Representation in Knowledge Tracing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02949v2)** | 2025-11-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Tracing (KT) involves monitoring the changes in a student's knowledge over time by analyzing their past responses, with the goal of predicting future performance. However, most existing methods primarily focus on feature enhancement, while overlooking the deficiencies in cognitive representation and the ability to express cognition-issues often caused by interference from non-cognitive factors such as slipping and guessing. This limitation hampers the ability to capture the continuity and coherence of the student's cognitive process. As a result, many methods may introduce more prediction bias and modeling costs due to their inability to maintain cognitive continuity and coherence. Based on the above discussion, we propose the Cognitive Representation Dynamic Programming based Knowledge Tracing (CRDP-KT) model. This model em ploys a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize cognitive representations based on the difficulty of the questions and the performance intervals between them. This approach ensures that the cognitive representation aligns with the student's cognitive patterns, maintaining overall continuity and coherence. As a result, it provides more accurate and systematic input features for subsequent model training, thereby minimizing distortion in the simulation of cognitive states. Additionally, the CRDP-KT model performs partitioned optimization of cognitive representations to enhance the reliability of the optimization process. Furthermore, it improves its ability to express the student's cognition through a weighted fusion of optimized record representations and re lationships learned from a bipartite graph. Finally, experiments conducted on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed CRDP-KT model.</p></details> | <details><summary>There...</summary><p>There are content errors and formatting issues, and it needs to be withdrawn for reprocessing</p></details> |

High-performance implementations typically rely on low-level HIP/CUDA communication libraries that demand substantial engineering effort for even basic overlap patterns, while simpler abstractions often sacrifice performance. We present Iris, a multi-GPU communication library implemented entirely in Python and Triton that eliminates this trade-off. Iris provides tile-based symmetric memory abstractions that naturally align with Triton's programming model, enabling developers to write single-source kernels that seamlessly interleave computation and communication. We demonstrate a taxonomy of compute-communication overlap patterns--from bulk-synchronous to fine-grained workgroup specialization--that can be implemented with minimal code changes in Iris, often requiring just a few additional lines within the same Triton kernel. Our evaluation shows that Iris achieves near-optimal bandwidth utilization in microbenchmarks and delivers up to 1.79x speedup over PyTorch and RCCL for GEMM+All-Scatter workloads, demonstrating that high-level implementations can match or exceed heavily-optimized libraries while dramatically simplifying multi-GPU programming.</p></details> |  |

The standard way that PBT users generate test inputs is via generators that describe how to sample test inputs through random choices. To achieve a good distribution over test inputs, users must tune their generators, i.e., decide on the weights of these individual random choices. Unfortunately, it is very difficult to understand how to choose individual generator weights in order to achieve a desired distribution, so today this process is tedious and limits the distributions that can be practically achieved. In this paper, we develop techniques for the automatic and offline tuning of generators. Given a generator with undetermined symbolic weights and an objective function, our approach automatically learns values for these weights that optimize for the objective. We describe useful objective functions that allow users to (1) target desired distributions and (2) improve the diversity and validity of their test cases. We have implemented our approach in a novel discrete probabilistic programming system, Loaded Dice, that supports differentiation and parameter learning, and use it as a language for generators. We empirically demonstrate that our approach is effective at optimizing generator distributions according to the specified objective functions. We also perform a thorough evaluation on PBT benchmarks, demonstrating that, when automatically tuned for diversity and validity, the generators exhibit a 3.1-7.4x speedup in bug finding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of OOPSLA '25 paper</p></details> |

While some works focus on opportunistic approaches for efficiency, others concentrate on pre-planned trajectories or scheduling for increased interpretability. However, scheduling usually requires knowledge of the environment beforehand, which prevents its deployment in several domains due to related uncertainties (e.g., underwater exploration). In our previous work, we proposed an intermittent communications framework for MRE under communication constraints that uses scheduled rendezvous events to mitigate such limitations. However, the system was unable to generate optimal plans and had no mechanisms to follow the plan considering realistic trajectories, which is not suited for real-world deployments. In this work, we further investigate the problem by formulating the Multi-Robot Exploration with Communication Constraints and Intermittent Connectivity (MRE-CCIC) problem. We propose a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP) formulation to generate rendezvous plans and a policy to follow them based on the Rendezvous Tracking for Unknown Scenarios (RTUS) mechanism. The RTUS is a simple rule to allow robots to follow the assigned plan, considering unknown conditions. Finally, we evaluated our method in a large-scale environment configured in Gazebo simulations. The results suggest that our method can follow the plan promptly and accomplish the task efficiently. We provide an open-source implementation of both the MILP plan generator and the large-scale MRE-CCIC.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures, International Conference on Advanced Robotics</p></details> |
| **[Modular GPU Programming with Typed Perspectives](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11939v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To achieve peak performance on modern GPUs, one must balance two frames of mind: issuing instructions to individual threads to control their behavior, while simultaneously tracking the convergence of many threads acting in concert to perform collective operations like Tensor Core instructions. The tension between these two mindsets makes modular programming error prone. Functions that encapsulate collective operations, despite being called per-thread, must be executed cooperatively by groups of threads. In this work, we introduce Prism, a new GPU language that restores modularity while still giving programmers the low-level control over collective operations necessary for high performance. Our core idea is typed perspectives, which materialize, at the type level, the granularity at which the programmer is controlling the behavior of threads. We describe the design of Prism, implement a compiler for it, and lay its theoretical foundations in a core calculus called Bundl. We implement state-of-the-art GPU kernels in Prism and find that it offers programmers the safety guarantees needed to confidently write modular code without sacrificing performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Recursive Theory of Variational State Estimation: The Dynamic Programming Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11497v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, variational state estimation is examined from the dynamic programming perspective. This leads to two different value functional recursions depending on whether backward or forward dynamic programming is employed. The result is a theory of variational state estimation that corresponds to the classical theory of Bayesian state estimation. More specifically, in the backward method, the value functional corresponds to a likelihood that is upper bounded by the state likelihood from the Bayesian backward recursion. In the forward method, the value functional corresponds to an unnormalized density that is upper bounded by the unnormalized filtering density. Both methods can be combined to arrive at a variational two-filter formula. Additionally, it is noted that optimal variational filtering is generally of quadratic time-complexity in the sequence length. This motivates the notion of sub-optimal variational filtering, which also lower bounds the evidence but is of linear time-complexity. Another problem is the fact that the value functional recursions are generally intractable. This is briefly discussed and a simple approximation is suggested that retrieves the filter proposed by Courts et al. (2021). The methodology is examined in a jump Gauss--Markov system, where it is observed that the value functional recursions are tractable under a certain factored Markov process approximation. A simulation study demonstrates that the posterior approximation is of adequate quality.</p></details> |  |

From a high level, Foxtrot inherits various concurrency reasoning principles from standard concurrent separation logic, e.g. invariants and ghost resources, and supports advanced probabilistic reasoning principles for reasoning about complex probability distributions induced by concurrent threads, e.g. tape presampling and induction by error amplification. The integration of these strong reasoning principles is highly non-trivial due to the combination of probability and concurrency in the language and the complexity of the Foxtrot model; the soundness of the logic relies on a version of the axiom of choice within the Iris logic, which is not used in earlier work on Iris-based logics. We demonstrate the expressiveness of Foxtrot on a wide range of examples, including the adversarial von Neumann coin and the $\mathsf{randombytes\_uniform}$ function of the Sodium cryptography software library. All results have been mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant and the Iris separation logic framework.</p></details> |  |

Task-based programming systems improve modularity by separating performance decisions from application logic, but their mapping interfaces are low-level. We introduce Mapple, a high-level, declarative programming interface for mapping distributed applications. Mapple provides transformation primitives to resolve dimensionality mismatches between task and processor spaces, including a key primitive, decompose, that helps minimize communication volume. We implement Mapple on top of the Legion runtime by translating Mapple mappers into its low-level C++ interface. Across nine applications, including six matrix multiplication algorithms and three scientific computing workloads, Mapple reduces mapper code size by 14x and enables performance improvements of up to 1.34x over expert-written C++ mappers. In addition, the decompose primitive achieves up to 1.83x improvement over existing dimensionality-resolution heuristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimising Density Computations in Probabilistic Programs via Automatic Loop Vectorisation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11070v1)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic programming languages (PPLs) are a popular tool for high-level modelling across many fields. They provide a range of algorithms for probabilistic inference, which analyse models by learning their parameters from a dataset or estimating their posterior distributions. However, probabilistic inference is known to be very costly. One of the bottlenecks of probabilistic inference stems from the iteration over entries of a large dataset or a long series of random samples. Vectorisation can mitigate this cost, but manual vectorisation is error-prone, and existing automatic techniques are often ad-hoc and limited, unable to handle general repetition structures, such as nested loops and loops with data-dependent control flow, without significant user intervention. To address this bottleneck, we propose a sound and effective method for automatically vectorising loops in probabilistic programs. Our method achieves high throughput using speculative parallel execution of loop iterations, while preserving the semantics of the original loop through a fixed-point check. We formalise our method as a translation from an imperative PPL into a lower-level target language with primitives geared towards vectorisation. We implemented our method for the Pyro PPL and evaluated it on a range of probabilistic models. Our experiments show significant performance gains against an existing vectorisation baseline, achieving $1.1$--$6\times$ speedups and reducing GPU memory usage in many cases. Unlike the baseline, which is limited to a subset of models, our method effectively handled all the tested models.</p></details> | <details><summary>70 pa...</summary><p>70 pages, 19 figures, the first two authors contributed equally to this work, accepted at POPL'26</p></details> |
| **[TSAPR: A Tree Search Framework For Automated Program Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01827v4)** | 2025-11-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), traditional Automated Program Repair (APR) techniques have undergone significant transformation. Training-free approaches, such as zero-shot and few-shot prompting, are increasingly favored over fine-tuning-based methods, leveraging the strong code understanding and generation capabilities of LLMs to improve repair effectiveness. However, most existing LLM-based APR systems still follow a trial-and-error paradigm, which faces two fundamental challenges: (1) limited patch quality due to myopic, local exploration; and (2) inefficient search processes caused by redundant or unguided patch generation. To address these limitations, we propose TSAPR, a Tree Search-based APR framework designed for diverse types of software defects. Unlike conventional approaches, TSAPR adopts an evaluate-and-improve paradigm that systematically guides the repair process. Specifically, it integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch exploration, enabling global assessment of candidate patches and prioritizing the most promising ones for iterative refinement and generation. By supporting long-trajectory, multi-path exploration, TSAPR significantly enhances search efficiency while maintaining high flexibility and generality. This design makes it applicable to a wide range of defect types and compatible with various base LLMs. We evaluate TSAPR across five widely used bug and vulnerability benchmarks. Experimental results show that TSAPR successfully repairs 201 out of 835 bugs in Defects4J, outperforming all state-of-the-art baselines. TSAPR also fixes 27 of the 79 vulnerabilities in VUL4J and resolves 164 out of 300 issues in SWE-Bench-Lite, demonstrating its broad effectiveness across different defect categories and real-world development scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Querying Labeled Time Series Data with Scenario Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10627v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation-based testing has become a crucial complement to road testing for ensuring the safety of cyber physical systems (CPS). As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Owlgorithm: Supporting Self-Regulated Learning in Competitive Programming through LLM-Driven Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09969v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Owlgorithm, an educational platform that supports Self-Regulated Learning (SRL) in competitive programming (CP) through AI-generated reflective questions. Leveraging GPT-4o, Owlgorithm produces context-aware, metacognitive prompts tailored to individual student submissions. Integrated into a second- and third-year CP course, the system-provided reflective prompts adapted to student outcomes: guiding deeper conceptual insight for correct solutions and structured debugging for partial or failed ones. Our exploratory assessment of student ratings and TA feedback revealed both promising benefits and notable limitations. While many found the generated questions useful for reflection and debugging, concerns were raised about feedback accuracy and classroom usability. These results suggest advantages of LLM-supported reflection for novice programmers, though refinements are needed to ensure reliability and pedagogical value for advanced learners. From our experience, several key insights emerged: GenAI can effectively support structured reflection, but careful prompt design, dynamic adaptation, and usability improvements are critical to realizing their potential in education. We offer specific recommendations for educators using similar tools and outline next steps to enhance Owlgorithm's educational impact. The underlying framework may also generalize to other reflective learning contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 figure, to be published in SIGCSE '26</p></details> |
| **[SPADA: A Spatial Dataflow Architecture Programming Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09447v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial dataflow architectures like the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine achieve exceptional performance in AI and scientific applications by leveraging distributed memory across processing elements (PEs) and localized computation. However, programming these architectures remains challenging due to the need for explicit orchestration of data movement through reconfigurable networks-on-chip and asynchronous computation triggered by data arrival. Existing FPGA and CGRA programming models emphasize loop scheduling but overlook the unique capabilities of spatial dataflow architectures, particularly efficient dataflow over regular grids and intricate routing management. We present SPADA, a programming language that provides precise control over data placement, dataflow patterns, and asynchronous operations while abstracting architecture-specific low-level details. We introduce a rigorous dataflow semantics framework for SPADA that defines routing correctness, data races, and deadlocks. Additionally, we design and implement a compiler targeting Cerebras CSL with multi-level lowering. SPADA serves as both a high-level programming interface and an intermediate representation for domain-specific languages (DSLs), which we demonstrate with the GT4Py stencil DSL. SPADA enables developers to express complex parallel patterns -- including pipelined reductions and multi-dimensional stencils -- in 6--8x less code than CSL with near-ideal weak scaling across three orders of magnitude. By unifying programming for spatial dataflow architectures under a single model, SPADA advances both the theoretical foundations and practical usability of these emerging high-performance computing platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Several Supporting Evidences for the Adaptive Feature Program](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09425v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Theoretically exploring the advantages of neural networks might be one of the most challenging problems in the AI era. An adaptive feature program has recently been proposed to analyze the feature learning characteristic property of neural networks in a more abstract way. Motivated by the celebrated Le Cam equivalence, we advocate the over-parametrized sequence models to further simplify the analysis of the training dynamics of adaptive feature program and present several supporting evidences for the adaptive feature program. More precisely, after having introduced the feature error measure (FEM) to characterize the quality of the learned feature, we show that the FEM is decreasing during the training process of several concrete adaptive feature models including linear regression, single/multiple index models, etc. We believe that this hints at the potential successes of the adaptive feature program.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming for d-dimensional Symbolic Regression Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09416v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP) is a semantic search approach that uses a pre-trained transformer model as a variation operator to generate offspring programs with controlled semantic similarity to a given parent. Unlike other semantic GP approaches that rely on fixed syntactic transformations, TSGP aims to learn diverse structural variations that lead to solutions with similar semantics. We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness. Thus, $\mathrm{SD}_t$ provides an effective mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ExDBN: Learning Dynamic Bayesian Networks using Extended Mixed-Integer Programming Formulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16100v3)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal learning from data has received much attention recently. Bayesian networks can be used to capture causal relationships. There, one recovers a weighted directed acyclic graph in which random variables are represented by vertices, and the weights associated with each edge represent the strengths of the causal relationships between them. This concept is extended to capture dynamic effects by introducing a dependency on past data, which may be captured by the structural equation model. This formalism is utilized in the present contribution to propose a score-based learning algorithm. A mixed-integer quadratic program is formulated and an algorithmic solution proposed, in which the pre-generation of exponentially many acyclicity constraints is avoided by utilizing the so-called branch-and-cut (``lazy constraint'') method. Comparing the novel approach to the state-of-the-art, we show that the proposed approach turns out to produce more accurate results when applied to small and medium-sized synthetic instances containing up to 80 time series. Lastly, two interesting applications in bioscience and finance, to which the method is directly applied, further stress the importance of developing highly accurate, globally convergent solvers that can handle instances of modest size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/pavelrt/ExDBN</p></details> |
| **[When AI Takes the Wheel: Security Analysis of Framework-Constrained Program Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16823v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the AI wave has grown rapidly in software development. Even novice developers can now design and generate complex framework-constrained software systems based on their high-level requirements with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, when LLMs gradually "take the wheel" of software development, developers may only check whether the program works. They often miss security problems hidden in how the generated programs are implemented. In this work, we investigate the security properties of framework-constrained programs generated by state-of-the-art LLMs. We focus specifically on Chrome extensions due to their complex security model involving multiple privilege boundaries and isolated components. To achieve this, we built ChromeSecBench, a dataset with 140 prompts based on known vulnerable extensions. We used these prompts to instruct nine state-of-the-art LLMs to generate complete Chrome extensions, and then analyzed them for vulnerabilities across three dimensions: scenario types, model differences, and vulnerability categories. Our results show that LLMs produced vulnerable programs at alarmingly high rates (18%-50%), particularly in Authentication & Identity and Cookie Management scenarios (up to 83% and 78% respectively). Most vulnerabilities exposed sensitive browser data like cookies, history, or bookmarks to untrusted code. Interestingly, we found that advanced reasoning models performed worse, generating more vulnerabilities than simpler models. These findings highlight a critical gap between LLMs' coding skills and their ability to write secure framework-constrained programs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attack-Centric by Design: A Program-Structure Taxonomy of Smart Contract Vulnerabilities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09051v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts concentrate high value assets and complex logic in small, immutable programs, where even minor bugs can cause major losses. Existing taxonomies and tools remain fragmented, organized around symptoms such as reentrancy rather than structural causes. This paper introduces an attack-centric, program-structure taxonomy that unifies Solidity vulnerabilities into eight root-cause families covering control flow, external calls, state integrity, arithmetic safety, environmental dependencies, access control, input validation, and cross-domain protocol assumptions. Each family is illustrated through concise Solidity examples, exploit mechanics, and mitigations, and linked to the detection signals observable by static, dynamic, and learning-based tools. We further cross-map legacy datasets (SmartBugs, SolidiFI) to this taxonomy to reveal label drift and coverage gaps. The taxonomy provides a consistent vocabulary and practical checklist that enable more interpretable detection, reproducible audits, and structured security education for both researchers and practitioners.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 1 figure, 8 root-cause families</p></details> |
| **[DeepProofLog: Efficient Proving in Deep Stochastic Logic Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08581v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neurosymbolic (NeSy) AI aims to combine the strengths of neural architectures and symbolic reasoning to improve the accuracy, interpretability, and generalization capability of AI models. While logic inference on top of subsymbolic modules has been shown to effectively guarantee these properties, this often comes at the cost of reduced scalability, which can severely limit the usability of NeSy models. This paper introduces DeepProofLog (DPrL), a novel NeSy system based on stochastic logic programs, which addresses the scalability limitations of previous methods. DPrL parameterizes all derivation steps with neural networks, allowing efficient neural guidance over the proving system. Additionally, we establish a formal mapping between the resolution process of our deep stochastic logic programs and Markov Decision Processes, enabling the application of dynamic programming and reinforcement learning techniques for efficient inference and learning. This theoretical connection improves scalability for complex proof spaces and large knowledge bases. Our experiments on standard NeSy benchmarks and knowledge graph reasoning tasks demonstrate that DPrL outperforms existing state-of-the-art NeSy systems, advancing scalability to larger and more complex settings than previously possible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Streaming Tensor Program: A streaming abstraction for dynamic parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07776v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic behaviors are becoming prevalent in many tensor applications. In machine learning, for example, the input tensors are dynamically shaped or ragged, and data-dependent control flow is widely used in many models. However, the limited expressiveness of prior programming abstractions for spatial dataflow accelerators forces the dynamic behaviors to be implemented statically or lacks the visibility for performance-critical decisions. To address these challenges, we present the Streaming Tensor Program (STeP), a new streaming abstraction that enables dynamic tensor workloads to run efficiently on spatial dataflow accelerators. STeP introduces flexible routing operators, an explicit memory hierarchy, and symbolic shape semantics that expose dynamic data rates and tensor dimensions. These capabilities unlock new optimizations-dynamic tiling, dynamic parallelization, and configuration time-multiplexing-that adapt to dynamic behaviors while preserving dataflow efficiency. Using a cycle-approximate simulator on representative LLM layers with real-world traces, dynamic tiling reduces on-chip memory requirement by 2.18x, dynamic parallelization improves latency by 1.5x, and configuration time-multiplexing improves compute utilization by 2.57x over implementations available in prior abstractions.</p></details> |  |
