| **[Towards the Automated Extraction and Refactoring of NoSQL Schemas from Application Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20230v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a static code analysis strategy to extract logical schemas from NoSQL applications. Our solution is based on a model-driven reverse engineering process composed of a chain of platform-independent model transformations. The extracted schema conforms to the \uschema{} unified metamodel, which can represent both NoSQL and relational schemas. To support this process, we define a metamodel capable of representing the core elements of object-oriented languages. Application code is first injected into a code model, from which a control flow model is derived. This, in turn, enables the generation of a model representing both data access operations and the structure of stored data. From these models, the \uschema{} logical schema is inferred. Additionally, the extracted information can be used to identify refactoring opportunities. We illustrate this capability through the detection of join-like query patterns and the automated application of field duplication strategies to eliminate expensive joins. All stages of the process are described in detail, and the approach is validated through a round-trip experiment in which a application using a MongoDB store is automatically generated from a predefined schema. The inferred schema is then compared to the original to assess the accuracy of the extraction process.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Journal Systems and Software, 23 pages</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Large Language Models for Code Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20206v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Code reviews are crucial for software quality. Recent AI advances have allowed large language models (LLMs) to review and fix code; now, there are tools that perform these reviews. However, their reliability and accuracy have not yet been systematically evaluated. Objective: This study compares different LLMs' performance in detecting code correctness and suggesting improvements. Method: We tested GPT4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash on 492 AI generated code blocks of varying correctness, along with 164 canonical code blocks from the HumanEval benchmark. To simulate the code review task objectively, we expected LLMs to assess code correctness and improve the code if needed. We ran experiments with different configurations and reported on the results. Results: With problem descriptions, GPT4o and Gemini 2.0 Flash correctly classified code correctness 68.50% and 63.89% of the time, respectively, and corrected the code 67.83% and 54.26% of the time for the 492 code blocks of varying correctness. Without problem descriptions, performance declined. The results for the 164 canonical code blocks differed, suggesting that performance depends on the type of code. Conclusion: LLM code reviews can help suggest improvements and assess correctness, but there is a risk of faulty outputs. We propose a process that involves humans, called the "Human in the loop LLM Code Review" to promote knowledge sharing while mitigating the risk of faulty outputs.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study on Strong-Weak Model Collaboration for Repo-level Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20182v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study cost-efficient collaboration between strong and weak language models for repository-level code generation, where the weak model handles simpler tasks at lower cost, and the most challenging tasks are delegated to the strong model. While many works propose architectures for this task, few analyze performance relative to cost. We evaluate a broad spectrum of collaboration strategies: context-based, pipeline-based, and dynamic, on GitHub issue resolution. Our most effective collaborative strategy achieves equivalent performance to the strong model while reducing the cost by 40%. Based on our findings, we offer actionable guidelines for choosing collaboration strategies under varying budget and performance constraints. Our results show that strong-weak collaboration substantially boosts the weak model's performance at a fraction of the cost, pipeline and context-based methods being most efficient. We release the code for our work at https://github.com/shubhamrgandhi/codegen-strong-weak-collab.</p></details> |  |
| **[Error Optimization: Overcoming Exponential Signal Decay in Deep Predictive Coding Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20137v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive Coding (PC) offers a biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation for neural network training, yet struggles with deeper architectures. This paper identifies the root cause: an inherent signal decay problem where gradients attenuate exponentially with depth, becoming computationally negligible due to numerical precision constraints. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce Error Optimization (EO), a novel reparameterization that preserves PC's theoretical properties while eliminating signal decay. By optimizing over prediction errors rather than states, EO enables signals to reach all layers simultaneously and without attenuation, converging orders of magnitude faster than standard PC. Experiments across multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate that EO matches backpropagation's performance even for deeper models where conventional PC struggles. Besides practical improvements, our work provides theoretical insight into PC dynamics and establishes a foundation for scaling biologically-inspired learning to deeper architectures on digital hardware and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>All c...</summary><p>All code available at https://github.com/cgoemaere/pc_error_optimization</p></details> |
| **[On the class of coding optimality of human languages and the origins of Zipf's law](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.20015v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Here we present a new class of optimality for coding systems. Members of that class are separated linearly from optimal coding and thus exhibit Zipf's law, namely a power-law distribution of frequency ranks. Whithin that class, Zipf's law, the size-rank law and the size-probability law form a group-like structure. We identify human languages that are members of the class. All languages showing sufficient agreement with Zipf's law are potential members of the class. In contrast, there are communication systems in other species that cannot be members of that class for exhibiting an exponential distribution instead but dolphins and humpback whales might. We provide a new insight into plots of frequency versus rank in double logarithmic scale. For any system, a straight line in that scale indicates that the lengths of optimal codes under non-singular coding and under uniquely decodable encoding are separated by a linear function whose slope is the exponent of Zipf's law. For systems under compression and constrained to be uniquely decodable, such a straight line may indicate that the system is coding close to optimality. Our findings provide support for the hypothesis that Zipf's law originates from compression.</p></details> |  |
| **[Which Data Attributes Stimulate Math and Code Reasoning? An Investigation via Influence Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19949v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable reasoning capabilities in math and coding, often bolstered by post-training on the chain-of-thoughts (CoTs) generated by stronger models. However, existing strategies for curating such training data predominantly rely on heuristics, limiting generalizability and failing to capture subtleties underlying in data. To address these limitations, we leverage influence functions to systematically attribute LLMs' reasoning ability on math and coding to individual training examples, sequences, and tokens, enabling deeper insights into effective data characteristics. Our Influence-based Reasoning Attribution (Infra) uncovers nontrivial cross-domain effects across math and coding tasks: high-difficulty math examples improve both math and code reasoning, while low-difficulty code tasks most effectively benefit code reasoning. Based on these findings, we introduce a simple yet effective dataset reweighting strategy by flipping task difficulty, which doubles AIME24 accuracy from 10\% to 20\% and boosts LiveCodeBench accuracy from 33.8\% to 35.3\% for Qwen2.5-7B-Instruct. Moreover, our fine-grained attribution reveals that the sequence-level exploratory behaviors enhance reasoning performance in both math and code, and the token-level influence patterns are distinct for math and code reasoning: the former prefers natural language logic connectors and the latter emphasizes structural syntax.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Invisible Hand: Unveiling Provider Bias in Large Language Models for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07849v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as the new recommendation engines, surpassing traditional methods in both capability and scope, particularly in code generation. In this paper, we reveal a novel provider bias in LLMs: without explicit directives, these models show systematic preferences for services from specific providers in their recommendations (e.g., favoring Google Cloud over Microsoft Azure). To systematically investigate this bias, we develop an automated pipeline to construct the dataset, incorporating 6 distinct coding task categories and 30 real-world application scenarios. Leveraging this dataset, we conduct the first comprehensive empirical study of provider bias in LLM code generation across seven state-of-the-art LLMs, utilizing approximately 500 million tokens (equivalent to $5,000+ in computational costs). Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit significant provider preferences, predominantly favoring services from Google and Amazon, and can autonomously modify input code to incorporate their preferred providers without users' requests. Such a bias holds far-reaching implications for market dynamics and societal equilibrium, potentially contributing to digital monopolies. It may also deceive users and violate their expectations, leading to various consequences. We call on the academic community to recognize this emerging issue and develop effective evaluation and mitigation methods to uphold AI security and fairness.</p></details> | 27 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Deconstructing Obfuscation: A four-dimensional framework for evaluating Large Language Models assembly code deobfuscation capabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19887v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in software engineering, yet their effectiveness for binary analysis remains unexplored. We present the first comprehensive evaluation of commercial LLMs for assembly code deobfuscation. Testing seven state-of-the-art models against four obfuscation scenarios (bogus control flow, instruction substitution, control flow flattening, and their combination), we found striking performance variations--from autonomous deobfuscation to complete failure. We propose a theoretical framework based on four dimensions: Reasoning Depth, Pattern Recognition, Noise Filtering, and Context Integration, explaining these variations. Our analysis identifies five error patterns: predicate misinterpretation, structural mapping errors, control flow misinterpretation, arithmetic transformation errors, and constant propagation errors, revealing fundamental limitations in LLM code processing.We establish a three-tier resistance model: bogus control flow (low resistance), control flow flattening (moderate resistance), and instruction substitution/combined techniques (high resistance). Universal failure against combined techniques demonstrates that sophisticated obfuscation remains effective against advanced LLMs. Our findings suggest a human-AI collaboration paradigm where LLMs reduce expertise barriers for certain reverse engineering tasks while requiring human guidance for complex deobfuscation. This work provides a foundation for evaluating emerging capabilities and developing resistant obfuscation techniques.x deobfuscation.

| **[The Entropy Characterization of Quantum MDS Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19826v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An $[[n,k,d]]$ quantum maximum-distance-separable code maps $k$ source qudits to $n$ coded qudits such that any $n-(d-1)$ coded qudits may recover all source qudits and $n = k + 2 (d-1)$. The entropy of the joint state of the reference system of $k$ qudits and the $n$ coded qudits is fully characterized - the joint state must be pure, i.e., has entropy zero; and any sub-system whose number of qudits is at most half of $k+n$, the total number of qudits in the joint state must be maximally mixed, i.e., has entropy equal to its size.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compliance-to-Code: Enhancing Financial Compliance Checking via Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19804v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, regulatory compliance has become a cornerstone of corporate governance, ensuring adherence to systematic legal frameworks. At its core, financial regulations often comprise highly intricate provisions, layered logical structures, and numerous exceptions, which inevitably result in labor-intensive or comprehension challenges. To mitigate this, recent Regulatory Technology (RegTech) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in automating the conversion of regulatory text into executable compliance logic. However, their performance remains suboptimal particularly when applied to Chinese-language financial regulations, due to three key limitations: (1) incomplete domain-specific knowledge representation, (2) insufficient hierarchical reasoning capabilities, and (3) failure to maintain temporal and logical coherence. One promising solution is to develop a domain specific and code-oriented datasets for model training. Existing datasets such as LexGLUE, LegalBench, and CODE-ACCORD are often English-focused, domain-mismatched, or lack fine-grained granularity for compliance code generation. To fill these gaps, we present Compliance-to-Code, the first large-scale Chinese dataset dedicated to financial regulatory compliance. Covering 1,159 annotated clauses from 361 regulations across ten categories, each clause is modularly structured with four logical elements-subject, condition, constraint, and contextual information-along with regulation relations. We provide deterministic Python code mappings, detailed code reasoning, and code explanations to facilitate automated auditing. To demonstrate utility, we present FinCheck: a pipeline for regulation structuring, code generation, and report generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[CIDRe: A Reference-Free Multi-Aspect Criterion for Code Comment Quality Measurement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19757v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective generation of structured code comments requires robust quality metrics for dataset curation, yet existing approaches (SIDE, MIDQ, STASIS) suffer from limited code-comment analysis. We propose CIDRe, a language-agnostic reference-free quality criterion combining four synergistic aspects: (1) relevance (code-comment semantic alignment), (2) informativeness (functional coverage), (3) completeness (presence of all structure sections), and (4) description length (detail sufficiency). We validate our criterion on a manually annotated dataset. Experiments demonstrate CIDRe's superiority over existing metrics, achieving improvement in cross-entropy evaluation. When applied to filter comments, the models finetuned on CIDRe-filtered data show statistically significant quality gains in GPT-4o-mini assessments.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReChisel: Effective Automatic Chisel Code Generation by LLM with Reflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19734v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coding with hardware description languages (HDLs) such as Verilog is a time-intensive and laborious task. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing interest in applying LLMs to assist with HDL coding. Recent efforts have demonstrated the potential of LLMs in translating natural language to traditional HDL Verilog. Chisel, a next-generation HDL based on Scala, introduces higher-level abstractions, facilitating more concise, maintainable, and scalable hardware designs. However, the potential of using LLMs for Chisel code generation remains largely unexplored. This work proposes ReChisel, an LLM-based agentic system designed to enhance the effectiveness of Chisel code generation. ReChisel incorporates a reflection mechanism to iteratively refine the quality of generated code using feedback from compilation and simulation processes, and introduces an escape mechanism to break free from non-progress loops. Experiments demonstrate that ReChisel significantly improves the success rate of Chisel code generation, achieving performance comparable to state-of-the-art LLM-based agentic systems for Verilog code generation.</p></details> | Accepted to DAC 2025 |
| **[Separate Source Channel Coding Is Still What You Need: An LLM-based Rethinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04285v4)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Along with the proliferating research interest in Semantic Communication (SemCom), Joint Source Channel Coding (JSCC) has dominated the attention due to the widely assumed existence in efficiently delivering information semantics. Nevertheless, this paper challenges the conventional JSCC paradigm, and advocates for adoption of Separate Source Channel Coding (SSCC) to enjoy the underlying more degree of freedom for optimization. We demonstrate that SSCC, after leveraging the strengths of Large Language Model (LLM) for source coding and Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT) complemented for channel decoding, offers superior performance over JSCC. Our proposed framework also effectively highlights the compatibility challenges between SemCom approaches and digital communication systems, particularly concerning the resource costs associated with the transmission of high precision floating point numbers. Through comprehensive evaluations, we establish that empowered by LLM-based compression and ECCT-enhanced error correction, SSCC remains a viable and effective solution for modern communication systems. In other words, separate source and channel coding is still what we need!</p></details> |  |
| **[Conditioning LLMs to Generate Code-Switched Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12924v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code-switching (CS) is still a critical challenge in Natural Language Processing (NLP). Current Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle to interpret and generate code-switched text, primarily due to the scarcity of large-scale CS datasets for training. This paper presents a novel methodology to generate CS data using LLMs, and test it on the English-Spanish language pair. We propose back-translating natural CS sentences into monolingual English, and using the resulting parallel corpus to fine-tune LLMs to turn monolingual sentences into CS. Unlike previous approaches to CS generation, our methodology uses natural CS data as a starting point, allowing models to learn its natural distribution beyond grammatical patterns. We thoroughly analyse the models' performance through a study on human preferences, a qualitative error analysis and an evaluation with popular automatic metrics. Results show that our methodology generates fluent code-switched text, expanding research opportunities in CS communication, and that traditional metrics do not correlate with human judgement when assessing the quality of the generated CS data. We release our code and generated dataset under a CC-BY-NC-SA license.</p></details> | <details><summary>[v2]A...</summary><p>[v2]Added new experiments and analyses</p></details> |

When considering its potential use for ADAS or AD systems in the automotive context, there is a need to systematically assess this new setup: LLMs entail a well-documented set of risks for safety-related systems' development due to their stochastic nature. To reduce the effort for code reviewers to evaluate LLM-generated code, we propose an evaluation pipeline to conduct sanity-checks on the generated code. We compare the performance of six state-of-the-art LLMs (CodeLlama, CodeGemma, DeepSeek-r1, DeepSeek-Coders, Mistral, and GPT-4) on four safety-related programming tasks. Additionally, we qualitatively analyse the most frequent faults generated by these LLMs, creating a failure-mode catalogue to support human reviewers. Finally, the limitations and capabilities of LLMs in code generation, and the use of the proposed pipeline in the existing process, are discussed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 44th International Conference on Computer Safety, Reliability and Security (SafeComp 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Bridging Textual-Collaborative Gap through Semantic Codes for Sequential Recommendation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12183v2)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, substantial research efforts have been devoted to enhancing sequential recommender systems by integrating abundant side information with ID-based collaborative information. This study specifically focuses on leveraging the textual metadata (e.g., titles and brands) associated with items. While existing methods have achieved notable success by combining text and ID representations, they often struggle to strike a balance between textual information embedded in text representations and collaborative information from sequential patterns of user behavior. In light of this, we propose CCFRec, a novel Code-based textual and Collaborative semantic Fusion method for sequential Recommendation. The key idea behind our approach is to bridge the gap between textual and collaborative information using semantic codes. Specifically, we generate fine-grained semantic codes from multi-view text embeddings through vector quantization techniques. Subsequently, we develop a code-guided semantic-fusion module based on the cross-attention mechanism to flexibly extract and integrate relevant information from text representations. In order to further enhance the fusion of textual and collaborative semantics, we introduce an optimization strategy that employs code masking with two specific objectives: masked code modeling and masked sequence alignment. The merit of these objectives lies in leveraging mask prediction tasks and augmented item representations to capture code correlations within individual items and enhance the sequence modeling of the recommendation backbone. Extensive experiments conducted on four public datasets demonstrate the superiority of CCFRec, showing significant improvements over various sequential recommendation models. Our code is available at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/CCFRec.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD 2025 Research Track</p></details> |
| **[CODE-DITING: A Reasoning-Based Metric for Functional Alignment in Code Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19502v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trustworthy evaluation methods for code snippets play a crucial role in neural code generation. Traditional methods, which either rely on reference solutions or require executable test cases, have inherent limitation in flexibility and scalability. The recent LLM-as-Judge methodology offers a promising alternative by directly evaluating functional consistency between the problem description and the generated code. To systematically understand the landscape of these LLM-as-Judge methods, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study across three diverse datasets. Our investigation reveals the pros and cons of two categories of LLM-as-Judge methods: the methods based on general foundation models can achieve good performance but require complex prompts and lack explainability, while the methods based on reasoning foundation models provide better explainability with simpler prompts but demand substantial computational resources due to their large parameter sizes. To address these limitations, we propose CODE-DITING, a novel code evaluation method that balances accuracy, efficiency and explainability. We develop a data distillation framework that effectively transfers reasoning capabilities from DeepSeek-R1671B to our CODE-DITING 1.5B and 7B models, significantly enhancing evaluation explainability and reducing the computational cost. With the majority vote strategy in the inference process, CODE-DITING 1.5B outperforms all models with the same magnitude of parameters and achieves performance which would normally exhibit in a model with 5 times of parameter scale. CODE-DITING 7B surpasses GPT-4o and DeepSeek-V3 671B, even though it only uses 1% of the parameter volume of these large models. Further experiments show that CODEDITING is robust to preference leakage and can serve as a promising alternative for code evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Residual Cross-Attention Transformer-Based Multi-User CSI Feedback with Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19465v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This letter proposes a deep-learning (DL)-based multi-user channel state information (CSI) feedback framework for massive multiple-input multiple-output systems, where the deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) is utilized to improve the CSI reconstruction accuracy. Specifically, we design a multi-user joint CSI feedback framework, whereby the CSI correlation of nearby users is utilized to reduce the feedback overhead. Under the framework, we propose a new residual cross-attention transformer architecture, which is deployed at the base station to further improve the CSI feedback performance. Moreover, to tackle the "cliff-effect" of conventional bit-level CSI feedback approaches, we integrated DJSCC into the multi-user CSI feedback, together with utilizing a two-stage training scheme to adapt to varying uplink noise levels. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our methods in CSI feedback performance, with low network complexity and better scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vibe Coding vs. Agentic Coding: Fundamentals and Practical Implications of Agentic AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19443v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This review presents a comprehensive analysis of two emerging paradigms in AI-assisted software development: vibe coding and agentic coding. While both leverage large language models (LLMs), they differ fundamentally in autonomy, architectural design, and the role of the developer. Vibe coding emphasizes intuitive, human-in-the-loop interaction through prompt-based, conversational workflows that support ideation, experimentation, and creative exploration. In contrast, agentic coding enables autonomous software development through goal-driven agents capable of planning, executing, testing, and iterating tasks with minimal human intervention. We propose a detailed taxonomy spanning conceptual foundations, execution models, feedback loops, safety mechanisms, debugging strategies, and real-world tool ecosystems. Through comparative workflow analysis and 20 detailed use cases, we illustrate how vibe systems thrive in early-stage prototyping and education, while agentic systems excel in enterprise-grade automation, codebase refactoring, and CI/CD integration. We further examine emerging trends in hybrid architectures, where natural language interfaces are coupled with autonomous execution pipelines. Finally, we articulate a future roadmap for agentic AI, outlining the infrastructure needed for trustworthy, explainable, and collaborative systems. Our findings suggest that successful AI software engineering will rely not on choosing one paradigm, but on harmonizing their strengths within a unified, human-centered development lifecycle.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 Pa...</summary><p>35 Pages, 8 Figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |

We propose a two-stage training framework combining contrastive learning and conditional decoding to enable flexible style control. The first stage aligns code style representations with semantic and structural features. In the second stage, we fine-tune a language model (e.g., Flan-T5) conditioned on the learned style vector to guide generation. Our method supports style interpolation and user personalization via lightweight mixing. Compared to prior work, our unified framework offers improved stylistic control without sacrificing code correctness. This is among the first approaches to combine contrastive alignment with conditional decoding for style-guided code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, submitted to EMNLP 2025 (Industry Track)</p></details> |
| **[Simple and Effective Baselines for Code Summarisation Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19392v1)** | 2025-05-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code documentation is useful, but writing it is time-consuming. Different techniques for generating code summaries have emerged, but comparing them is difficult because human evaluation is expensive and automatic metrics are unreliable. In this paper, we introduce a simple new baseline in which we ask an LLM to give an overall score to a summary. Unlike n-gram and embedding-based baselines, our approach is able to consider the code when giving a score. This allows us to also make a variant that does not consider the reference summary at all, which could be used for other tasks, e.g., to evaluate the quality of documentation in code bases. We find that our method is as good or better than prior metrics, though we recommend using it in conjunction with embedding-based methods to avoid the risk of LLM-specific bias.</p></details> |  |
| **[Architectures of Error: A Philosophical Inquiry into AI and Human Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19353v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rise of generative AI (GenAI), Large Language Models are increasingly employed for code generation, becoming active co-authors alongside human programmers. Focusing specifically on this application domain, this paper articulates distinct ``Architectures of Error'' to ground an epistemic distinction between human and machine code generation. Examined through their shared vulnerability to error, this distinction reveals fundamentally different causal origins: human-cognitive versus artificial-stochastic. To develop this framework and substantiate the distinction, the analysis draws critically upon Dennett's mechanistic functionalism and Rescher's methodological pragmatism. I argue that a systematic differentiation of these error profiles raises critical philosophical questions concerning semantic coherence, security robustness, epistemic limits, and control mechanisms in human-AI collaborative software development. The paper also utilizes Floridi's levels of abstraction to provide a nuanced understanding of how these error dimensions interact and may evolve with technological advancements. This analysis aims to offer philosophers a structured framework for understanding GenAI's unique epistemological challenges, shaped by these architectural foundations, while also providing software engineers a basis for more critically informed engagement.</p></details> | preprint |
| **[VerifyThisBench: Generating Code, Specifications, and Proofs All at Once](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19271v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in code generation, but many existing benchmarks are approaching saturation and offer little guarantee on the trustworthiness of the generated programs, offering limited insight into deeper reasoning capabilities. We introduce VerifyThisBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on end-to-end program verification tasks that require interpreting natural language problem descriptions, formulating formal specifications, generating code, and constructing correctness proofs. Our evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, such as o3-mini, achieve a pass rate of less than 4%, with many outputs failing to compile. To reduce task complexity, we further propose VerifyThisBenchXS, a variant in which partial implementations or proofs are provided. We systematically assess SOTA models on both benchmarks, uncovering key strengths and limitations in their formal reasoning and verification capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Transformer-based World Models with Contrastive Predictive Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04416v2)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The DreamerV3 algorithm recently obtained remarkable performance across diverse environment domains by learning an accurate world model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Following the success of model-based reinforcement learning algorithms and the rapid adoption of the Transformer architecture for its superior training efficiency and favorable scaling properties, recent works such as STORM have proposed replacing RNN-based world models with Transformer-based world models using masked self-attention. However, despite the improved training efficiency of these methods, their impact on performance remains limited compared to the Dreamer algorithm, struggling to learn competitive Transformer-based world models. In this work, we show that the next state prediction objective adopted in previous approaches is insufficient to fully exploit the representation capabilities of Transformers. We propose to extend world model predictions to longer time horizons by introducing TWISTER (Transformer-based World model wIth contraSTivE Representations), a world model using action-conditioned Contrastive Predictive Coding to learn high-level temporal feature representations and improve the agent performance. TWISTER achieves a human-normalized mean score of 162% on the Atari 100k benchmark, setting a new record among state-of-the-art methods that do not employ look-ahead search.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLEVER: A Curated Benchmark for Formally Verified Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13938v3)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$, a high-quality, curated benchmark of 161 problems for end-to-end verified code generation in Lean. Each problem consists of (1) the task of generating a specification that matches a held-out ground-truth specification, and (2) the task of generating a Lean implementation that provably satisfies this specification. Unlike prior benchmarks, ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$ avoids test-case supervision, LLM-generated annotations, and specifications that leak implementation logic or allow vacuous solutions. All outputs are verified post-hoc using Lean's type checker to ensure machine-checkable correctness. We use ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$ to evaluate several few-shot and agentic approaches based on state-of-the-art language models.

| **[Is Compression Really Linear with Code Intelligence?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11441v2)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the relationship between data compression and the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial, especially in specialized domains like code intelligence. Prior work posited a linear relationship between compression and general intelligence. However, it overlooked the multifaceted nature of code that encompasses diverse programming languages and tasks, and struggled with fair evaluation of modern Code LLMs. We address this by evaluating a diverse array of open-source Code LLMs on comprehensive multi-language, multi-task code benchmarks. To address the challenge of efficient and fair evaluation of pre-trained LLMs' code intelligence, we introduce \textit{Format Annealing}, a lightweight, transparent training methodology designed to assess the intrinsic capabilities of these pre-trained models equitably. Compression efficacy, measured as bits-per-character (BPC), is determined using a novel, large-scale, and previously unseen code validation set derived from GitHub. Our empirical results reveal a fundamental logarithmic relationship between measured code intelligence and BPC. This finding refines prior hypotheses of linearity, which we suggest are likely observations of the logarithmic curve's tail under specific, limited conditions. Our work provides a more nuanced understanding of compression's role in developing code intelligence and contributes a robust evaluation framework in the code domain.</p></details> | work in progress |

However, their capabilities in guiding users to solve complex real-world tasks remain underexplored. To address this limitation, in this work, we focus on coding tutoring, a challenging problem that requires tutors to proactively guide students towards completing predefined coding tasks. We propose a novel agent workflow, Trace-and-Verify (TRAVER), which combines knowledge tracing to estimate a student's knowledge state and turn-by-turn verification to ensure effective guidance toward task completion. We introduce DICT, an automatic evaluation protocol that assesses tutor agents using controlled student simulation and code generation tests. Extensive experiments reveal the challenges of coding tutoring and demonstrate that TRAVER achieves a significantly higher success rate. Although we use code tutoring as an example in this paper, our approach can be extended beyond coding, providing valuable insights into advancing tutoring agents for human task learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Findings of ACL 2025</p></details> |

Therefore, determining whether a piece of code is written by a human or generated by an artificial intelligence (AI) model is a critical issue. In this study, we present AIGCodeSet, which consists of 2.828 AI-generated and 4.755 human-written Python codes, created using CodeLlama 34B, Codestral 22B, and Gemini 1.5 Flash. In addition, we share the results of our experiments conducted with baseline detection methods. Our experiments show that a Bayesian classifier outperforms the other models.</p></details> |  |

A Qualitative Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14341v4)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many toolkit developers seek to streamline the visualization programming process for their users through structured support such as prescribed templates and example galleries. However, few projects examine how users organize their own visualization programs, how their coding choices may deviate from the intents of toolkit developers, and how these differences may impact visualization prototyping and design. Further, is it possible to infer users' reasoning indirectly through their code, even when users copy code from other sources? Understanding these patterns can reveal opportunities to align toolkit design with actual user behavior, improving usability and supporting more flexible workflows. We explore this question through a qualitative analysis of 715 D3 programs on Observable. We identify three levels of program organization based on how users decompose their code into smaller blocks: Program-, Chart-, and Component-Level code decomposition, with a strong preference for Component-Level reasoning. In a series of interviews, we corroborate that these levels reflect how Observable users reason about visualization programs. We compare common user-made components with those theorized in the Grammar of Graphics to assess overlap in user and toolkit developer reasoning. We find that, while the Grammar of Graphics covers basic visualizations well, it falls short in describing complex visualization types, especially those with animation, interaction, and parameterization components. Our findings highlight how user practices differ from formal grammars and suggest opportunities for rethinking visualization toolkit support, including augmenting learning tools and AI assistants to better reflect real-world coding strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Language Models Surface the Unwritten Code of Science and Society](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18942v1)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper calls on the research community not only to investigate how human biases are inherited by large language models (LLMs) but also to explore how these biases in LLMs can be leveraged to make society's "unwritten code" - such as implicit stereotypes and heuristics - visible and accessible for critique. We introduce a conceptual framework through a case study in science: uncovering hidden rules in peer review - the factors that reviewers care about but rarely state explicitly due to normative scientific expectations. The idea of the framework is to push LLMs to speak out their heuristics through generating self-consistent hypotheses - why one paper appeared stronger in reviewer scoring - among paired papers submitted to 45 computer science conferences, while iteratively searching deeper hypotheses from remaining pairs where existing hypotheses cannot explain. We observed that LLMs' normative priors about the internal characteristics of good science extracted from their self-talk, e.g. theoretical rigor, were systematically updated toward posteriors that emphasize storytelling about external connections, such as how the work is positioned and connected within and across literatures. This shift reveals the primacy of scientific myths about intrinsic properties driving scientific excellence rather than extrinsic contextualization and storytelling that influence conceptions of relevance and significance. Human reviewers tend to explicitly reward aspects that moderately align with LLMs' normative priors (correlation = 0.49) but avoid articulating contextualization and storytelling posteriors in their review comments (correlation = -0.14), despite giving implicit reward to them with positive scores. We discuss the broad applicability of the framework, leveraging LLMs as diagnostic tools to surface the tacit codes underlying human society, enabling more precisely targeted responsible AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Output to Evaluation: Does Raw Instruction-Tuned Code LLMs Output Suffice for Fill-in-the-Middle Code Generation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18789v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-processing is crucial for the automatic evaluation of LLMs in fill-in-the-middle (FIM) code generation due to the frequent presence of extraneous code in raw outputs. This extraneous generation suggests a lack of awareness regarding output boundaries, requiring truncation for effective evaluation. The determination of an optimal truncation strategy, however, often proves intricate, particularly when the scope includes several programming languages. This study investigates the necessity of post-processing instruction-tuned LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that supervised fine-tuning significantly enhances FIM code generation, enabling LLMs to generate code that seamlessly integrates with the surrounding context. Evaluating our fine-tuned \texttt{Qwen2.5-Coder} (base and instruct) models on HumanEval Infilling and SAFIM benchmarks demonstrates improved performances without post-processing, especially when the \emph{middle} consist of complete lines. However, post-processing of the LLM outputs remains necessary when the \emph{middle} is a random span of code.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Compression algorithms that reduce their size can mitigate these problems, provided that model performance stays close to the original. We propose a novel post-training compression framework that combines rate-aware quantization with entropy coding by (1) extending the well-known layer-wise loss by a quadratic rate estimation, and (2) providing locally exact solutions to this modified objective following the Optimal Brain Surgeon (OBS) method. Our method allows for very fast decoding and is compatible with arbitrary quantization grids. We verify our results empirically by testing on various computer-vision networks, achieving a 20-40\% decrease in bit rate at the same performance as the popular compression algorithm NNCodec.

However, translating these multimodal elements into executable code remains a challenging and time-consuming process that requires substantial ML expertise. We introduce ``Paper-to-Code'' (P2C), a novel task that transforms the multimodal content of scientific publications into fully executable code repositories, which extends beyond the existing formulation of code generation that merely converts textual descriptions into isolated code snippets. To automate the P2C process, we propose AutoP2C, a multi-agent framework based on large language models that processes both textual and visual content from research papers to generate complete code repositories. Specifically, AutoP2C contains four stages: (1) repository blueprint extraction from established codebases, (2) multimodal content parsing that integrates information from text, equations, and figures, (3) hierarchical task decomposition for structured code generation, and (4) iterative feedback-driven debugging to ensure functionality and performance. Evaluation on a benchmark of eight research papers demonstrates the effectiveness of AutoP2C, which can successfully generate executable code repositories for all eight papers, while OpenAI-o1 or DeepSeek-R1 can only produce runnable code for one paper. The code is available at https://github.com/shoushouyu/Automated-Paper-to-Code.</p></details> |  |
| **[A General Knowledge Injection Framework for ICD Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18708v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ICD Coding aims to assign a wide range of medical codes to a medical text document, which is a popular and challenging task in the healthcare domain. To alleviate the problems of long-tail distribution and the lack of annotations of code-specific evidence, many previous works have proposed incorporating code knowledge to improve coding performance. However, existing methods often focus on a single type of knowledge and design specialized modules that are complex and incompatible with each other, thereby limiting their scalability and effectiveness. To address this issue, we propose GKI-ICD, a novel, general knowledge injection framework that integrates three key types of knowledge, namely ICD Description, ICD Synonym, and ICD Hierarchy, without specialized design of additional modules. The comprehensive utilization of the above knowledge, which exhibits both differences and complementarity, can effectively enhance the ICD coding performance. Extensive experiments on existing popular ICD coding benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of GKI-ICD, which achieves the state-of-the-art performance on most evaluation metrics.

Our main contribution is an explicit upper bound on the probability of incorrect decoding, using the RPA decoder, over a binary symmetric channel (BSC). Importantly, we focus on the events where a \emph{single} iteration of the RPA decoder, in each recursive call, is sufficient for convergence. Key components of our analysis are explicit estimates of the probability of incorrect decoding of first-order RM codes using a maximum likelihood (ML) decoder, and estimates of the error probabilities during the aggregation phase of the RPA decoder. Our results allow us to show that for RM codes with blocklength $N = 2^m$, the RPA decoder can achieve vanishing error probabilities, in the large blocklength limit, for RM orders that grow roughly logarithmically in $m$.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 2 figures, submitted to the IEEE</p></details> |

To enable LLMs to address more complex coding challenges, existing research has focused on crafting multi-agent systems with agentic workflows, where complex coding tasks are decomposed into sub-tasks, assigned to specialized agents. Despite their effectiveness, current approaches heavily rely on hand-crafted agentic workflows, with both agent topologies and prompts manually designed, which limits their ability to automatically adapt to different types of coding problems. To address these limitations and enable automated workflow design, we propose \textbf{S}elf-\textbf{E}volving \textbf{W}orkflow (\textbf{SEW}), a novel self-evolving framework that automatically generates and optimises multi-agent workflows. Extensive experiments on three coding benchmark datasets, including the challenging LiveCodeBench, demonstrate that our SEW can automatically design agentic workflows and optimise them through self-evolution, bringing up to 33\% improvement on LiveCodeBench compared to using the backbone LLM only. Furthermore, by investigating different representation schemes of workflow, we provide insights into the optimal way to encode workflow information with text.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |

However, current semantic communication systems, which employ neural coding for feature extraction from raw data, have not adequately addressed the fundamental question: Is general feature extraction through deep neural networks sufficient for understanding semantic meaning within raw data in semantic communication? This article is thus motivated to clarify two critical aspects: semantic understanding and general semantic representation. This article presents a standardized definition on semantic coding, an extensive neural coding scheme for general semantic representation that clearly represents underlying data semantics based on contextual modeling. With these general semantic representations obtained, both human- and machine-centric end-to-end data transmission can be achieved through only minimal specialized modifications, such as fine-tuning and regularization. This article contributes to establishing a commonsense that semantic communication extends far beyond mere feature transmission, focusing instead on conveying compact semantic representations through context-aware coding schemes.</p></details> |  |

However, even with significant efforts in building compilers, programming these tensor accelerators remains challenging, leaving much of their potential underutilized. Recently, large language models (LLMs), trained on large amounts of code, have shown significant promise in code generation and optimization tasks, but generating low-resource languages like specialized tensor accelerator code still poses a significant challenge. We tackle this challenge with Autocomp, an approach that empowers accelerator programmers to leverage domain knowledge and hardware feedback to optimize code via an automated LLM-driven search. We accomplish this by: 1) formulating each optimization pass as a structured two-phase prompt, divided into planning and code generation phases, 2) inserting domain knowledge during planning via a concise and adaptable optimization menu, and 3) integrating correctness and performance metrics from hardware as feedback at each search iteration. Across three categories of representative workloads and two different accelerators, we demonstrate that Autocomp-optimized code runs 5.6x (GEMM) and 2.7x (convolution) faster than the vendor-provided library, and outperforms expert-level hand-tuned code by 1.4x (GEMM), 1.1x (convolution), and 1.3x (fine-grained linear algebra). Additionally, we demonstrate that optimization schedules generated from Autocomp can be reused across similar tensor operations, improving speedups by up to 24% under a fixed sample budget.</p></details> |  |

Specialized agents (Reader, Searcher, Writer, Verifier, Orchestrator) then collaboratively generate documentation. We also propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework assessing Completeness, Helpfulness, and Truthfulness. Comprehensive experiments show DocAgent significantly outperforms baselines consistently.

However, crafting and tagging KCs to problems, traditionally performed by human domain experts, is highly labor-intensive. We present a fully automated, LLM-based pipeline for KC generation and tagging for open-ended programming problems. We also develop an LLM-based knowledge tracing (KT) framework to leverage these LLM-generated KCs, which we refer to as KCGen-KT. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on a real-world student code submission dataset. We find that KCGen-KT outperforms existing KT methods and human-written KCs on future student response prediction. We investigate the learning curves of generated KCs and show that LLM-generated KCs result in a better fit than human-written KCs under a cognitive model. We also conduct a human evaluation with course instructors to show that our pipeline generates reasonably accurate problem-KC mappings.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we take inspiration from recent work that suggests that models may follow instructions better when they are expressed in pseudo-code. However, writing pseudo-code programs can be tedious and using few-shot demonstrations to craft code representations for use in inference can be unnatural for non-expert users of LLMs. To overcome these limitations, we propose fine-tuning LLMs with instruction-tuning data that additionally includes instructions re-expressed in pseudo-code along with the final response. We evaluate models trained using our method on $11$ publicly available benchmarks comprising of tasks related to instruction-following, mathematics, and common-sense reasoning. We conduct rigorous experiments with $5$ different models and find that not only do models follow instructions better when trained with pseudo-code, they also retain their capabilities on the other tasks related to mathematical and common sense reasoning. Specifically, we observe a relative gain of $3$--$19$% on instruction-following benchmark, and an average gain of upto 14% across all tasks.</p></details> | Under Review |

These methods overlook repository context, real-world merge request evaluation, and defect detection, limiting their practicality. To address these issues, we explore the full automation pipeline within the online recommendation service of a company with nearly 400 million daily active users, analyzing industry-grade C++ codebases comprising hundreds of thousands of lines of code. We identify four key challenges: 1) capturing relevant context, 2) improving key bug inclusion (KBI), 3) reducing false alarm rates (FAR), and 4) integrating human workflows. To tackle these, we propose 1) code slicing algorithms for context extraction, 2) a multi-role LLM framework for KBI, 3) a filtering mechanism for FAR reduction, and 4) a novel prompt design for better human interaction. Our approach, validated on real-world merge requests from historical fault reports, achieves a 2x improvement over standard LLMs and a 10x gain over previous baselines. While the presented results focus on C++, the underlying framework design leverages language-agnostic principles (e.g., AST-based analysis), suggesting potential for broader applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Forty-Second International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025)</p></details> |

To further improve performance, we design a novel layer-wise masking strategy applied to each Mamba layer, allowing selective attention to relevant code features at different depths. Additionally, we introduce a progressive layer-wise loss, supervising the network at intermediate stages and promoting robust feature extraction throughout the decoding process. Comprehensive experiments across a range of linear codes demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms Transformer-only decoders and standard Mamba models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Function-Correcting $b$-symbol Codes for Locally $(λ, ρ,b)$-Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09473v2)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The family of functions plays a central role in the design and effectiveness of function-correcting codes. By focusing on a well-defined family of functions, function-correcting codes can be constructed with minimal length while still ensuring full error detection or correction within that family. In this work, we explore the concept of locally $(\lambda,\rho)$-functions for $b$-symbol read channels and investigate the redundancy of the corresponding function-correcting $b$-symbol codes(FCBSC) by introducing the notions of locally $(\lambda,\rho,b)$-functions. First, we discuss the possible values of $\lambda$ and $\rho$ for which any function can be considered as locally $(\lambda,\rho)$-function in $b$-symbol metric. The findings improve some known results in the Hamming metric and present several new results in the $b$-symbol metric. Then we investigate the redundancy of $(f,t)$-FCBSC for locally $(\lambda,\rho,b)$-functions. We establish a recurrence relation between the optimal redundancy of $(f,t)$ -function-correcting codes for the $(b+1)$-read and $b$-read channels. We establish an upper bound on the redundancy of $(f,t)$-function-correcting $b$-symbol codes for general locally ($\lambda,\rho$, $b$)-functions by linking it to the minimum achievable length of $b$-symbol error-correcting codes and traditional Hamming-metric codes, given a fixed number of codewords and a specified minimum distance. We derive some explicit upper bounds on the redundancy of $(f,t)$-function-correcting $b$-symbol codes for $\rho=2t$. Moreover, for the case where $b=1$, we show that a locally ($3,2t,1$)-function achieves the optimal redundancy of $3t$. Additionally, we explicitly investigate locality and redundancy for the $b$-symbol weight distribution function for $b\geq1$.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a novel feature tree-based synthesis framework, which revolves around hierarchical code features derived from high-level abstractions of code. The feature tree is constructed from raw data and refined iteratively to increase the quantity and diversity of the extracted features, which captures and recognizes more complex patterns and relationships within the code. By adjusting the depth and breadth of the sampled subtrees, our framework provides precise control over the complexity of the generated code, enabling functionalities that range from function-level operations to multi-file scenarios. We fine-tuned widely-used base models to obtain EpiCoder series, achieving state-of-the-art performance on multiple benchmarks at both the function and file levels. In particular, empirical evidence indicates that our approach shows significant potential in the synthesizing of repository-level code data.

However, most existing DUNs solely rely on the image-domain unfolding, which restricts the information transmission capacity and reconstruction flexibility, leading to their loss of image details and unsatisfactory performance. To overcome these limitations, this paper develops a dual-domain optimization framework that combines the priors of (1) image- and (2) convolutional-coding-domains and offers generality to CS and other inverse imaging tasks. By converting this optimization framework into deep NN structures, we present a Dual-Domain Deep Convolutional Coding Network (D3C2-Net), which enjoys the ability to efficiently transmit high-capacity self-adaptive convolutional features across all its unfolded stages. Our theoretical analyses and experiments on simulated and real captured data, covering 2D and 3D natural, medical, and scientific signals, demonstrate the effectiveness, practicality, superior performance, and generalization ability of our method over other competing approaches and its significant potential in achieving a balance among accuracy, complexity, and interpretability.

Recently, the rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made it possible to generate front-end Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) code directly from webpage designs. However, real-world webpages encompass not only a diverse array of HTML tags but also complex stylesheets, resulting in significantly lengthy code. The lengthy code poses challenges for the performance and efficiency of MLLMs, especially in capturing the structural information of UI designs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes UICopilot, a novel approach to automating UI synthesis via hierarchical code generation from webpage designs. The core idea of UICopilot is to decompose the generation process into two stages: first, generating the coarse-grained HTML hierarchical structure, followed by the generation of fine-grained code. To validate the effectiveness of UICopilot, we conduct experiments on a real-world dataset, i.e., WebCode2M. Experimental results demonstrate that UICopilot significantly outperforms existing baselines in both automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluations. Specifically, statistical analysis reveals that the majority of human annotators prefer the webpages generated by UICopilot over those produced by GPT-4V.</p></details> | WWW' 2025 |
| **[Distilling LLM Agent into Small Models with Retrieval and Code Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17612v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but remain computationally expensive, limiting their practical deployment. To address this, recent works have focused on distilling reasoning capabilities into smaller language models (sLMs) using chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from teacher LLMs. However, this approach struggles in scenarios requiring rare factual knowledge or precise computation, where sLMs often hallucinate due to limited capability. In this work, we propose Agent Distillation, a framework for transferring not only reasoning capability but full task-solving behavior from LLM-based agents into sLMs with retrieval and code tools. We improve agent distillation along two complementary axes: (1) we introduce a prompting method called first-thought prefix to enhance the quality of teacher-generated trajectories; and (2) we propose a self-consistent action generation for improving test-time robustness of small agents. We evaluate our method on eight reasoning tasks across factual and mathematical domains, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Our results show that sLMs as small as 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B parameters can achieve performance competitive with next-tier larger 1.5B, 3B, 7B models fine-tuned using CoT distillation, demonstrating the potential of agent distillation for building practical, tool-using small agents.

| **[MARCO: Meta-Reflection with Cross-Referencing for Code Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17481v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The ability to reason is one of the most fundamental capabilities of large language models (LLMs), enabling a wide range of downstream tasks through sophisticated problem-solving. A critical aspect of this is code reasoning, which involves logical reasoning with formal languages (i.e., programming code). In this paper, we enhance this capability of LLMs by exploring the following question: how can an LLM agent become progressively smarter in code reasoning with each solution it proposes, thereby achieving substantial cumulative improvement? Most existing research takes a static perspective, focusing on isolated problem-solving using frozen LLMs. In contrast, we adopt a cognitive-evolving perspective and propose a novel framework named Meta-Reflection with Cross-Referencing (MARCO) that enables the LLM to evolve dynamically during inference through self-improvement. From the perspective of human cognitive development, we leverage both knowledge accumulation and lesson sharing. In particular, to accumulate knowledge during problem-solving, we propose meta-reflection that reflects on the reasoning paths of the current problem to obtain knowledge and experience for future consideration. Moreover, to effectively utilize the lessons from other agents, we propose cross-referencing that incorporates the solution and feedback from other agents into the current problem-solving process. We conduct experiments across various datasets in code reasoning, and the results demonstrate the effectiveness of MARCO.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Focus: Context Extraction for Efficient Code Vulnerability Detection with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17460v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models (LMs) show promise for vulnerability detection but struggle with long, real-world code due to sparse and uncertain vulnerability locations. These issues, exacerbated by token limits, often cause models to miss vulnerability-related signals, thereby impairing effective learning. A key intuition is to enhance LMs with concise, information-rich context. Commit-based annotations offer precise, CWE-agnostic supervision, but are unavailable during inference, as they depend on historical code changes. Moreover, their extreme sparsity, often covering only a few lines, makes it difficult for LMs to process directly. In this paper, we propose FocusVul, a model-agnostic framework that improves LM-based vulnerability detection by learning to select sensitive context. FocusVul learns commit-based annotation patterns through hierarchical semantic modeling and generalizes them to identify line-level vulnerability-relevant regions during inference. It then extracts LM-oriented context via both dependency and execution flows surrounding selected regions, yielding semantically rich inputs for effective vulnerability detection. Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that FocusVul consistently outperforms heuristic-based and full-function fine-tuning approaches, improving classification performance by 164.04% and reducing FLOPs by 19.12% on average.</p></details> |  |

We present Genetic-Instruct, a scalable algorithm for synthesizing large-scale, high quality coding instructions using evolutionary principles. Starting from a small set of seed instructions, Genetic-Instruct generates diverse and challenging instruction-code pairs by leveraging an Instructor-LLM for generation, a Coder-LLM for code synthesis, and a Judge-LLM for automatic quality evaluation. Our proposed approach is highly parallelizable and effective even with a small seed data and weaker generator models. We generated more than 7.5 million coding instructions with the proposed approach. Then we evaluated it by fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic samples and demonstrated a significant improvement in their code generation capability compared to the other synthetic generation approaches and publicly available datasets. Our results highlight the efficiency, scalability, and generalizability of the Genetic-Instruct framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to be presented in ACL 2025</p></details> |

BS leverages the network's physical limitations considering the bottleneck from each node to the destination. In particular, BS introduces a light-computational re-encoding algorithm, called Network AC-RLNC (NET), implemented independently at intermediate nodes. NET adaptively adjusts the Forward Error Correction (FEC) rates and schedules idle periods. It incorporates two distinct suspension mechanisms: 1) Blank Space Period, accounting for the forward-channels bottleneck, and 2) No-New No-FEC approach, based on data availability. The experimental results achieve significant improvements in resource efficiency, demonstrating a 20% reduction in channel usage compared to baseline RLNC solutions. Notably, these efficiency gains are achieved while maintaining competitive throughput and delay performance, ensuring improved resource utilization does not compromise network performance.</p></details> |  |

Current solutions predominantly rely on proprietary LLM agents, which introduce unpredictability and limit accessibility, raising concerns about data privacy and model customization. This paper investigates whether open-source LLMs can effectively address repository-level tasks without requiring agent-based approaches. We demonstrate this is possible by enabling LLMs to comprehend functions and files within codebases through their semantic information and structural dependencies. To this end, we introduce Code Graph Models (CGMs), which integrate repository code graph structures into the LLM's attention mechanism and map node attributes to the LLM's input space using a specialized adapter. When combined with an agentless graph RAG framework, our approach achieves a 43.00% resolution rate on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark using the open-source Qwen2.5-72B model. This performance ranks first among open weight models, second among methods with open-source systems, and eighth overall, surpassing the previous best open-source model-based method by 12.33%.</p></details> | 31 pages, 9 figures |

Currently, users are required to use a set of high-level applications to achieve their desired results. However, the advent of AI may signal a shift in this regard, as its capabilities have generated novel prospects for user-provided intent resolution through the deployment of model-generated code. This development represents a significant progression in the realm of hybrid workflows, where human and artificial intelligence collaborate to address user intentions, with the former responsible for defining these intentions and the latter for implementing the solutions to address them. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of generating and executing workflows through code generation that results from prompting an LLM with a concrete user intention, and a simplified application programming interface for a GUI-less operating system. We provide an in-depth analysis and comparison of various user intentions, the resulting code, and its execution. The findings demonstrate the general feasibility of our approach and that the employed LLM, GPT-4o-mini, exhibits remarkable proficiency in the generation of code-oriented workflows in accordance with provided user intentions.</p></details> |  |

While traditional masked language modeling (MLM) approaches do not explicitly focus on natural language interaction, emerging decoder-focused large language models (LLMs) demonstrate partial success in binary analysis yet remain underexplored for holistic comprehension. We present Assembly Augmented Tuning, an end-to-end structural-semantic instruction tuning framework that synergizes encoder architecture with decoder-based LLMs through a projector module, where the assembly encoder extracts hardware-level structural features, the projector bridges representations with the semantic space, and the instruction-tuned LLM preserves natural language capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate three key advantages: (1) State-of-the-art performance in assembly comprehension with +39.7% Recall@1 and +17.8% MRR improvements over GPT-4-Turbo, (2) Consistent enhancements across base models (24.6-107.4% Recall@1 and 15.2-106.3% MRR on Qwen2.5-Coder, Deepseek-Coder and CodeLlama variants), and (3) Superior instruction-following capabilities (41.5%-118% improvements) with controlled code generation degradation (-8.9% to -35% across architectures).</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, multiple figures</p></details> |

This sometimes does not become evident until later in their education, which can mean it is harder to fix their incorrect knowledge or misunderstandings. In addition, being able to fully understand code is increasingly important in a world where students have access to generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as GitHub Copilot. One effective solution is to utilise code comprehension questions, where a marker asks questions about a submission to gauge understanding, this can also have the side effect of helping to detect plagiarism. However, this approach is time consuming and can be difficult and/or expensive to scale. This paper introduces AutoMCQ, which uses GenAI for the automatic generation of multiple-choice code comprehension questions. This is integrated with the CodeRunner automated assessment platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking Smarter Device Control: Foresighted Planning with a World Model-Driven Code Execution Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16422v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The automatic control of mobile devices is essential for efficiently performing complex tasks that involve multiple sequential steps. However, these tasks pose significant challenges due to the limited environmental information available at each step, primarily through visual observations. As a result, current approaches, which typically rely on reactive policies, focus solely on immediate observations and often lead to suboptimal decision-making. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{Foresighted Planning with World Model-Driven Code Execution (FPWC)},a framework that prioritizes natural language understanding and structured reasoning to enhance the agent's global understanding of the environment by developing a task-oriented, refinable \emph{world model} at the outset of the task. Foresighted actions are subsequently generated through iterative planning within this world model, executed in the form of executable code. Extensive experiments conducted in simulated environments and on real mobile devices demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches, particularly achieving a 44.4\% relative improvement in task success rate compared to the state-of-the-art in the simulated environment. Code and demo are provided in the supplementary material.</p></details> |  |
| **[UBGAN: Enhancing Coded Speech with Blind and Guided Bandwidth Extension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16404v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical application of speech codecs, a multitude of factors such as the quality of the radio connection, limiting hardware or required user experience necessitate trade-offs between achievable perceptual quality, engendered bitrate and computational complexity. Most conventional and neural speech codecs operate on wideband (WB) speech signals to achieve this compromise. To further enhance the perceptual quality of coded speech, bandwidth extension (BWE) of the transmitted speech is an attractive and popular technique in conventional speech coding. In contrast, neural speech codecs are typically trained end-to-end to a specific set of requirements and are often not easily adaptable. In particular, they are typically trained to operate at a single fixed sampling rate. With the Universal Bandwidth Extension Generative Adversarial Network (UBGAN), we propose a modular and lightweight GAN-based solution that increases the operational flexibility of a wide range of conventional and neural codecs. Our model operates in the subband domain and extends the bandwidth of WB signals from 8 kHz to 16 kHz, resulting in super-wideband (SWB) signals. We further introduce two variants, guided-UBGAN and blind-UBGAN, where the guided version transmits quantized learned representation as a side information at a very low bitrate additional to the bitrate of the codec, while blind-BWE operates without such side-information. Our subjective assessments demonstrate the advantage of UBGAN applied to WB codecs and highlight the generalization capacity of our proposed method across multiple codecs and bitrates.</p></details> |  |

Key implementation details of frontier models, such as DeepSeek-R1, including data curation strategies and RL training recipe, are often omitted. Moreover, recent research indicates distillation remains more effective than RL for smaller models. In this work, we demonstrate that large-scale RL can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of strong, small- and mid-sized models, achieving results that surpass those of state-of-the-art distillation-based models. We systematically study the RL training process through extensive ablations and propose a simple yet effective approach: first training on math-only prompts, then on code-only prompts. Notably, we find that math-only RL not only significantly enhances the performance of strong distilled models on math benchmarks (e.g., +14.6% / +17.2% on AIME 2025 for the 7B / 14B models), but also code reasoning tasks (e.g., +6.8% / +5.8% on LiveCodeBench for the 7B / 14B models). In addition, extended code-only RL iterations further improve performance on code benchmarks with minimal or no degradation in math results. We develop a robust data curation pipeline to collect challenging prompts with high-quality, verifiable answers and test cases to enable verification-based RL across both domains. Finally, we identify key experimental insights, including curriculum learning with progressively increasing response lengths and the stabilizing effect of on-policy parameter updates. We find that RL not only elicits the foundational reasoning capabilities acquired during pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (e.g., distillation), but also pushes the limits of the model's reasoning ability, enabling it to solve problems that were previously unsolvable.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We release the model at: https://huggingface.co/nvidia/AceReason-Nemotron-14B</p></details> |
| **[Half-Marker Codes for Deletion Channels with Applications in DNA Storage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16344v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DNA storage systems face significant challenges, including insertion, deletion, and substitution (IDS) errors. Therefore, designing effective synchronization codes, i.e., codes capable of correcting IDS errors, is essential for DNA storage systems. Marker codes are a favorable choice for this purpose. In this paper, we extend the notion of marker codes by making the following key observation. Since each DNA base is equivalent to a 2-bit storage unit, one bit can be reserved for synchronization, while the other is dedicated to data transmission. Using this observation, we propose a new class of marker codes, which we refer to as half-marker codes. We demonstrate that this extension has the potential to significantly increase the mutual information between the input symbols and the soft outputs of an IDS channel modeling a DNA storage system. Specifically, through examples, we show that when concatenated with an outer error-correcting code, half-marker codes outperform standard marker codes and significantly reduce the end-to-end bit error rate of the system.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents a study conducted at WirelessCar Sweden AB, combining an exploratory field study of current code review practices with a field experiment involving two variations of an LLM-assisted code review tool. The field study identifies key challenges in traditional code reviews, including frequent context switching, insufficient contextual information, and highlights both opportunities (e.g., automatic summarization of complex pull requests) and concerns (e.g., false positives and trust issues) in using LLMs. In the field experiment, we developed two prototype variations: one offering LLM-generated reviews upfront and the other enabling on-demand interaction. Both utilize a semantic search pipeline based on retrieval-augmented generation to assemble relevant contextual information for the review, thereby tackling the uncovered challenges. Developers evaluated both variations in real-world settings: AI-led reviews are overall more preferred, while still being conditional on the reviewers' familiarity with the code base, as well as on the severity of the pull request.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeMind: Evaluating Large Language Models for Code Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09664v5)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used to automate programming tasks. Their capabilities have been evaluated by assessing the quality of generated code through tests or proofs. The extent to which they can reason about code is a critical question revealing important insights about their true capabilities. This paper introduces CodeMind, a framework designed to gauge the code reasoning abilities of LLMs through the following explicit and implicit code reasoning tasks: Independent Execution Reasoning (IER), Specification Reasoning (SR) and Dynamic Semantics Reasoning (DSR). The first evaluates the abilities of LLMs to simulate the execution of given inputs to a code and predict the output (IER). The second assesses the abilities of LLMs to incorporate the simulation of test data in the specification into code generation (SR). Finally, CodeMind evaluates LLMs' abilities to understand overall code semantics only given a specific input/output (DSR). Our extensive evaluation of ten LLMs across four widely used benchmarks using CodeMind shows that LLMs, depending on their size and training strategy, can reason about some dynamic aspects of code. However, their performance drops for code with higher complexity, non-trivial logical and arithmetic operators, non-primitive types, and API calls. We show that these reasoning tasks evaluate LLMs differently, and a comprehensive evaluation of code reasoning requires them all. Finally, we show that the performance of LLMs in bug repair is not correlated with any of the code reasoning tasks, and except for advanced frontier models, other LLMs do not incorporate code reasoning when performing bug repair.</p></details> |  |

Adaptive Tool Integration for Math Language Models via Expectation-Maximization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00691v3)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in mathematical problem-solving with language models (LMs) integrate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and code execution to harness their complementary strengths. However, existing hybrid frameworks exhibit a critical limitation: they depend on externally dictated instructions or rigid code-integration templates, lacking metacognitive awareness -- the capacity to dynamically evaluate intrinsic capabilities and autonomously determine when and how to integrate tools. This rigidity motivates our study of autonomous code integration, enabling models to adapt tool-usage strategies as their reasoning abilities evolve during training. While reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise for boosting LLM reasoning at scale (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), we demonstrate its inefficiency in learning autonomous code integration due to inadequate exploration of the vast combinatorial space of CoT-code interleaving patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework that synergizes structured exploration (E-step) with off-policy RL optimization (M-step), creating a self-reinforcing cycle between metacognitive tool-use decisions and evolving capabilities. Experiments reveal our method achieves superior results through improved exploration. Notably, our 7B model improves over 11% on MATH500 and 9.4% on AIME without o1-like CoT.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2025 |

While this offers scalability and flexibility, it also raises a critical, unresolved question: Can LLM judges fairly and robustly evaluate semantically equivalent code with superficial variations? Functionally correct code often exhibits variations-such as differences in variable names, comments, or formatting-that should not influence its correctness. Yet, whether LLM judges can reliably handle these variations remains unclear. We present the first comprehensive study of this issue, defining six types of potential bias in code evaluation and revealing their systematic impact on LLM judges. Across five programming languages and multiple LLMs, we empirically demonstrate that all tested LLM judges are susceptible to both positive and negative biases, resulting in inflated or unfairly low scores. Moreover, we observe that LLM judges remain vulnerable to these biases even when prompted to generate test cases before scoring, highlighting the need for more robust code evaluation methods.</p></details> | 26 pages |

However, due to the misalignment between the pixel-space distortion and human perception, such schemes often face the difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at ultra-low bitrate. To solve this problem, we propose \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{L}atent \textbf{C}oding (\textbf{GLC}) models for image and video compression, termed GLC-image and GLC-Video. The transform coding of GLC is conducted in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE). Compared to the pixel-space, such a latent space offers greater sparsity, richer semantics and better alignment with human perception, and show its advantages in achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. To further enhance performance, we improve the hyper prior by introducing a spatial categorical hyper module in GLC-image and a spatio-temporal categorical hyper module in GLC-video. Additionally, the code-prediction-based loss function is proposed to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our scheme shows high visual quality at ultra-low bitrate for both image and video compression. For image compression, GLC-image achieves an impressive bitrate of less than $0.04$ bpp, achieving the same FID as previous SOTA model MS-ILLM while using $45\%$ fewer bitrate on the CLIC 2020 test set. For video compression, GLC-video achieves 65.3\% bitrate saving over PLVC in terms of DISTS.</p></details> |  |

LeanCode uses the attention scores of `CLS' tokens within the encoder for classification tasks, such as code search. It also employs the encoder-decoder attention scores to determine token significance for sequence-to-sequence tasks like code summarization.

In this paper, we conduct a survey to explore the practitioners' perspectives on code readability in the age of LLMs and investigate the readability of our LLM-based software development agents framework, HULA, by comparing its generated code with human-written code in real-world scenarios. Overall, the findings underscore that (1) readability remains a critical aspect of software development; (2) the readability of our LLM-generated code is comparable to human-written code, fostering the establishment of appropriate trust and driving the broad adoption of our LLM-powered software development platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables, under review</p></details> |

In this paper, we investigate State Space Models (SSMs) as a potential alternative to transformers for code understanding tasks, such as code retrieval, classification, and clone detection. Previous research has already demonstrated that SSMs are more compute-efficient than transformers. In our work, we show that SSMs are also more sample-efficient and can effectively extrapolate to longer contexts (beyond the pretraining context) during fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SSMs could serve as a viable alternative to transformers for code understanding tasks, while addressing some of the major limitations associated with transformers.</p></details> |  |

DS-bench consists of 1,000 carefully constructed problems sourced from realistic problems from GitHub across ten widely used Python data science libraries. Compared to the current state-of-the-art benchmark DS-1000, DS-bench offers a more challenging and representative testbed, longer code solutions, more comprehensive data science libraries, clearer and better structured problem descriptions, and stronger test suites. To construct the DS-bench, we develop a robust pipeline that combines task scope selection, code construction, test case generation, and problem description synthesis. The process is paired with rigorous manual editing to ensure alignment and enhance evaluation reliability. Experimental result shows that DS-bench exhibits robust scaling behavior, where larger models systematically outperform smaller ones, validating its ability to distinguish model capabilities. The best LLM we test, GPT-4o, has a pass@1 of 0.202, indicating that LLMs still have a large room to improve for realistic data science code generation tasks. We believe DS-bench will serve as a rigorous and trustworthy foundation for advancing LLM-based data science programming.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Text-Rich Image Understanding via Code-Guided Synthetic Multimodal Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14846v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning about images with rich text, such as charts and documents, is a critical application of vision-language models (VLMs). However, VLMs often struggle in these domains due to the scarcity of diverse text-rich vision-language data. To address this challenge, we present CoSyn, a framework that leverages the coding capabilities of text-only large language models (LLMs) to automatically create synthetic text-rich multimodal data. Given input text describing a target domain (e.g., "nutrition fact labels"), CoSyn prompts an LLM to generate code (Python, HTML, LaTeX, etc.) for rendering synthetic images. With the underlying code as textual representations of the synthetic images, CoSyn can generate high-quality instruction-tuning data, again relying on a text-only LLM. Using CoSyn, we constructed a dataset comprising 400K images and 2.7M rows of vision-language instruction-tuning data. Comprehensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on our synthetic data achieve state-of-the-art performance among competitive open-source models, including Llama 3.2, and surpass proprietary models such as GPT-4V and Gemini 1.5 Flash. Furthermore, CoSyn can produce synthetic pointing data, enabling VLMs to ground information within input images, showcasing its potential for developing multimodal agents capable of acting in real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ACL 2025, project page: https://yueyang1996.github.io/cosyn/</p></details> |

| **[CodeI/O: Condensing Reasoning Patterns via Code Input-Output Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07316v4)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning is a fundamental capability of Large Language Models. While prior research predominantly focuses on enhancing narrow skills like math or code generation, improving performance on many other reasoning tasks remains challenging due to sparse and fragmented training data. To address this issue, we propose CodeI/O, a novel approach that systematically condenses diverse reasoning patterns inherently embedded in contextually-grounded codes, through transforming the original code into a code input-output prediction format. By training models to predict inputs/outputs given code and test cases entirely in natural language as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales, we expose them to universal reasoning primitives -- like logic flow planning, state-space searching, decision tree traversal, and modular decomposition -- while decoupling structured reasoning from code-specific syntax and preserving procedural rigor. Experimental results demonstrate CodeI/O leads to consistent improvements across symbolic, scientific, logic, math & numerical, and commonsense reasoning tasks. By matching the existing ground-truth outputs or re-executing the code with predicted inputs, we can verify each prediction and further enhance the CoTs through multi-turn revision, resulting in CodeI/O++ and achieving higher performance. Our data and models are available at https://github.com/hkust-nlp/CodeIO.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |

In this study, we evaluate the performance of code language models in non-English contexts, identifying challenges in their adoption and integration into multilingual workflows. We conduct an open-coding study to analyze errors in code comments generated by five state-of-the-art code models, CodeGemma, CodeLlama, CodeQwen1.5, GraniteCode, and StarCoder2 across five natural languages: Chinese, Dutch, English, Greek, and Polish. Our study yields a dataset of 12,500 labeled generations, which we publicly release. We then assess the reliability of standard metrics in capturing comment \textit{correctness} across languages and evaluate their trustworthiness as judgment criteria. Through our open-coding investigation, we identified a taxonomy of 26 distinct error categories in model-generated code comments. They highlight variations in language cohesion, informativeness, and syntax adherence across different natural languages. Our analysis shows that, while these models frequently produce partially correct comments, modern neural metrics fail to reliably differentiate meaningful completions from random noise. Notably, the significant score overlap between expert-rated correct and incorrect comments calls into question the effectiveness of these metrics in assessing generated comments.</p></details> | Accepted PROMISE '25 |
| **[NL-Debugging: Exploiting Natural Language as an Intermediate Representation for Code Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15356v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging is a critical aspect of LLM's coding ability. Early debugging efforts primarily focused on code-level analysis, which often falls short when addressing complex programming errors that require a deeper understanding of algorithmic logic. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted attention toward leveraging natural language reasoning to enhance code-related tasks. However, two fundamental questions remain unanswered: What type of natural language format is most effective for debugging tasks? And what specific benefits does natural language reasoning bring to the debugging process? In this paper, we introduce NL-DEBUGGING, a novel framework that employs natural language as an intermediate representation to improve code debugging. By debugging at a natural language level, we demonstrate that NL-DEBUGGING outperforms traditional debugging methods and enables a broader modification space through direct refinement guided by execution feedback. Our findings highlight the potential of natural language reasoning to advance automated code debugging and address complex programming challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[GiFT: Gibbs Fine-Tuning for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11466v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training Large Language Models (LLMs) with synthetic data is a prevalent practice in code generation. A key approach is self-training, where LLMs are iteratively trained on self-generated correct code snippets. In this case, the self-generated codes are drawn from a conditional distribution, conditioned on a specific seed description. However, the seed description is not the only valid representation that aligns with its intended meaning. With all valid descriptions and codes forming a joint space, codes drawn from the conditional distribution would lead to an underrepresentation of the full description-code space. As such, we propose Gibbs Fine-Tuning (GiFT), a novel self-training method inspired by Gibbs sampling. GiFT allows self-generated data to be drawn from the marginal distribution of the joint space, thereby mitigating the biases inherent in conditional sampling. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the potential benefits of fine-tuning LLMs with code derived from the marginal distribution. Furthermore, we propose a perplexity-based code selection method to mitigate the imbalanced long-tail distribution of the self-generated codes. Empirical evaluation of two LLMs across four datasets demonstrates that GiFT achieves superior performance, particularly on more challenging benchmarks.

| **[Local Loss Optimization in the Infinite Width: Stable Parameterization of Predictive Coding Networks and Target Propagation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02001v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Local learning, which trains a network through layer-wise local targets and losses, has been studied as an alternative to backpropagation (BP) in neural computation. However, its algorithms often become more complex or require additional hyperparameters because of the locality, making it challenging to identify desirable settings in which the algorithm progresses in a stable manner. To provide theoretical and quantitative insights, we introduce the maximal update parameterization ($\mu$P) in the infinite-width limit for two representative designs of local targets: predictive coding (PC) and target propagation (TP). We verified that $\mu$P enables hyperparameter transfer across models of different widths. Furthermore, our analysis revealed unique and intriguing properties of $\mu$P that are not present in conventional BP. By analyzing deep linear networks, we found that PC's gradients interpolate between first-order and Gauss-Newton-like gradients, depending on the parameterization. We demonstrate that, in specific standard settings, PC in the infinite-width limit behaves more similarly to the first-order gradient. For TP, even with the standard scaling of the last layer, which differs from classical $\mu$P, its local loss optimization favors the feature learning regime over the kernel regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[RAG or Fine-tuning? A Comparative Study on LCMs-based Code Completion in Industry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15179v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code completion, a crucial practice in industrial settings, helps developers improve programming efficiency by automatically suggesting code snippets during development. With the emergence of Large Code Models (LCMs), this field has witnessed significant advancements. Due to the natural differences between open-source and industrial codebases, such as coding patterns and unique internal dependencies, it is a common practice for developers to conduct domain adaptation when adopting LCMs in industry. There exist multiple adaptation approaches, among which retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and fine-tuning are the two most popular paradigms. However, no prior research has explored the trade-off of the two approaches in industrial scenarios. To mitigate the gap, we comprehensively compare the two paradigms including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Fine-tuning (FT), for industrial code completion in this paper. In collaboration with Tencent's WXG department, we collect over 160,000 internal C++ files as our codebase. We then compare the two types of adaptation approaches from three dimensions that are concerned by industrial practitioners, including effectiveness, efficiency, and parameter sensitivity, using six LCMs. Our findings reveal that RAG, when implemented with appropriate embedding models that map code snippets into dense vector representations, can achieve higher accuracy than fine-tuning alone. Specifically, BM25 presents superior retrieval effectiveness and efficiency among studied RAG methods. Moreover, RAG and fine-tuning are orthogonal and their combination leads to further improvement. We also observe that RAG demonstrates better scalability than FT, showing more sustained performance gains with larger scales of codebase.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in FSE 25 Industry Track</p></details> |

Despite advancements through few-shot prompting and query expansion, existing methods remain limited in handling ambiguous and complex queries, thereby requiring manual intervention. To overcome these limitations, we propose VisPath: a Multi-Path Reasoning and Feedback-Driven Optimization Framework for Visualization Code Generation. VisPath handles underspecified queries through structured, multi-stage processing. It begins by reformulating the user input via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which refers to the initial query while generating multiple extended queries in parallel, enabling the LLM to capture diverse interpretations of the user intent. These queries then generate candidate visualization scripts, which are executed to produce diverse images. By assessing the visual quality and correctness of each output, VisPath generates targeted feedback that is aggregated to synthesize an optimal final result. Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmarks including MatPlotBench and the Qwen-Agent Code Interpreter Benchmark show that VisPath outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a more reliable solution for AI-driven visualization code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, its manual memory management model frequently leads to memory safety issues. In response, a modern system programming language, Rust, has emerged as a memory-safe alternative. Moreover, automating the C-to-Rust translation empowered by the rapid advancements of the generative capabilities of LLMs is gaining growing interest for large volumes of legacy C code. Despite some success, existing LLM-based approaches have constrained the role of LLMs to static prompt-response behavior and have not explored their agentic problem-solving capability. Applying the LLM agentic capability for the C-to-Rust translation introduces distinct challenges, as this task differs from the traditional LLM agent applications, such as math or commonsense QA domains. First, the scarcity of parallel C-to-Rust datasets hinders the retrieval of suitable code translation exemplars for in-context learning. Second, unlike math or commonsense QA, the intermediate steps required for C-to-Rust are not well-defined. Third, it remains unclear how to organize and cascade these intermediate steps to construct a correct translation trajectory. To address these challenges in the C-to-Rust translation, we propose a novel intermediate step, the Virtual Fuzzing-based equivalence Test (VFT), and an agentic planning framework, the LLM-powered Agent for C-to-Rust code translation (LAC2R). The VFT guides LLMs to identify input arguments that induce divergent behaviors between an original C function and its Rust counterpart and to generate informative diagnoses to refine the unsafe Rust code. LAC2R uses the MCTS to systematically organize the LLM-induced intermediate steps for correct translation. We experimentally demonstrated that LAC2R effectively conducts C-to-Rust translation on large-scale, real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful mathematical capabilities, and the Chain-of-Thought technique, which guides LLMs through step-by-step reasoning, has yielded impressive results. However, this reasoning ability is limited by the computational weaknesses of LLMs themselves, where calculation errors can accumulate, leading to incorrect final answers. To address this, we propose Program of Equations Thoughts (POET), which transforms the task of generating step-by-step reasoning answers into a two-stage task of predicting equations and generating code, offloading complex computations to a Python interpreter to avoid calculation errors in LLMs. Furthermore, we propose Zero-shot POET, which utilizes a manually designed template to enable LLMs to directly generate Python code for one-step solving. Our method achieves accuracies of 95.3% and 98.0% on the PEN and ALG514 datasets, respectively, setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Zero-shot POET also achieves the SOTA result of 95.5% on the DRAW-1K dataset.</p></details> |  |

This work presents a computational methodology for searching for pathways in reaction networks which is based on integer linear programming and the modeling of reaction networks by directed hypergraphs. Often multiple pathways fit the given search criteria. To rank them, we develop an objective function based on physical arguments maximizing the probability of the pathway. We furthermore develop an automated pipeline to estimate the energy barriers of individual reactions in reaction networks. Combined, the methodology facilitates flexible and kinetically informed pathway investigations on large reaction networks by computational means, even for networks coming without kinetic annotation, such as those created via generative approaches for expanding molecular spaces.</p></details> | 29 pages |

We intend to apply these concepts to the field of Control in space, enabling LLMs to play a significant role in the decision-making process for autonomous satellite operations. As a first step towards this goal, we have developed a pure LLM-based solution for the Kerbal Space Program Differential Games (KSPDG) challenge, a public software design competition where participants create autonomous agents for maneuvering satellites involved in non-cooperative space operations, running on the KSP game engine. Our approach leverages prompt engineering, few-shot prompting, and fine-tuning techniques to create an effective LLM-based agent that ranked 2nd in the competition.

We propose a low-cost visual program distillation method that can be used for models with at most 1 billion parameters and requires no human-generated program annotations. We achieve this through synthetic data augmentation based on decoupling programs into higher-level skills, called templates, and their corresponding arguments. Experimental results show that, with a relatively small amount of question/answer data, small language models can generate high-quality specialized visual programs with the added benefit of much faster inference</p></details> |  |
| **[Weighted Pseudorandom Generators for Read-Once Branching Programs via Weighted Pseudorandom Reductions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.08272v2)** | 2025-05-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study weighted pseudorandom generators (WPRGs) and derandomizations for read-once branching programs (ROBPs). Denote $n$ and $w$ as the length and the width of a ROBP. We have the following results. For standard ROBPs, there exists an explicit $\varepsilon$-WPRG with seed length $$ O\left(\frac{\log n\log (nw)}{\max\left\{1,\log\log w-\log\log n\right\}}+\log w \left(\log\log\log w-\log\log\max\left\{2,\frac{\log w}{\log n/\varepsilon}\right\}\right)+\log(1/\varepsilon)\right).$$ When $n = w^{o(1)},$ this is better than the constructions in Hoza (RANDOM 2022), Cohen, Doron, Renard, Sberlo, and Ta-Shma (CCC 2021).Further, by using this result in a black-box way, we attain a WPRG for regular ROBPs with seed length $$O\left(\log n\left(\sqrt{\log(1/\varepsilon)}+\log w+\log\log n\right)+\log(1/\varepsilon)\right).$$ This slightly improves the result of Chen, Hoza, Lyu, Tal, and Wu (FOCS 2023) and matches the recent simultaneous and independent work of Chen and Ta-shma. For permutation ROBPs with unbounded widths and single accept nodes, there exists an explicit $\varepsilon$-WPRG with seed length $$ O\left( \log n\left( \log\log n + \sqrt{\log(1/\varepsilon)} \right)+\log(1/\varepsilon)\right). $$ This slightly improves the result of Chen, Hoza, Lyu, Tal, and Wu (FOCS 2023). For regular ROBPs with $n \leq 2^{O(\sqrt{\log w})}, \varepsilon = 1/\text{poly} w$, we give a derandomization within space $O(\log w)$, i.e. in $\mathbf{L}$ exactly. This is better than previous results of Ahmadinejad, Kelner, Murtagh, Peebles, Sidford, and Vadhan (FOCS 2020) in this regime, and we improves the time complexity from super-polynomial to standard polynomial. Our main method is based on a recursive application of weighted pseudorandom reductions, which is a natural notion that is used to simplify ROBPs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fixing 7,400 Bugs for 1$: Cheap Crash-Site Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13103v2)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of bug-finding techniques has led to the discovery of more vulnerabilities than developers can reasonably fix, creating an urgent need for effective Automated Program Repair (APR) methods. However, the complexity of modern bugs often makes precise root cause analysis difficult and unreliable. To address this challenge, we propose crash-site repair to simplify the repair task while still mitigating the risk of exploitation. In addition, we introduce a template-guided patch generation approach that significantly reduces the token cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining both efficiency and effectiveness. We implement our prototype system, WILLIAMT, and evaluate it against state-of-the-art APR tools. Our results show that, when combined with the top-performing agent CodeRover-S, WILLIAMT reduces token cost by 45.9% and increases the bug-fixing rate to 73.5% (+29.6%) on ARVO, a ground-truth open source software vulnerabilities benchmark. Furthermore, we demonstrate that WILLIAMT can function effectively even without access to frontier LLMs: even a local model running on a Mac M4 Mini achieves a reasonable repair rate. These findings highlight the broad applicability and scalability of WILLIAMT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Program Quantum Measurements for Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13525v2)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have sparked significant interest, driving extensive exploration of quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to address a wide range of complex challenges. The development of high-performance QML models requires expert-level expertise, presenting a key challenge to the widespread adoption of QML. Critical obstacles include the design of effective data encoding strategies and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which are vital for the performance of QML models. Furthermore, the measurement process is often neglected-most existing QML models employ predefined measurement schemes that may not align with the specific requirements of the targeted problem. We propose an innovative framework that renders the observable of a quantum system-specifically, the Hermitian matrix-trainable. This approach employs an end-to-end differentiable learning framework, enabling simultaneous optimization of the neural network used to program the parameterized observables and the standard quantum circuit parameters. Notably, the quantum observable parameters are dynamically programmed by the neural network, allowing the observables to adapt in real time based on the input data stream. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method effectively programs observables dynamically within variational quantum circuits, achieving superior results compared to existing approaches. Notably, it delivers enhanced performance metrics, such as higher classification accuracy, thereby significantly improving the overall effectiveness of QML models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chemical classification program synthesis using generative artificial intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18470v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately classifying chemical structures is essential for cheminformatics and bioinformatics, including tasks such as identifying bioactive compounds of interest, screening molecules for toxicity to humans, finding non-organic compounds with desirable material properties, or organizing large chemical libraries for drug discovery or environmental monitoring. However, manual classification is labor-intensive and difficult to scale to large chemical databases. Existing automated approaches either rely on manually constructed classification rules, or the use of deep learning methods that lack explainability. This work presents an approach that uses generative artificial intelligence to automatically write chemical classifier programs for classes in the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) database. These programs can be used for efficient deterministic run-time classification of SMILES structures, with natural language explanations. The programs themselves constitute an explainable computable ontological model of chemical class nomenclature, which we call the ChEBI Chemical Class Program Ontology (C3PO). We validated our approach against the ChEBI database, and compared our results against state of the art deep learning models. We also demonstrate the use of C3PO to classify out-of-distribution examples taken from metabolomics repositories and natural product databases. We also demonstrate the potential use of our approach to find systematic classification errors in existing chemical databases, and show how an ensemble artificial intelligence approach combining generated ontologies, automated literature search, and multimodal vision models can be used to pinpoint potential errors requiring expert validation</p></details> |  |

To further enhance this accessibility, recent research has focused on generating VPL code from user instructions using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, by employing prompting-based methods, these studies have shown promising results. Nevertheless, such approaches can be less effective for industrial VPLs such as Ladder Diagram (LD). LD is a pivotal language used in industrial automation processes and involves extensive domain-specific configurations, which are difficult to capture in a single prompt. In this work, we demonstrate that training-based methods outperform prompting-based methods for LD generation accuracy, even with smaller backbone models. Building on these findings, we propose a two-stage training strategy to further enhance VPL generation. First, we employ retrieval-augmented fine-tuning to leverage the repetitive use of subroutines commonly seen in industrial VPLs. Second, we apply direct preference optimization (DPO) to further guide the model toward accurate outputs, using systematically generated preference pairs through graph editing operations. Extensive experiments on real-world LD data demonstrate that our approach improves program-level accuracy by over 10% compared to supervised fine-tuning, which highlights its potential to advance industrial automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2025 (Main, long paper)</p></details> |

This symbolic search is fundamentally limited by its inability to directly reason about program behavior. We introduce Gradient-Based Program Repair (GBPR), a new paradigm that reframes program repair as continuous optimization in a differentiable numerical program space. Our core insight is to compile symbolic programs into differentiable numerical representations, enabling search in the numerical program space directly guided by program behavior. To evaluate GBPR, we present RaspBugs, a new benchmark of 1,466 buggy symbolic RASP programs and their respective numerical representations. Our experiments demonstrate that GBPR can effectively repair buggy symbolic programs by gradient-based optimization in the numerical program space, with convincing repair trajectories. To our knowledge, we are the first to state program repair as continuous optimization in a numerical program space. Our work establishes a new direction for program repair research, bridging two rich worlds: continuous optimization and program behavior.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we address this gap by formalizing the Program-to-Geometry task, which challenges models to translate programmatic drawing code into accurate and abstract geometric reasoning. To evaluate this capability, we present GeoGramBench, a benchmark of 500 carefully refined problems organized by a tailored three-level taxonomy that considers geometric complexity rather than traditional mathematical reasoning complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier LLMs reveals consistent and pronounced deficiencies: even the most advanced models achieve less than 50% accuracy at the highest abstraction level. These results highlight the unique challenges posed by program-driven spatial reasoning and establish GeoGramBench as a valuable resource for advancing research in symbolic-to-spatial geometric reasoning.

However, the training of TAL models requires a substantial amount of manually annotated data. Data programming is an efficient method to create training labels with a series of human-defined labeling functions. However, its application in TAL faces difficulties of defining complex actions in the context of temporal video frames. In this paper, we propose ProTAL, a drag-and-link video programming framework for TAL. ProTAL enables users to define \textbf{key events} by dragging nodes representing body parts and objects and linking them to constrain the relations (direction, distance, etc.). These definitions are used to generate action labels for large-scale unlabelled videos. A semi-supervised method is then employed to train TAL models with such labels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProTAL through a usage scenario and a user study, providing insights into designing video programming framework.</p></details> | Accepted at CHI'25 |
| **[Planning-Driven Programming: A Large Language Model Programming Workflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14503v3)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The strong performance of large language models (LLMs) raises extensive discussion on their application to code generation. Recent research suggests continuous program refinements through visible tests to improve code generation accuracy in LLMs. However, these methods suffer from LLMs' inefficiency and limited reasoning capacity. In this work, we propose an LLM programming workflow (LPW) designed to improve both initial code generation and subsequent refinements within a structured two-phase workflow. Specifically, the solution generation phase formulates a solution plan, which is then verified through visible tests to specify the intended natural language solution. Subsequently, the code implementation phase drafts an initial code according to the solution plan and its verification. If the generated code fails the visible tests, the plan verification serves as the intended solution to consistently inform the refinement process for correcting bugs. Compared to state-of-the-art methods across various existing LLMs, LPW significantly improves the Pass@1 accuracy by up to 16.4% on well-established text-to-code generation benchmarks. LPW also sets new state-of-the-art Pass@1 accuracy, achieving 98.2% on HumanEval, 84.8% on MBPP, 59.3% on LiveCode, 62.6% on APPS, and 34.7% on CodeContest, using GPT-4o as the backbone.

Hence, {log} can be used as a declarative, set, logic programming language and as an automated theorem prover for set theory. Over time {log} has been extended with some components integrated to the satisfiability solver thus providing a formal verification environment. In this paper we make a comprehensive presentation of this environment which includes a language for the description of state machines based on set theory, an interactive environment for the execution of functional scenarios over state machines, a generator of verification conditions for state machines, automated verification of state machines, and test case generation. State machines are both, programs and specifications; exactly the same code works as a program and as its specification. In this way, with a few additions, a CLP language turned into a seamlessly integrated programming and automated proof system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Theory and Practice of Logic Programming</p></details> |

While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning, it struggles with non-English languages due to the entanglement of reasoning and execution. Program-of-Thought (PoT) prompting separates reasoning from execution, offering a promising alternative but shifting the challenge to generating programs from non-English questions. We propose a framework to evaluate PoT by separating multilingual reasoning from code execution to examine (i) the impact of fine-tuning on question-reasoning alignment and (ii) how reasoning quality affects answer correctness. Our findings demonstrate that PoT fine-tuning substantially enhances multilingual reasoning, outperforming CoT fine-tuned models. We further demonstrate a strong correlation between reasoning quality (measured through code quality) and answer accuracy, highlighting its potential as a test-time performance improvement heuristic.</p></details> |  |

A mixed-methods study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16764v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many application domains, domain-specific languages can allow domain experts to contribute to collaborative projects more correctly and efficiently. To do so, they must be able to understand program structure from reading existing source code. With high-quality data becoming an increasingly important resource, the creation of data pipelines is an important application domain for domain-specific languages. We execute a mixed-method study consisting of a controlled experiment and a follow-up descriptive survey among the participants to understand the effects of a domain-specific language on bottom-up program understanding and generate hypotheses for future research. During the experiment, participants need the same time to solve program structure comprehension tasks, but are significantly more correct when using the domain-specific language. In the descriptive survey, participants describe reasons related to the programming language itself, such as a better pipeline overview, more enforced code structure, and a closer alignment to the mental model of a data pipeline. In addition, human factors such as less required programming experience and the ability to reuse experience from other data engineering tools are discussed. Based on these results, domain-specific languages are a promising tool for creating data pipelines that can increase correct understanding of program structure and lower barriers to entry for domain experts. Open questions exist to make more informed implementation decisions for domain-specific languages for data pipelines in the future.</p></details> |  |

In this setting, the objective function associated with the optimization problem is a summation of a set of functions, each held by one node in a network. The semi-infinite constraint, on the other hand, is known to all agents. The nodes collectively aim to solve the problem using local data about the objective and limited communication capabilities depending on the network topology. Our algorithm is built on three key ingredients: consensus step, gradient descent in the local objective, and local gradient descent iterations in the constraint at a node when the estimate violates the semi-infinite constraint. The algorithm is constructed, and its parameters are prescribed in such a way that the iterates held by each agent provably converge to an optimizer. That is, as the algorithm progresses, the estimates achieve consensus, and the constraint violation and the error in the optimal value are bounded above by vanishing terms. Simulation examples illustrate our results.</p></details> | 16 pages, 1 figure |

Song et al. The v7.3 introduced a new Clang-based C++ front-end to address the challenges posed by modern C++ programs. Although the new front-end has demonstrated significant potential in previous studies, it remains in the developmental stage and lacks several essential features. ESBMC v7.6 further enhanced this foundation by adding and extending features based on the Clang AST, such as 1) exception handling, 2) extended memory management and memory safety verification, including dangling pointers, duplicate deallocation, memory leaks and rvalue references and 3) new operational models for STL updating the outdated C++ operational models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ESBMC v7.6 can handle a significantly broader range of C++ features introduced in recent versions of the C++ standard.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 2 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2308.05649</p></details> |

We argue that successfully deploying AI software engineers requires a level of trust equal to or even greater than the trust established by human-driven software engineering practices. The recent trend toward LLM agents offers a path toward integrating the power of LLMs to create new code with the power of analysis tools to increase trust in the code. This opinion piece comments on whether LLM agents could dominate software engineering workflows in the future and whether the focus of programming will shift from programming at scale to programming with trust.</p></details> | 5 pages |

While large language models (LLMs) have recently shown impressive capabilities in a variety of tasks, they continue to struggle with complex puzzles that demand precise reasoning and exhaustive search. In this paper, we propose Logic-of-Thought (Logot), a novel framework that bridges LLMs with logic programming to address this problem. Our method leverages LLMs to translate puzzle rules and states into answer set programs (ASPs), the solution of which are then accurately and efficiently inferred by an ASP interpreter. This hybrid approach combines the natural language understanding of LLMs with the precise reasoning capabilities of logic programs. We evaluate our method on various grid puzzles and dynamic puzzles involving actions, demonstrating near-perfect accuracy across all tasks. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/naiqili/Logic-of-Thought.</p></details> |  |

The intuition behind this is that the programming languages (PLs) inherently exhibit greater structural organization than natural languages (NLs). This structural advantage makes PLs particularly suited for IE tasks. Nevertheless, existing research primarily focuses on Python for code-style simulation, overlooking the potential of other widely-used PLs (e.g., C++ and Java) during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase. In this research, we propose \textbf{M}ultiple \textbf{P}rogramming \textbf{L}anguages with large language models for information extraction (abbreviated as \textbf{MPL}), a novel framework that explores the potential of incorporating different PLs in the SFT phase. Additionally, we introduce \texttt{function-prompt} with virtual running to simulate code-style inputs more effectively and efficiently. Experimental results on a wide range of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MPL. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to provide a comprehensive analysis. We have released our code for future research.</p></details> | Findings of ACL2025 |

We investigate whether synthetic data generation can help identify at-risk students earlier in a small, imbalanced dataset from an introductory programming module. The analysis used anonymised records from 379 students, with 15\% marked as failing, and applied several machine learning algorithms. The first experiments showed poor recall for the failing group. However, using synthetic data generation methods led to a significant improvement in performance. Our results suggest that machine learning can help identify at-risk students early in programming courses when combined with synthetic data. This research lays the groundwork for validating and using these models with live student cohorts in the future, to allow for timely and effective interventions that can improve student outcomes. It also includes feature importance analysis to refine formative tasks. Overall, this study contributes to developing practical workflows that help detect disengagement early and improve student success in programming education.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the Doctoral Consortium Track at AIED 2025, (Pre-Print)</p></details> |
| **[Data-driven Verification of Procedural Programs with Integer Arrays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15958v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of verifying automatically procedural programs manipulating parametric-size arrays of integers, encoded as a constrained Horn clauses solving problem. We propose a new algorithmic method for synthesizing loop invariants and procedure pre/post-conditions represented as universally quantified first-order formulas constraining the array elements and program variables. We adopt a data-driven approach that extends the decision tree Horn-ICE framework to handle arrays. We provide a powerful learning technique based on reducing a complex classification problem of vectors of integer arrays to a simpler classification problem of vectors of integers. The obtained classifier is generalized to get universally quantified invariants and procedure pre/post-conditions. We have implemented our method and shown its efficiency and competitiveness w.r.t. state-of-the-art tools on a significant benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Intermediate Program Representation for Optimizing Stream-Based Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21458v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stream-based runtime monitors are safety assurance tools that check at runtime whether the system's behavior satisfies a formal specification. Specifications consist of stream equations, which relate input streams, containing sensor readings and other incoming information, to output streams, representing filtered and aggregated data. This paper presents a framework for the stream-based specification language RTLola. We introduce a new intermediate representation for stream-based languages, the StreamIR, which, like the specification language, operates on streams of unbounded length; while the stream equations are replaced by imperative programs. We developed a set of optimizations based on static analysis of the specification and have implemented an interpreter and a compiler for several target languages. In our evaluation, we measure the performance of several real-world case studies. The results show that using the StreamIR framework reduces the runtime significantly compared to the existing StreamIR interpreter. We evaluate the effect of the optimizations and show that significant performance gains are possible beyond the optimizations of the target language's compiler. While our current implementation is limited to RTLola, the StreamIR is designed to accommodate other stream-based languages, enabling their interpretation and compilation into all available target languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Let's Take Esoteric Programming Languages Seriously](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15327v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Esoteric programming languages are challenging to learn, but their unusual features and constraints may serve to improve programming ability. From languages designed to be intentionally obtuse (e.g. INTERCAL) to others targeting artistic expression (e.g. Piet) or exploring the nature of computation (e.g. Fractan), there is rich variety in the realm of esoteric programming languages. This essay examines the counterintuitive appeal of esoteric languages and seeks to analyse reasons for this popularity. We will explore why people are attracted to esoteric languages in terms of (a) program comprehension and construction, as well as (b) language design and implementation. Our assertion is that esoteric languages can improve general PL awareness, at the same time as enabling the esoteric programmer to impress their peers with obscure knowledge. We will also consider pedagogic principles and the use of AI, in relation to esoteric languages. Emerging from the specific discussion, we identify a general set of 'good' reasons for designing new programming languages. It may not be possible to be exhaustive on this topic, and it is certain we have not achieved that goal here. However we believe our most important contribution is to draw attention to the varied and often implicit motivations involved in programming language design.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[LogiCase: Effective Test Case Generation from Logical Description in Competitive Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15039v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Test Case Generation (ATCG) is crucial for evaluating software reliability, particularly in competitive programming where robust algorithm assessments depend on diverse and accurate test cases. However, existing ATCG methods often fail to meet complex specifications or generate effective corner cases, limiting their utility. In this work, we introduce Context-Free Grammars with Counters (CCFGs), a formalism that captures both syntactic and semantic structures in input specifications. Using a fine-tuned CodeT5 model, we translate natural language input specifications into CCFGs, enabling the systematic generation of high-quality test cases. Experiments on the CodeContests dataset demonstrate that CCFG-based test cases outperform baseline methods in identifying incorrect algorithms, achieving significant gains in validity and effectiveness. Our approach provides a scalable and reliable grammar-driven framework for enhancing automated competitive programming evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[EquiBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models' Understanding of Program Semantics via Equivalence Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12466v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become integral to code-related tasks, a central question emerges: do LLMs truly understand program execution semantics? We introduce EquiBench, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs through equivalence checking, i.e., determining whether two programs produce identical outputs for all possible inputs. Unlike prior code generation benchmarks, this task directly tests a model's understanding of code execution semantics. EquiBench consists of 2400 program pairs across four languages and six categories. These pairs are generated through program analysis, compiler scheduling, and superoptimization, ensuring high-confidence labels, nontrivial difficulty, and full automation. The transformations span syntactic edits, structural modifications, and algorithmic changes, covering a broad spectrum of semantic variation. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art LLMs and find that in the most challenging categories, the best accuracies are 63.8% and 76.2%, only modestly above the 50% random baseline. Further analysis reveals that models often rely on syntactic similarity rather than exhibiting robust reasoning over execution semantics, highlighting fundamental limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cassandra: Efficient Enforcement of Sequential Execution for Cryptographic Programs (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04290v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constant-time programming is a widely deployed approach to harden cryptographic programs against side channel attacks. However, modern processors often violate the underlying assumptions of standard constant-time policies by transiently executing unintended paths of the program. Despite many solutions proposed, addressing control flow misspeculations in an efficient way without losing performance is an open problem. In this work, we propose Cassandra, a novel hardware/software mechanism to enforce sequential execution for constant-time cryptographic code in a highly efficient manner. Cassandra explores the radical design point of disabling the branch predictor and recording-and-replaying sequential control flow of the program. Two key insights that enable our design are that (1) the sequential control flow of a constant-time program is mostly static over different runs, and (2) cryptographic programs are loop-intensive and their control flow patterns repeat in a highly compressible way. These insights allow us to perform an upfront branch analysis that significantly compresses control flow traces. We add a small component to a typical processor design, the Branch Trace Unit, to store compressed traces and determine fetch redirections according to the sequential model of the program. Despite providing a strong security guarantee, Cassandra counterintuitively provides an average 1.85% speedup compared to an unsafe baseline processor, mainly due to enforcing near-perfect fetch redirections.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables, 1 listing</p></details> |

This paper introduces a unified, foundational approach to verifying such programs. Central to our approach is the knitted-tree encoding, modeling each program execution as a tree structure capturing input, output, and intermediate states. Leveraging the compositional nature of knitted-trees, we encode these structures as constrained Horn clauses (CHCs), reducing verification to CHC satisfiability task. To illustrate our approach, we focus on memory safety and show how it naturally leads to simple, modular invariants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transductively Informed Inductive Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14744v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abstraction and reasoning in program synthesis has seen significant progress through both inductive and transductive paradigms. Inductive approaches generate a program or latent function from input-output examples, which can then be applied to new inputs. Transductive approaches directly predict output values for given inputs, effectively serving as the function themselves. Current approaches combine inductive and transductive models via isolated ensembling, but they do not explicitly model the interaction between both paradigms. In this work, we introduce \acs{tiips}, a novel framework that unifies transductive and inductive strategies by explicitly modeling their interactions through a cooperative mechanism: an inductive model generates programs, while a transductive model constrains, guides, and refines the search to improve synthesis accuracy and generalization. We evaluate \acs{tiips} on two widely studied program synthesis domains: string and list manipulation. Our results show that \acs{tiips} solves more tasks and yields functions that more closely match optimal solutions in syntax and semantics, particularly in out-of-distribution settings, yielding state-of-the-art performance. We believe that explicitly modeling the synergy between inductive and transductive reasoning opens promising avenues for general-purpose program synthesis and broader applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Reasoning for Repair Based on Inferred Program Intent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13008v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has shown promising results, particularly with the use of neural networks. Currently, most APR tools focus on code transformations specified by test suites, rather than reasoning about the program intent and the high-level bug specification. Without a proper understanding of program intent, these tools tend to generate patches that overfit incomplete test suites and fail to reflect the developers intentions. However, reasoning about program intent is challenging. In our work, we propose an approach called AdverIntent-Agent, based on critique and adversarial reasoning. Our approach is novel to shift the focus from generating multiple APR patches to inferring multiple potential program intents. Ideally, we aim to infer intents that are, to some extent, adversarial to each other, maximizing the probability that at least one aligns closely with the developers original intent. AdverIntent-Agent is a multi-agent approach consisting of three agents: a reasoning agent, a test agent, and a repair agent. First, the reasoning agent generates adversarial program intents along with the corresponding faulty statements. Next, the test agent produces adversarial test cases that align with each inferred intent, constructing oracles that use the same inputs but have different expected outputs. Finally, the repair agent uses dynamic and precise LLM prompts to generate patches that satisfy both the inferred program intent and the generated tests. AdverIntent-Agent was evaluated on two benchmarks: Defects4J 2.0 and HumanEval-Java. AdverIntent-Agent correctly repaired 77 and 105 bugs in both benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[CPRet: A Dataset, Benchmark, and Model for Retrieval in Competitive Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12925v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competitive programming benchmarks are widely used in scenarios such as programming contests and large language model assessments. However, the growing presence of duplicate or highly similar problems raises concerns not only about competition fairness, but also about the validity of competitive programming as a benchmark for model evaluation. In this paper, we propose a new problem -- similar question retrieval -- to address this issue. Due to the lack of both data and models, solving this problem is challenging. To this end, we introduce CPRet, a retrieval-oriented benchmark suite for competitive programming, covering four retrieval tasks: two code-centric (i.e., Text-to-Code and Code-to-Code) and two newly proposed problem-centric tasks (i.e., Problem-to-Duplicate and Simplified-to-Full), built from a combination of automatically crawled problem-solution data and manually curated annotations. Our contribution includes both high-quality training data and temporally separated test sets for reliable evaluation. In addition, we develop two task-specialized retrievers based on this dataset: CPRetriever-Code, trained with a novel Group-InfoNCE loss for problem-code alignment, and CPRetriever-Prob, fine-tuned for identifying problem-level similarity. Both models achieve strong results and are open-sourced for local use. Finally, we analyze LiveCodeBench and find that high-similarity problems inflate model pass rates and reduce differentiation, underscoring the need for similarity-aware evaluation in future benchmarks.

| **[CodeGRAG: Bridging the Gap between Natural Language and Programming Language via Graphical Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02355v4)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing large language models to generate codes has shown promising meaning in software development revolution. Despite the intelligence shown by the large language models, their specificity in code generation can still be improved due to the syntactic gap and mismatched vocabulary existing between natural language and programming languages. In this paper, we propose CodeGRAG, a Graphical Retrieval Augmented Code Generation framework that bridges the gap between NL and PL to enhance the performance of LLMs. CodeGRAG builds the graphical view of code blocks based on the control flow and data flow of them to better interpret the programming domain knowledge, which can facilitate natural language based LLMs for better understanding of code syntax and serve as a bridge among different programming languages. To take the extracted structural knowledge into the foundation models, we propose 1) a hard meta-graph prompt template to transform the challenging syntax graph into informative graphical view for tuning-free models and 2) a soft prompting technique that injects the domain knowledge of programming languages into model parameters via finetuning the models with the soft signals encoded by GNN expert model. Specifically, two constraints are designed to improve the alignment and structure expressiveness, contributing to the informativeness of the single-token-sized external <GraphEmb> for enhanced code generation. CodeGRAG significantly improves the code generation ability of LLMs and can even offer performance gain for cross-lingual code generation. Implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Code-5970/ .</p></details> |  |
| **[On-Policy Optimization with Group Equivalent Preference for Multi-Programming Language Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12723v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance in code generation tasks. However, a significant performance disparity persists between popular programming languages (e.g., Python, C++) and others. To address this capability gap, we leverage the code translation task to train LLMs, thereby facilitating the transfer of coding proficiency across diverse programming languages. Moreover, we introduce OORL for training, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates on-policy and off-policy strategies. Within OORL, on-policy RL is applied during code translation, guided by a rule-based reward signal derived from unit tests. Complementing this coarse-grained rule-based reward, we propose Group Equivalent Preference Optimization (GEPO), a novel preference optimization method. Specifically, GEPO trains the LLM using intermediate representations (IRs) groups. LLMs can be guided to discern IRs equivalent to the source code from inequivalent ones, while also utilizing signals about the mutual equivalence between IRs within the group. This process allows LLMs to capture nuanced aspects of code functionality. By employing OORL for training with code translation tasks, LLMs improve their recognition of code functionality and their understanding of the relationships between code implemented in different languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our OORL for LLMs training with code translation tasks achieves significant performance improvements on code benchmarks across multiple programming languages.</p></details> |  |

However, prior AI applications lack support for text-to-parametric models, essential for generating and optimizing diverse parametric design options. This study introduces Text-to-Visual Programming (Text2VP) GPT, a novel generative AI derived from GPT-4.1, designed to automate graph-based visual programming workflows, parameters, and their interconnections. Text2VP leverages detailed documentation, specific instructions, and example-driven few-shot learning to reflect user intentions accurately and facilitate interactive parameter adjustments. Testing demonstrates Text2VP's capability in generating functional parametric models, although higher complexity models present increased error rates. This research highlights generative AI's potential in visual programming and parametric modeling, laying groundwork for future improvements to manage complex modeling tasks. Ultimately, Text2VP aims to enable designers to easily create and modify parametric models without extensive training in specialized platforms like Grasshopper.</p></details> | <details><summary>Demon...</summary><p>Demonstration Video: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUOmOLuLSaDWss2En2buixBxvTPy-lDvA</p></details> |

While learning-to-optimize (L2O) methods have been successful at continuous optimization, extending them to MINLPs is challenging due to integer constraints. To overcome this, we propose a novel L2O approach with two integer correction layers to ensure the integrality of the solution and a projection step to ensure the feasibility of the solution. We prove that the projection step converges, providing a theoretical guarantee for our method. Our experiments show that our methods efficiently solve MINLPs with up to tens of thousands of variables, providing high-quality solutions within milliseconds, even for problems where traditional solvers and heuristics fail. This is the first general L2O method for parametric MINLPs, finding solutions to some of the largest instances reported to date.</p></details> |  |
| **[EVALOOP: Assessing LLM Robustness in Programming from a Self-consistency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12185v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing the programming capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for their effective use in software engineering. Current evaluations, however, predominantly measure the accuracy of generated code on static benchmarks, neglecting the critical aspect of model robustness during programming tasks. While adversarial attacks offer insights on model robustness, their effectiveness is limited and evaluation could be constrained. Current adversarial attack methods for robustness evaluation yield inconsistent results, struggling to provide a unified evaluation across different LLMs. We introduce EVALOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluate the robustness from a self-consistency perspective, i.e., leveraging the natural duality inherent in popular software engineering tasks, e.g., code generation and code summarization. EVALOOP initiates a self-contained feedback loop: an LLM generates output (e.g., code) from an input (e.g., natural language specification), and then use the generated output as the input to produce a new output (e.g., summarizes that code into a new specification). EVALOOP repeats the process to assess the effectiveness of EVALOOP in each loop. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without rely on any external attack setups, providing a unified metric to evaluate LLMs' robustness in programming. We evaluate 16 prominent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.1, O4-mini) on EVALOOP and found that EVALOOP typically induces a 5.01%-19.31% absolute drop in pass@1 performance within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, GPT-3.5-Turbo, despite superior initial code generation compared to DeepSeek-V2, demonstrated lower robustness over repeated evaluation loop.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Curriculum Learning in Genetic Programming Guided Local Search for Large-scale Vehicle Routing Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15839v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manually designing (meta-)heuristics for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a challenging task that requires significant domain expertise. Recently, data-driven approaches have emerged as a promising solution, automatically learning heuristics that perform well on training instances and generalize to unseen test cases. Such an approach learns (meta-)heuristics that can perform well on the training instances, expecting it to generalize well on the unseen test instances. A recent method, named GPGLS, uses Genetic Programming (GP) to learn the utility function in Guided Local Search (GLS) and solved large scale VRP effectively. However, the selection of appropriate training instances during the learning process remains an open question, with most existing studies including GPGLS relying on random instance selection. To address this, we propose a novel method, CL-GPGLS, which integrates Curriculum Learning (CL) into GPGLS. Our approach leverages a predefined curriculum to introduce training instances progressively, starting with simpler tasks and gradually increasing complexity, enabling the model to better adapt and optimize for large-scale VRP (LSVRP). Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of CL-GPGLS, demonstrating significant performance improvements over three baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

However, this centralization exposes a single point of failure, allowing adversaries to compromise high-value assets. Existing AD defense approaches often assume static attacker behavior, but real-world adversaries adapt dynamically, rendering such methods brittle. To address this, we model attacker-defender interactions in AD as a Stackelberg game between an adaptive attacker and a proactive defender. We propose a co-evolutionary defense framework that combines Graph Neural Network Approximated Dynamic Programming (GNNDP) to model attacker strategies, with Evolutionary Diversity Optimization (EDO) to generate resilient blocking strategies. To ensure scalability, we introduce a Fixed-Parameter Tractable (FPT) graph reduction method that reduces complexity while preserving strategic structure. Our framework jointly refines attacker and defender policies to improve generalization and prevent premature convergence. Experiments on synthetic AD graphs show near-optimal results (within 0.1 percent of optimality on r500) and improved performance on larger graphs (r1000 and r2000), demonstrating the framework's scalability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalization Guarantees for Learning Branch-and-Cut Policies in Integer Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11636v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-integer programming (MIP) provides a powerful framework for optimization problems, with Branch-and-Cut (B&C) being the predominant algorithm in state-of-the-art solvers. The efficiency of B&C critically depends on heuristic policies for making sequential decisions, including node selection, cut selection, and branching variable selection. While traditional solvers often employ heuristics with manually tuned parameters, recent approaches increasingly leverage machine learning, especially neural networks, to learn these policies directly from data. A key challenge is to understand the theoretical underpinnings of these learned policies, particularly their generalization performance from finite data. This paper establishes rigorous sample complexity bounds for learning B&C policies where the scoring functions guiding each decision step (node, cut, branch) have a certain piecewise polynomial structure. This structure generalizes the linear models that form the most commonly deployed policies in practice and investigated recently in a foundational series of theoretical works by Balcan et al. Such piecewise polynomial policies also cover the neural network architectures (e.g., using ReLU activations) that have been the focal point of contemporary practical studies. Consequently, our theoretical framework closely reflects the models utilized by practitioners investigating machine learning within B&C, offering a unifying perspective relevant to both established theory and modern empirical research in this area. Furthermore, our theory applies to quite general sequential decision making problems beyond B&C.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mechanically Programming the Cross-Sectional Shape of Soft Growing Robotic Structures for Patient Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11593v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pneumatic soft everting robotic structures have the potential to facilitate human transfer tasks due to their ability to grow underneath humans without sliding friction and their utility as a flexible sling when deflated. Tubular structures naturally yield circular cross-sections when inflated, whereas a robotic sling must be both thin enough to grow between them and their resting surface and wide enough to cradle the human. Recent works have achieved flattened cross-sections by including rigid components into the structure, but this reduces conformability to the human. We present a method of mechanically programming the cross-section of soft everting robotic structures using flexible strips that constrain radial expansion between points along the outer membrane. Our method enables simultaneously wide and thin profiles while maintaining the full multi-axis flexibility of traditional slings. We develop and validate a model relating the geometric design specifications to the fabrication parameters, and experimentally characterize their effects on growth rate. Finally, we prototype a soft growing robotic sling system and demonstrate its use for assisting a single caregiver in bed-to-chair patient transfer.</p></details> |  |

However, a notable limitation of most ZC proxies is their inconsistency, as reflected by the substantial variation in their performance across different problems. Furthermore, the design of existing ZC metrics is manual, involving a time-consuming trial-and-error process that requires substantial domain expertise. These challenges raise two critical questions: (1) Can we automate the design of ZC metrics? and (2) Can we utilize the existing hand-crafted ZC metrics to synthesize a more generalizable one? In this study, we propose a framework based on Symbolic Regression via Genetic Programming to automate the design of ZC metrics. Our framework is not only highly extensible but also capable of quickly producing a ZC metric with a strong positive rank correlation to true network performance across diverse NAS search spaces and tasks. Extensive experiments on 13 problems from NAS-Bench-Suite-Zero demonstrate that our automatically generated proxies consistently outperform hand-crafted alternatives. Using our evolved proxy metric as the search objective in an evolutionary algorithm, we could identify network architectures with competitive performance within 15 minutes using a single consumer GPU.</p></details> |  |

By identifying specific issues students face, educators can provide targeted assistance to help them overcome obstacles and improve learning outcomes. While identifying sources of struggle, such as misconceptions, in real-time can be challenging in current educational practices, analyzing logical errors in students' code can offer valuable insights. This paper presents a scalable framework for automatically detecting logical errors in students' programming solutions. Our framework is based on an explainable Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) embedding model, the Subtree-based Attention Neural Network (SANN), that identifies the structural components of programs containing logical errors. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate its effectiveness, and the results suggest that our framework can accurately capture students' logical errors and, more importantly, provide us with deeper insights into their learning processes, offering a valuable tool for enhancing programming education.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 18th International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM), 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Curious Case of Class Accuracy Imbalance in LLMs: Post-hoc Debiasing via Nonlinear Integer Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07623v6)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are good knowledge bases but struggle to perform equally well for all classes in text classification. This paper investigates the case of class accuracy imbalance in LLMs, where deeply entangled pretraining biases and prompt-specific cues contribute to the imbalance. To overcome the difficulty in bias identification and inaccessibility of retraining, we post-hoc balance class accuracy using only output probabilities. This is enabled by reformulating debiasing as a combinatorial optimization problem. In details, we first motivate a post-hoc bias metric, the Contextual Oddity Bias (COBias), to quantify the over-/under-prediction (a tendency to over-predict some classes while under-predicting others) in LLMs. We then propose the Debiasing as Nonlinear Integer Programming (DNIP) method to reweight LLM output class probabilities towards minimizing COBias and max12 imizing overall accuracy, without being constrained by bias sources or updating LLM parameters. Since the DNIP model contains non-differentiable elements, we use simulated annealing to efficiently solve it. Evaluations on five LLMs across NLP classification benchmarks show that DNIP simultaneously achieves signifi16 cant COBias reduction (61% relative reduction) and accuracy improvement (18% relative increase) under different LLM prompting setups.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor Network Structure Search with Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02711v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor networks provide a powerful framework for compressing multi-dimensional data. The optimal tensor network structure for a given data tensor depends on both data characteristics and specific optimality criteria, making tensor network structure search a difficult problem. Existing solutions typically rely on sampling and compressing numerous candidate structures; these procedures are computationally expensive and therefore limiting for practical applications. We address this challenge by viewing tensor network structure search as a program synthesis problem and introducing an efficient constraint-based assessment method that avoids costly tensor decomposition. Specifically, we establish a correspondence between transformation programs and network structures. We also design a novel operation named output-directed splits to reduce the search space without hindering expressiveness. We then propose a synthesis algorithm to identify promising network candidates through constraint solving, and avoid tensor decomposition for all but the most promising candidates. Experimental results show that our approach improves search speed by up to $10\times$ and achieves compression ratios $1.5\times$ to $3\times$ better than state-of-the-art. Notably, our approach scales to larger tensors that are unattainable by prior work. Furthermore, the discovered topologies generalize well to similar data, yielding compression ratios up to $ 2.4\times$ better than a generic structure while the runtime remains around $110$ seconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Current Language Models Support Code Intelligence for R Programming Language?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07793v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in developing Pre-trained Language Models for Code (Code-PLMs) have urged many areas of Software Engineering (SE) and brought breakthrough results for many SE tasks. Though these models have achieved the state-of-the-art performance for SE tasks for many popular programming languages, such as Java and Python, the Scientific Software and its related languages like R programming language have rarely benefited or even been evaluated with the Code-PLMs. Research has shown that R has many differences with other programming languages and requires specific techniques. In this study, we provide the first insights for code intelligence for R. For this purpose, we collect and open source an R dataset, and evaluate Code-PLMs for the two tasks of code summarization and method name prediction using several settings and strategies, including the differences in two R styles, Tidy-verse and Base R. Our results demonstrate that the studied models have experienced varying degrees of performance degradation when processing R programming language code, which is supported by human evaluation. Additionally, not all models show performance improvement in R-specific tasks even after multi-language fine-tuning. The dual syntax paradigms in R significantly impact the models' performance, particularly in code summarization tasks. Furthermore, the project-specific context inherent in R codebases significantly impacts the performance when attempting cross-project training.</p></details> |  |

However, most modern integrated development environments (IDEs) have not fully adapted to this paradigm shift. For example, physical 3D objects in the real world are still represented as 2D text variables in code, creating a significant perceptual distance between these representations. In response to this challenge, we introduce SnapNCode, a novel IDE for spatial programming. SnapNCode enables programmers to capture various states of physical objects through live video streams from cameras and directly insert these visual representations into their code. Moreover, users can augment physical objects by attaching code snippets onto objects, which are opportunistically triggered when observed by cameras. We conducted a user study (N=12) to assess the usability of SnapNCode. Feedback from participants indicates that the system is easy-to-use and holds promise for daily casual uses and integration into a broader range of workflows.</p></details> | 18 pages, HCII 2025 |

It is an invaluable tool for signal processing and machine learning, because many key metrics in these fields are fractionally structured, e.g., the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in wireless communications, the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) in radar sensing, the normalized cut in graph clustering, and the margin in support vector machine (SVM). This article provides a comprehensive review of both the theory and applications of a recently developed FP technique known as the quadratic transform, which can be applied to a wide variety of FP problems, including both the minimization and the maximization of the sum of functions of ratios as well as matrix-ratio problems.</p></details> | 20 pages |

P4, a language designed for programming data-plane devices, allows developers to define custom packet processing behaviors directly on programmable network devices. This provides greater control over packet forwarding, inspection, and modification. However, the increased flexibility provided by P4 also brings significant security challenges, particularly in managing sensitive data and preventing information leakage within the data-plane. This paper presents a novel security type system for analyzing information flow in P4 programs that combines security types with interval analysis. The proposed type system allows the specification of security policies in terms of input and output packet bit fields rather than program variables. We formalize this type system and prove it sound, guaranteeing that well-typed programs satisfy noninterference. Our prototype implementation, Tap4s, is evaluated on several use cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting security violations and information leakages.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, including references and appendix.

These NP-hard problems have far-reaching applications, yet the non-convex cases have received limited attention in the literature. To address this gap, we introduce a closed-form formula for single-variable changes, establishing novel necessary and sufficient conditions for 1-Opt local improvement in UQIP and CQIP. We develop a simple local and sophisticated tabu search with an oscillation strategy tailored for large-scale problems. Experimental results on instances with up to 8000 variables demonstrate the efficiency of these strategies, producing high-quality solutions within a short time. Our approaches significantly outperform the Gurobi 11.0.2 solver.</p></details> | 39 pages, 8 figures |

They require quantum programs that define operations on quantum bits (qubits), the fundamental units of computation. Unlike traditional software development, the process of creating and debugging quantum programs requires specialized knowledge of quantum computation, making the development process more challenging. In this paper, we apply and evaluate mutation-based fault localization (MBFL) for quantum programs with the aim of enhancing debugging efficiency. We use quantum mutation operations, which are specifically designed for quantum programs, to identify faults. Our evaluation involves 23 real-world faults and 305 artificially induced faults in quantum programs developed with Qiskit(R). The results show that real-world faults are more challenging for MBFL than artificial faults. In fact, the median EXAM score, which represents the percentage of the code examined before locating the faulty statement (lower is better), is 1.2% for artificial benchmark and 19.4% for the real-world benchmark in the worst-case scenario. Our study highlights the potential and limitations of MBFL for quantum programs, considering different fault types and mutation operation types. Finally, we discuss future directions for improving MBFL in the context of quantum programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, Accepted at Short Papers, Emerging Results in the International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE), 2025</p></details> |

In its current implementation, DIDP guides the search using user-defined dual bounds. Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly being applied to combinatorial optimization problems and shares several key structures with DP, being represented by the Bellman equation and state-based transition systems. We propose using reinforcement learning to obtain a heuristic function to guide the search in DIDP. We develop two RL-based guidance approaches: value-based guidance using Deep Q-Networks and policy-based guidance using Proximal Policy Optimization. Our experiments indicate that RL-based guidance significantly outperforms standard DIDP and problem-specific greedy heuristics with the same number of node expansions. Further, despite longer node evaluation times, RL guidance achieves better run-time performance than standard DIDP on three of four benchmark domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 figures, to be published in CPAIOR 2025 (https://sites.google.com/view/cpaior2025)</p></details> |
| **[Comparing Parallel Functional Array Languages: Programming and Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08906v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parallel functional array languages are an emerging class of programming languages that promise to combine low-effort parallel programming with good performance and performance portability. We systematically compare the designs and implementations of five different functional array languages: Accelerate, APL, DaCe, Futhark, and SaC. We demonstrate the expressiveness of functional array programming by means of four challenging benchmarks, namely N-body simulation, MultiGrid, Quickhull, and Flash Attention. These benchmarks represent a range of application domains and parallel computational models. We argue that the functional array code is much shorter and more comprehensible than the hand-optimized baseline implementations because it omits architecture-specific aspects. Instead, the language implementations generate both multicore and GPU executables from a single source code base. Hence, we further argue that functional array code could more easily be ported to, and optimized for, new parallel architectures than conventional implementations of numerical kernels. We demonstrate this potential by reporting the performance of the five parallel functional array languages on a total of 39 instances of the four benchmarks on both a 32-core AMD EPYC 7313 multicore system and on an NVIDIA A30 GPU. We explore in-depth why each language performs well or not so well on each benchmark and architecture. We argue that the results demonstrate that mature functional array languages have the potential to deliver performance competitive with the best available conventional techniques.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, if a quantum party can execute a semi-quantum token scheme (Shmueli 2022) with probability of success $1/2 + \delta$, we can build powerful cryptographic primitives with a multiplicative logarithmic overhead for the desired correctness error. Our scheme makes no assumptions about the quantum party's noise model except for a simple independence requirement: noise on two sets of non-entangled hardware must be independent. Using semi-quantum tokens and oracles which can only be queried classically, we first show how to construct a "short-lived" semi-quantum one-time program (OTP) which allows a classical sending party to prepare a one-time program on the receiving party's quantum computer. We then show how to use this semi-quantum OTP to construct a semi-quantum "stateful obfuscation" scheme (which we term "RAM obfuscation"). Importantly, the RAM obfuscation scheme does not require long-term quantum memory or global entanglement. Finally, we show how RAM obfuscation can be used to build long-lived one-time programs and copy-protection schemes.</p></details> |  |

However, these applications remain insufficiently automated and struggle to effectively integrate various types of information during the programming process, including coding history, current code, and user instructions. In this work, we propose a new conversational framework that comprehensively integrates these information sources, collect data to train our models and evaluate their performance. Firstly, to thoroughly evaluate how well models align with different types of information and the quality of their outputs, we introduce a new benchmark, APEval (Assist Programming Eval), to comprehensively assess the performance of models in programming assistance tasks. Then, for data collection, we develop a data generation pipeline, Programming-Instruct, which synthesizes training data from diverse sources, such as GitHub and online judge platforms. This pipeline can automatically generate various types of messages throughout the programming process. Finally, using this pipeline, we generate 219K samples, fine-tune multiple models, and develop the CursorCore series. We show that CursorCore outperforms other models of comparable size. This framework unifies applications such as inline chat and automated editing, contributes to the advancement of coding assistants.

| **[A Quantum Constraint Generation Framework for Binary Linear Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21222v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new approach to utilize quantum computers for binary linear programming (BLP), which can be extended to general integer linear programs (ILP). Quantum optimization algorithms, hybrid or quantum-only, are currently general purpose, standalone solvers for ILP. However, to consider them practically useful, we expect them to overperform the current state of the art classical solvers. That expectation is unfair to quantum algorithms: in classical ILP solvers, after many decades of evolution, many different algorithms work together as a robust machine to get the best result. This is the approach we would like to follow now with our quantum 'solver' solutions. In this study we wrap any suitable quantum optimization algorithm into a quantum informed classical constraint generation framework. First we relax our problem by dropping all constraints and encode it into an Ising Hamiltonian for the quantum optimization subroutine. Then, by sampling from the solution state of the subroutine, we obtain information about constraint violations in the initial problem, from which we decide which coupling terms we need to introduce to the Hamiltonian. The coupling terms correspond to the constraints of the initial binary linear program. Then we optimize over the new Hamiltonian again, until we reach a feasible solution, or other stopping conditions hold. Since one can decide how many constraints they add to the Hamiltonian in a single step, our algorithm is at least as efficient as the (hybrid) quantum optimization algorithm it wraps. We support our claim with results on small scale minimum cost exact cover problem instances.</p></details> |  |

This paper examines why traditional code plagiarism detection methods frequently fail in these environments and explores the implications of emerging factors such as generative AI (genAI). Drawing on the author's experience teaching a Competitive Programming 1 (CP1) course over seven semesters at Purdue University (with $\approx 100$ students each term) and completely redesigning the CP1/2/3 course sequence, we provide an academically grounded analysis. We review literature on code plagiarism in computer science education, survey current detection tools (Moss, Kattis, etc.) and methods (manual review, code-authorship interviews), and analyze their strengths and limitations. Experience-based observations are presented to illustrate real-world detection failures and successes. We find that widely-used automated similarity checkers can be thwarted by simple code transformations or novel AI-generated code, while human-centric approaches like oral interviews, though effective, are labor-intensive. The paper concludes with opinions and preliminary recommendations for improving academic integrity in programming courses, advocating for a multi-faceted approach that combines improved detection algorithms, mastery-based learning techniques, and authentic assessment practices to better ensure code originality.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables, submitted for publication</p></details> |

An Empirical Evaluation of Generative AI as a Collaborative Teammate in a Semester-Long Classroom Setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08119v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI (GenAI), especially Large Language Models (LLMs), is rapidly reshaping both programming workflows and computer science education. Many programmers now incorporate GenAI tools into their workflows, including for collaborative coding tasks such as pair programming. While prior research has demonstrated the benefits of traditional pair programming and begun to explore GenAI-assisted coding, the role of LLM-based tools as collaborators in pair programming remains underexamined. In this work, we conducted a mixed-methods study with 39 undergraduate students to examine how GenAI influences collaboration, learning, and performance in pair programming. Specifically, students completed six in-class assignments under three conditions: Traditional Pair Programming (PP), Pair Programming with GenAI (PAI), and Solo Programming with GenAI (SAI). They used both LLM-based inline completion tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) and LLM-based conversational tools (e.g., ChatGPT). Our results show that students in PAI achieved the highest assignment scores, whereas those in SAI attained the lowest. Additionally, students' attitudes toward LLMs' programming capabilities improved significantly after collaborating with LLM-based tools, and preferences were largely shaped by the perceived usefulness for completing assignments and learning programming skills, as well as the quality of collaboration. Our qualitative findings further reveal that while students appreciated LLM-based tools as valuable pair programming partners, they also identified limitations and had different expectations compared to human teammates. Our study provides one of the first empirical evaluations of GenAI as a pair programming collaborator through a comparison of three conditions (PP, PAI, and SAI). We also discuss the design implications and pedagogical considerations for future GenAI-assisted pair programming approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Learning @ Scale 2025</p></details> |

The Clarke subdifferential and surrogate functions are not readily obtainable due to the latent decision dependency. To deal with such a computational difficulty, we develop an adaptive learning-based surrogate method that integrates the simulation scheme and statistical estimates to construct estimation-based surrogate functions in a way that the simulation process is adaptively guided by the algorithmic procedure. We establish the non-asymptotic convergence rate analysis in terms of $(\nu, \delta)$-near stationarity in expectation under variable proximal parameters and batch sizes, which exhibits the superior convergence performance and enhanced stability in both theory and practice. We provide numerical results with both synthetic and real data which illustrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm in terms of algorithmic stability and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATiM: Autotuning Tensor Programs for Processing-in-DRAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19630v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Processing-in-DRAM (DRAM-PIM) has emerged as a promising technology for accelerating memory-intensive operations in modern applications, such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its potential, current software stacks for DRAM-PIM face significant challenges, including reliance on hand-tuned libraries that hinder programmability, limited support for high-level abstractions, and the lack of systematic optimization frameworks. To address these limitations, we present ATiM, a search-based optimizing tensor compiler for UPMEM. Key features of ATiM include: (1) automated searches of the joint search space for host and kernel tensor programs, (2) PIM-aware optimizations for efficiently handling boundary conditions, and (3) improved search algorithms for the expanded search space of UPMEM systems. Our experimental results on UPMEM hardware demonstrate performance gains of up to 6.18$\times$ for various UPMEM benchmark kernels and 8.21$\times$ for GPT-J layers. To the best of our knowledge, ATiM is the first tensor compiler to provide fully automated, autotuning-integrated code generation support for a DRAM-PIM system. By bridging the gap between high-level tensor computation abstractions and low-level hardware-specific requirements, ATiM establishes a foundation for advancing DRAM-PIM programmability and enabling streamlined optimization.</p></details> | 17 pages, 15 figures |

Many important quantum algorithms are built upon oracle quantum programs, making it essential to ensure their correctness during development. While software testing is a well-established approach for improving program reliability, no systematic method has been developed to test oracle quantum programs. This paper proposes a black-box testing framework designed for general oracle quantum programs. We define these programs formally, establish the foundational theory for their testing, and propose a detailed testing framework. We develop a prototype tool and conduct extensive experimental evaluations to evaluate the framework's effectiveness. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly aids developers in testing oracle quantum programs, providing insights to enhance the reliability of quantum software.</p></details> | 35 pages, 8 figures |

In particular, we are interested in a subclass of POMDPs wherein the components of the model, including the observation function, reward function, transition function, and initial state distribution function, can be modeled as low-complexity probabilistic graphical models in the form of a short probabilistic program. Our strategy to learn these programs uses an LLM as a prior, generating candidate probabilistic programs that are then tested against the empirical distribution and adjusted through feedback. We experiment on a number of classical toy POMDP problems, simulated MiniGrid domains, and two real mobile-base robotics search domains involving partial observability. Our results show that using an LLM to guide in the construction of a low-complexity POMDP model can be more effective than tabular POMDP learning, behavior cloning, or direct LLM planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crypto-Economic Analysis of Web3 Funding Programs Using the Grant Maturity Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06801v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web3 grant programs are evolving mechanisms aimed at supporting innovation within the blockchain ecosystem, yet little is known on about their effectiveness. This paper proposes the concept of maturity to fill this gap and introduces the Grant Maturity Framework (GMF), a mixed-methods model for evaluating the maturity of Web3 grant programs. The GMF provides a systematic approach to assessing the structure, governance, and impact of Web3 grants, applied here to four prominent Ethereum layer-two (L2) grant programs: Arbitrum, Optimism, Mantle, and Taiko. By evaluating these programs using the GMF, the study categorizes them into four maturity stages, ranging from experimental to advanced. The findings reveal that Arbitrum's Long-Term Incentive Pilot Program (LTIPP) and Optimism's Mission Rounds show higher maturity, while Mantle and Taiko are still in their early stages. The research concludes by discussing the user-centric development of a Web3 grant management platform aimed at improving the maturity and effectiveness of Web3 grant management processes based on the findings from the GMF. This work contributes to both practical and theoretical knowledge on Web3 grant program evaluation and tooling, providing a valuable resource for Web3 grant operators and stakeholders.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Collaborative Conversational Agent System Based on LLMs and Answer Set Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06438v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the Large-Language-Model-driven (LLM-driven) Artificial Intelligence (AI) bots became popular, people realized their strong potential in Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD). However, bots relying wholly on LLMs are unreliable in their knowledge, and whether they can finally produce a correct result for the task is not guaranteed. The collaboration among these agents also remains a challenge, since the necessary information to convey is unclear, and the information transfer is by prompts -- unreliable, and malicious knowledge is easy to inject. With the help of logic programming tools such as Answer Set Programming (ASP), conversational agents can be built safely and reliably, and communication among the agents made more efficient and secure. We proposed an Administrator-Assistant Dual-Agent paradigm, where the two ASP-driven bots share the same knowledge base and complete their tasks independently, while the information can be passed by a Collaborative Rule Set (CRS). The knowledge and information conveyed are encapsulated and invisible to the users, ensuring the security of information transmission. We have constructed AutoManager, a dual-agent system for managing the drive-through window of a fast-food restaurant such as Taco Bell in the US. In AutoManager, the assistant bot takes the customer's order while the administrator bot manages the menu and food supply. We evaluated our AutoManager and compared it with the real-world Taco Bell Drive-Thru AI Order Taker, and the results show that our method is more reliable.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[From Observation to Orientation: an Adaptive Integer Programming Approach to Intervention Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03122v3)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using both observational and experimental data, a causal discovery process can identify the causal relationships between variables. A unique adaptive intervention design paradigm is presented in this work, where causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are for effectively recovered with practical budgetary considerations. In order to choose treatments that optimize information gain under these considerations, an iterative integer programming (IP) approach is proposed, which drastically reduces the number of experiments required. Simulations over a broad range of graph sizes and edge densities are used to assess the effectiveness of the suggested approach. Results show that the proposed adaptive IP approach achieves full causal graph recovery with fewer intervention iterations and variable manipulations than random intervention baselines, and it is also flexible enough to accommodate a variety of practical constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[JustinANN: Realistic Test Generation for Java Programs Driven by Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05715v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated test case generation is important. However, the automatically generated test input does not always make sense, and the automated assertion is difficult to validate against the program under test. In this paper, we propose JustinANN, a flexible and scalable tool to generate test cases for Java programs, providing realistic test inputs and assertions. We have observed that, in practice, Java programs contain a large number of annotations from programs, which can be considered as part of the user specification. We design a systematic annotation set with 7 kinds of annotations and 4 combination rules based on them to modify complex Java objects. Annotations that modify the fields or return variables of methods can be used to generate assertions that represent the true intent of the program, and the ones that modify the input parameters can be used to generate test inputs that match the real business requirement. We have conducted experiments to evaluate the approach on open source Java programs. The results show that the annotations and their combinations designed in this paper are compatible with existing annotations; our approach is easier to generate test data in, on and outside the boundaries of the requirement domain; and it also helps to find program defects.</p></details> |  |
| **[ICNN-enhanced 2SP: Leveraging input convex neural networks for solving two-stage stochastic programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05261v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-stage stochastic programming (2SP) offers a basic framework for modelling decision-making under uncertainty, yet scalability remains a challenge due to the computational complexity of recourse function evaluation. Existing learning-based methods like Neural Two-Stage Stochastic Programming (Neur2SP) employ neural networks (NNs) as recourse function surrogates but rely on computationally intensive mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations. We propose ICNN-enhanced 2SP, a method that leverages Input Convex Neural Networks (ICNNs) to exploit linear programming (LP) representability in convex 2SP problems. By architecturally enforcing convexity and enabling exact inference through LP, our approach eliminates the need for integer variables inherent to the conventional MIP-based formulation while retaining an exact embedding of the ICNN surrogate within the 2SP framework. This results in a more computationally efficient alternative that maintains solution quality. Comprehensive experiments reveal that ICNNs incur only marginally longer training times while achieving validation accuracy on par with their MIP-based counterparts. Across benchmark problems, ICNN-enhanced 2SP often exhibits considerably faster solution times than the MIP-based formulations while preserving solution quality, with these advantages becoming significantly more pronounced as problem scale increases. For the most challenging instances, the method achieves speedups of up to 100$\times$ and solution quality superior to MIP-based formulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Pathways to Program Success: Hopfield Networks for PERT Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05047v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Project and task scheduling under uncertainty remains a fundamental challenge in program and project management, where accurate estimation of task durations and dependencies is critical for delivering complex, multi project systems. The Program Evaluation and Review Technique provides a probabilistic framework to model task variability and critical paths. In this paper, the author presents a novel formulation of PERT scheduling as an energy minimization problem within a Hopfield neural network architecture. By mapping task start times and precedence constraints into a neural computation framework, the networks inherent optimization dynamics is exploited to approximate globally consistent schedules. The author addresses key theoretical issues related to energy function differentiability, constraint encoding, and convergence, and extends the Hopfield model for structured precedence graphs. Numerical simulations on synthetic project networks comprising up to 1000 tasks demonstrate the viability of this approach, achieving near optimal makespans with minimal constraint violations. The findings suggest that neural optimization models offer a promising direction for scalable and adaptive project tasks scheduling under uncertainty in areas such as the agentic AI workflows, microservice based applications that the modern AI systems are being built upon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Facilitating Instructors-LLM Collaboration for Problem Design in Introductory Programming Classrooms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01259v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, offer significant opportunities to enhance instructional support in introductory programming courses. While extensive research has explored the effectiveness of LLMs in supporting student learning, limited studies have examined how these models can assist instructors in designing instructional activities. This work investigates how instructors' expertise in effective activity design can be integrated with LLMs' ability to generate novel and targeted programming problems, facilitating more effective activity creation for programming classrooms. To achieve this, we employ a participatory design approach to develop an instructor-authoring tool that incorporates LLM support, fostering collaboration between instructors and AI in generating programming exercises. This tool also allows instructors to specify common student mistakes and misconceptions, which informs the adaptive feedback generation process. We conduct case studies with three instructors, analyzing how they use our system to design programming problems for their introductory courses. Through these case studies, we assess instructors' perceptions of the usefulness and limitations of LLMs in authoring problem statements for instructional purposes. Additionally, we compare the efficiency, quality, effectiveness, and coverage of designed activities when instructors create problems with and without structured LLM prompting guidelines. Our findings provide insights into the potential of LLMs in enhancing instructor workflows and improving programming education and provide guidelines for designing effective AI-assisted problem-authoring interfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CHI 2025 Workshop on Augmented Educators and AI: Shaping the Future of Human and AI Cooperation in Learning</p></details> |
