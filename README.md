These code suggestions are mostly for calling a method of an object or for using a function of a library and not for possible next line of the code. GPT based models are too slow or resource intensive for real-time code suggestions in local environments. As a solution to this GraphSense was introduced which provide code suggestions with minimum amount of resource usage in real-time.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages and 10 figures</p></details> |
| **[CAD-Recode: Reverse Engineering CAD Code from Point Clouds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14042v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-Aided Design (CAD) models are typically constructed by sequentially drawing parametric sketches and applying CAD operations to obtain a 3D model. The problem of 3D CAD reverse engineering consists of reconstructing the sketch and CAD operation sequences from 3D representations such as point clouds. In this paper, we address this challenge through novel contributions across three levels: CAD sequence representation, network design, and training dataset. In particular, we represent CAD sketch-extrude sequences as Python code. The proposed CAD-Recode translates a point cloud into Python code that, when executed, reconstructs the CAD model. Taking advantage of the exposure of pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs) to Python code, we leverage a relatively small LLM as a decoder for CAD-Recode and combine it with a lightweight point cloud projector. CAD-Recode is trained on a procedurally generated dataset of one million CAD sequences. CAD-Recode significantly outperforms existing methods across the DeepCAD, Fusion360 and real-world CC3D datasets. Furthermore, we show that our CAD Python code output is interpretable by off-the-shelf LLMs, enabling CAD editing and CAD-specific question answering from point clouds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inferring Input Grammars from Code with Symbolic Parsing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08486v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating effective test inputs for a software system requires that these inputs be valid, as they will otherwise be rejected without reaching actual functionality. In the absence of a specification for the input language, common test generation techniques rely on sample inputs, which are abstracted into matching grammars and/or evolved guided by test coverage. However, if sample inputs miss features of the input language, the chances of generating these features randomly are slim. In this work, we present the first technique for symbolically and automatically mining input grammars from the code of recursive descent parsers. So far, the complexity of parsers has made such a symbolic analysis challenging to impossible. Our realization of the symbolic parsing technique overcomes these challenges by (1) associating each parser function parse_ELEM() with a nonterminal <ELEM>; (2) limiting recursive calls and loop iterations, such that a symbolic analysis of parse_ELEM() needs to consider only a finite number of paths; and (3) for each path, create an expansion alternative for <ELEM>. Being purely static, symbolic parsing does not require seed inputs; as it mitigates path explosion, it scales to complex parsers. Our evaluation promises symbolic parsing to be highly accurate. Applied on parsers for complex languages such as TINY-C or JSON, our STALAGMITE implementation extracts grammars with an accuracy of 99--100%, widely improving over the state of the art despite requiring only the program code and no input samples. The resulting grammars cover the entire input space, allowing for comprehensive and effective test generation, reverse engineering, and documentation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Investigating Execution-Aware Language Models for Code Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08228v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code optimization is the process of enhancing code efficiency, while preserving its intended functionality. This process often requires a deep understanding of the code execution behavior at run-time to identify and address inefficiencies effectively. Recent studies have shown that language models can play a significant role in automating code optimization. However, these models may have insufficient knowledge of how code execute at run-time. To address this limitation, researchers have developed strategies that integrate code execution information into language models. These strategies have shown promise, enhancing the effectiveness of language models in various software engineering tasks. However, despite the close relationship between code execution behavior and efficiency, the specific impact of these strategies on code optimization remains largely unexplored. This study investigates how incorporating code execution information into language models affects their ability to optimize code. Specifically, we apply three different training strategies to incorporate four code execution aspects -- line executions, line coverage, branch coverage, and variable states -- into CodeT5+, a well-known language model for code. Our results indicate that execution-aware models provide limited benefits compared to the standard CodeT5+ model in optimizing code.</p></details> |  |
| **[OASIS: Order-Augmented Strategy for Improved Code Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.08161v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code embeddings capture the semantic representations of code and are crucial for various code-related large language model (LLM) applications, such as code search. Previous training primarily relies on optimizing the InfoNCE loss by comparing positive natural language (NL)-code pairs with in-batch negatives. However, due to the sparse nature of code contexts, training solely by comparing the major differences between positive and negative pairs may fail to capture deeper semantic nuances. To address this issue, we propose a novel order-augmented strategy for improved code search (OASIS). It leverages order-based similarity labels to train models to capture subtle differences in similarity among negative pairs. Extensive benchmark evaluations demonstrate that our OASIS model significantly outperforms previous state-of-the-art models focusing solely on major positive-negative differences. It underscores the value of exploiting subtle differences among negative pairs with order labels for effective code embedding training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Multilingual Language Models for Code-Switched Input Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07990v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code-switching, or alternating between languages within a single conversation, presents challenges for multilingual language models on NLP tasks. This research investigates if pre-training Multilingual BERT (mBERT) on code-switched datasets improves the model's performance on critical NLP tasks such as part of speech tagging, sentiment analysis, named entity recognition, and language identification. We use a dataset of Spanglish tweets for pre-training and evaluate the pre-trained model against a baseline model. Our findings show that our pre-trained mBERT model outperforms or matches the baseline model in the given tasks, with the most significant improvements seen for parts of speech tagging. Additionally, our latent analysis uncovers more homogenous English and Spanish embeddings for language identification tasks, providing insights for future modeling work. This research highlights potential for adapting multilingual LMs for code-switched input data in order for advanced utility in globalized and multilingual contexts. Future work includes extending experiments to other language pairs, incorporating multiform data, and exploring methods for better understanding context-dependent code-switches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code Digital Twin: Empowering LLMs with Tacit Knowledge for Complex Software Maintenance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07967v1)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated promise in software engineering tasks like code completion and generation, their support for the maintenance of complex software systems remains limited. These models often struggle with understanding the tacit knowledge embedded in systems, such as responsibility allocation and collaboration across different modules. To address this gap, we introduce the concept and framework of \textbf{Code Digital Twin}, a conceptual representation of tacit knowledge that captures the concepts, functionalities, and design rationales behind code elements, co-evolving with the software. A code digital twin is constructed using a methodology that combines knowledge extraction from both structured and unstructured sources--such as source code, documentation, and change histories--leveraging LLMs, static analysis tools, and human expertise. This framework can empower LLMs for software maintenance tasks such as issue localization and repository-level code generation by providing tacit knowledge as contexts. Based on the proposed methodology, we explore the key challenges and opportunities involved in the continuous construction and refinement of code digital twin.</p></details> | <details><summary>A vis...</summary><p>A vision paper that will be continuously updated</p></details> |
| **[LTLCodeGen: Code Generation of Syntactically Correct Temporal Logic for Robot Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07902v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on planning robot navigation tasks from natural language specifications. We develop a modular approach, where a large language model (LLM) translates the natural language instructions into a linear temporal logic (LTL) formula with propositions defined by object classes in a semantic occupancy map. The LTL formula and the semantic occupancy map are provided to a motion planning algorithm to generate a collision-free robot path that satisfies the natural language instructions. Our main contribution is LTLCodeGen, a method to translate natural language to syntactically correct LTL using code generation. We demonstrate the complete task planning method in real-world experiments involving human speech to provide navigation instructions to a mobile robot. We also thoroughly evaluate our approach in simulated and real-world experiments in comparison to end-to-end LLM task planning and state-of-the-art LLM-to-LTL translation methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantifying Overfitting along the Regularization Path for Two-Part-Code MDL in Supervised Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02110v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We provide a complete characterization of the entire regularization curve of a modified two-part-code Minimum Description Length (MDL) learning rule for binary classification, based on an arbitrary prior or description language. Grunwald and Langford [2004] previously established the lack of asymptotic consistency, from an agnostic PAC (frequentist worst case) perspective, of the MDL rule with a penalty parameter of $\lambda=1$, suggesting that it underegularizes. Driven by interest in understanding how benign or catastrophic under-regularization and overfitting might be, we obtain a precise quantitative description of the worst case limiting error as a function of the regularization parameter $\lambda$ and noise level (or approximation error), significantly tightening the analysis of Grunwald and Langford for $\lambda=1$ and extending it to all other choices of $\lambda$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Personalized Code Readability Assessment: Are We There Yet?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07870v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unreadable code could be a breeding ground for errors. Thus, previous work defined approaches based on machine learning to automatically assess code readability that can warn developers when some code artifacts (e.g., classes) become unreadable. Given datasets of code snippets manually evaluated by several developers in terms of their perceived readability, such approaches (i) establish a snippet-level ground truth, and (ii) train a binary (readable/unreadable) or a ternary (readable/neutral/unreadable) code readability classifier. Given this procedure, all existing approaches neglect the subjectiveness of code readability, i.e., the possible different developer-specific nuances in the code readability perception. In this paper, we aim to understand to what extent it is possible to assess code readability as subjectively perceived by developers through a personalized code readability assessment approach. This problem is significantly more challenging than the snippet-level classification problem: We assume that, in a realistic scenario, a given developer is keen to provide only a few code readability evaluations, thus less data is available. For this reason, we adopt an LLM with few-shot learning to achieve our goal. Our results, however, show that such an approach achieves worse results than a state-of-the-art feature-based model that is trained to work at the snippet-level. We tried to understand why this happens by looking more closely at the quality of the available code readability datasets and assessed the consistency of the inter-developer evaluations. We observed that up to a third of the evaluations are self-contradictory. Our negative results call for new and more reliable code readability datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[RefactorBench: Evaluating Stateful Reasoning in Language Agents Through Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07832v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in language model (LM) agents and function calling have enabled autonomous, feedback-driven systems to solve problems across various digital domains. To better understand the unique limitations of LM agents, we introduce RefactorBench, a benchmark consisting of 100 large handcrafted multi-file refactoring tasks in popular open-source repositories. Solving tasks within RefactorBench requires thorough exploration of dependencies across multiple files and strong adherence to relevant instructions. Every task is defined by 3 natural language instructions of varying specificity and is mutually exclusive, allowing for the creation of longer combined tasks on the same repository. Baselines on RefactorBench reveal that current LM agents struggle with simple compositional tasks, solving only 22% of tasks with base instructions, in contrast to a human developer with short time constraints solving 87%. Through trajectory analysis, we identify various unique failure modes of LM agents, and further explore the failure mode of tracking past actions. By adapting a baseline agent to condition on representations of state, we achieve a 43.9% improvement in solving RefactorBench tasks. We further extend our state-aware approach to encompass entire digital environments and outline potential directions for future research. RefactorBench aims to support the study of LM agents by providing a set of real-world, multi-hop tasks within the realm of code.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |
| **[Simultaneous Decoding of Classical Coset Codes over $3-$User Quantum Interference Channel : New Achievable Rate Regions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07804v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We undertake a Shannon theoretic study of the problem of communicating classical information over a $3-$user quantum interference channel (QIC) and focus on characterizing inner bounds. In our previous work, we had demonstrated that coding strategies based on coset codes can yield strictly larger inner bounds. Adopting the powerful technique of \textit{tilting}, \textit{smoothing} and \textit{augmentation} discovered by Sen recently, and combining with our coset code strategy we derive a new inner bound to the classical-quantum capacity region of a $3-$user QIC. The derived inner bound subsumes all current known bounds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Theoretical Analysis of Multi-coding with Non-orthogonal Signaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07765v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Even though orthogonal multi-code signaling and its derivative, simplex signaling, are well known and widely used in different communication systems, certain applications may choose to adopt non-orthogonal signaling to benefit from other advantages that such signaling methods can offer. Motivated by a class of multi-carrier spread spectrum systems, this paper presents a thorough symbol error rate analysis of the broad class of multi-code signaling methods when they make use of codes which are not necessarily orthogonal. Our analysis is also extended to the case where the code set includes the negative of each code vector, i.e., an extension to biorthogonal signaling. Moreover, it is shown that the symbol error rate results derived in this paper reduce to those available in the literature when the multi-codes are orthogonal or satisfy the correlation property of simplex multi-codes.</p></details> | 10 pages, 4 figures |
| **[IterPref: Focal Preference Learning for Code Generation via Iterative Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02783v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference learning enhances Code LLMs beyond supervised fine-tuning by leveraging relative quality comparisons. Existing methods construct preference pairs from candidates based on test case success, treating the higher pass rate sample as positive and the lower as negative. However, this approach does not pinpoint specific errors in the code, which prevents the model from learning more informative error correction patterns, as aligning failing code as a whole lacks the granularity needed to capture meaningful error-resolution relationships. To address these issues, we propose IterPref, a new preference alignment framework that mimics human iterative debugging to refine Code LLMs. IterPref explicitly locates error regions and aligns the corresponding tokens via a tailored DPO algorithm. To generate informative pairs, we introduce the CodeFlow dataset, where samples are iteratively refined until passing tests, with modifications capturing error corrections. Extensive experiments show that a diverse suite of Code LLMs equipped with IterPref achieves significant performance gains in code generation and improves on challenging tasks like BigCodeBench. In-depth analysis reveals that IterPref yields fewer errors. Our code and data will be made publicaly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code and data will be released soon</p></details> |
| **[Automated Benchmark Generation for Repository-Level Coding Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07701v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code Agent development is an extremely active research area, where a reliable performance metric is critical for tracking progress and guiding new developments. This demand is underscored by the meteoric rise in popularity of SWE-Bench. This benchmark challenges code agents to generate patches addressing GitHub issues given the full repository as context. The correctness of generated patches is then evaluated by executing a human-written test suite extracted from the repository after the issue's resolution. However, constructing benchmarks like SWE-Bench requires substantial manual effort to set up historically accurate execution environments for testing. Crucially, this severely limits the number of considered repositories, e.g., just 12 for SWE-Bench. Considering so few repositories, selected for their popularity runs the risk of leading to a distributional mismatch, i.e., the measured performance may not be representative of real-world scenarios potentially misguiding development efforts. In this work, we address this challenge and introduce SetUpAgent, a fully automated system capable of historically accurate dependency setup, test execution, and result parsing. Using SetUpAgent, we generate two new datasets: (i) SWEE-Bench an extended version of SWE-Bench encompassing hundreds of repositories, and (ii) SWA-Bench a benchmark focusing on applications rather than libraries. Comparing these datasets to SWE-Bench with respect to their characteristics and code agent performance, we find significant distributional differences, including lower issue description quality and detail level, higher fix complexity, and most importantly up to 40% lower agent success rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at DL4C@ICLR'25 and FMWild@ICLR'25</p></details> |
| **[TaskEval: Assessing Difficulty of Code Generation Tasks for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21227v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in code-related tasks like code generation, but benchmark evaluations often overlook task characteristics, such as difficulty. Moreover, benchmarks are usually built using tasks described with one single prompt, despite the formulation of prompts having a profound impact on the outcome. This paper introduces a generalist approach, TaskEval, a framework using diverse prompts and Item Response Theory (IRT) to efficiently assess LLMs' capabilities and benchmark task characteristics, improving the understanding of their performance. Using two code generation benchmarks, HumanEval+ and ClassEval, as well as 5 code generation LLMs, we show that TaskEval is capable of characterizing the properties of tasks. Using topic analysis, we identify and analyze the tasks of respectively 17 and 21 topics within the benchmarks. We also cross-analyze tasks' characteristics with programming constructs (e.g., variable assignment, conditions, etc.) used by LLMs, emphasizing some patterns with tasks' difficulty. Finally, we conduct a comparison between the difficulty assessment of tasks by human-annotators and LLMs. Orthogonal to current benchmarking evaluation efforts, TaskEval can assist researchers and practitioners in fostering better assessments of LLMs. The tasks' characteristics can be used to identify shortcomings within existing benchmarks. This could be used to generate additional related tasks for the evaluation or improvement of LLM.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Minimum Distances of Finite-Length Lifted Product Quantum LDPC Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07567v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum error correction (QEC) is critical for practical realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing, and recently proposed families of quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) code are prime candidates for advanced QEC hardware architectures and implementations. This paper focuses on the finite-length QLDPC code design criteria, specifically aimed at constructing degenerate quasi-cyclic symmetric lifted-product (LP-QLDPC) codes. We describe the necessary conditions such that the designed LP-QLDPC codes are guaranteed to have a minimum distance strictly greater than the minimum weight stabilizer generators, ensuring superior error correction performance on quantum channels. The focus is on LP-QLDPC codes built from quasi-cyclic base codes belonging to the class of type-I protographs, and the necessary constraints are efficiently expressed in terms of the row and column indices of the base code. Specifically, we characterize the combinatorial constraints on the classical quasi-cyclic base matrices that guarantee construction of degenerate LP-QLDPC codes. Minimal examples and illustrations are provided to demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of the code construction approach. The row and column partition constraints derived in the paper simplify the design of degenerate LP-QLDPC codes and can be incorporated into existing classical and quantum code design approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, Submitted to TQC 2025</p></details> |
| **[RepoST: Scalable Repository-Level Coding Environment Construction with Sandbox Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07358v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present RepoST, a scalable method to construct environments that provide execution feedback for repository-level code generation for both training and evaluation. Unlike existing works that aim to build entire repositories for execution, which is challenging for both human and LLMs, we provide execution feedback with sandbox testing, which isolates a given target function and its dependencies to a separate script for testing. Sandbox testing reduces the complexity of external dependencies and enables constructing environments at a large scale. We use our method to construct RepoST-Train, a large-scale train set with 7,415 functions from 832 repositories. Training with the execution feedback provided by RepoST-Train leads to a performance gain of 5.5% Pass@1 on HumanEval and 3.5% Pass@1 on RepoEval. We also build an evaluation dataset, RepoST-Eval, and benchmark 12 code generation models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond the Edge of Function: Unraveling the Patterns of Type Recovery in Binary Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07243v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Type recovery is a crucial step in binary code analysis, holding significant importance for reverse engineering and various security applications. Existing works typically simply target type identifiers within binary code and achieve type recovery by analyzing variable characteristics within functions. However, we find that the types in real-world binary programs are more complex and often follow specific distribution patterns. In this paper, to gain a profound understanding of the variable type recovery problem in binary code, we first conduct a comprehensive empirical study. We utilize the TYDA dataset, which includes 163,643 binary programs across four architectures and four compiler optimization options, fully reflecting the complexity and diversity of real-world programs. We carefully study the unique patterns that characterize types and variables in binary code, and also investigate the impact of compiler optimizations on them, yielding many valuable insights. Based on our empirical findings, we propose ByteTR, a framework for recovering variable types in binary code. We decouple the target type set to address the issue of unbalanced type distribution and perform static program analysis to tackle the impact of compiler optimizations on variable storage. In light of the ubiquity of variable propagation across functions observed in our study, ByteTR conducts inter-procedural analysis to trace variable propagation and employs a gated graph neural network to capture long-range data flow dependencies for variable type recovery. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the performance of ByteTR. The results demonstrate that ByteTR leads state-of-the-art works in both effectiveness and efficiency. Moreover, in real CTF challenge case, the pseudo code optimized by ByteTR significantly improves readability, surpassing leading tools IDA and Ghidra.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Android Malware Detection and Malicious Code Localization Using Graph Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07109v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the escalating threat of malware, particularly on mobile devices, the demand for effective analysis methods has never been higher. While existing security solutions, including AI-based approaches, offer promise, their lack of transparency constraints the understanding of detected threats. Manual analysis remains time-consuming and reliant on scarce expertise. To address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called XAIDroid that leverages graph neural networks (GNNs) and graph attention mechanisms for automatically locating malicious code snippets within malware. By representing code as API call graphs, XAIDroid captures semantic context and enhances resilience against obfuscation. Utilizing the Graph Attention Model (GAM) and Graph Attention Network (GAT), we assign importance scores to API nodes, facilitating focused attention on critical information for malicious code localization. Evaluation on synthetic and real-world malware datasets demonstrates the efficacy of our approach, achieving high recall and F1-score rates for malicious code localization. The successful implementation of automatic malicious code localization enhances the scalability, interpretability, and reliability of malware analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has 13 pages and contains 5 images (3 figures within the paper and 2 author photos).

| **[Quantizing Large Language Models for Code Generation: A Differentiated Replication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07103v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown an impressive capability in code generation and, specifically, to automatically implement requirements described in natural language. The LLM effectiveness generally increases with its size: The higher the number of LLM's trainable parameters the better its ability to implement code. However, when it comes to deploying LLM-based code generators, larger LLMs pose significant challenges related to their memory (and, consequently, carbon) footprint. A previous work by Wei et al. proposed to leverage quantization techniques to reduce the memory footprint of LLM-based code generators without substantially degrading their effectiveness. In short, they studied LLMs featuring up to 16B parameters, quantizing their precision from floating point 32 bits down to int 8 bits and showing their limited impact on code generation performance. Given the fast pace at which LLM capabilities and quantization techniques are evolving, in this work we present a differentiated replication of the work by Wei et al. in which we consider (i) on the one side, more recent and larger code-related LLMs, of up to 34B parameters; (ii) the latest advancements in model quantization techniques, which allow pushing the compression to the extreme quantization level of 2 bits per model parameter and; (iii) different types of calibration datasets to guide the quantization process, including code-specific ones. Our empirical evaluation reveals that the new frontier for LLM quantization is 4-bit precision, resulting in an average memory footprint reduction of 70% compared to the original model without observing any significant decrease in performance. Additionally, when the quantization becomes even more extreme (3 and 2 bits), a code-specific calibration dataset helps to limit the loss of performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoIR: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Code Information Retrieval Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.02883v2)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the substantial success of Information Retrieval (IR) in various NLP tasks, most IR systems predominantly handle queries and corpora in natural language, neglecting the domain of code retrieval. Code retrieval is critically important yet remains under-explored, with existing methods and benchmarks inadequately representing the diversity of code in various domains and tasks. Addressing this gap, we present COIR (Code Information Retrieval Benchmark), a robust and comprehensive benchmark specifically designed to assess code retrieval capabilities. COIR comprises ten meticulously curated code datasets, spanning eight distinctive retrieval tasks across seven diverse domains. We first discuss the construction of COIR and its diverse dataset composition. Further, we evaluate nine widely used retrieval models using COIR, uncovering significant difficulties in performing code retrieval tasks even with state-of-the-art systems. To facilitate easy adoption and integration within existing research workflows, COIR has been developed as a user-friendly Python framework, readily installable via pip. It shares same data schema as other popular benchmarks like MTEB and BEIR, enabling seamless cross-benchmark evaluations. Through COIR, we aim to invigorate research in the code retrieval domain, providing a versatile benchmarking tool that encourages further development and exploration of code retrieval systems https://github.com/CoIR-team/coir.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProjectEval: A Benchmark for Programming Agents Automated Evaluation on Project-Level Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07010v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, LLM agents have made rapid progress in improving their programming capabilities. However, existing benchmarks lack the ability to automatically evaluate from users' perspective, and also lack the explainability of the results of LLM agents' code generation capabilities. Thus, we introduce ProjectEval, a new benchmark for LLM agents project-level code generation's automated evaluation by simulating user interaction. ProjectEval is constructed by LLM with human reviewing. It has three different level inputs of natural languages or code skeletons. ProjectEval can evaluate the generated projects by user interaction simulation for execution, and by code similarity through existing objective indicators. Through ProjectEval, we find that systematic engineering project code, overall understanding of the project and comprehensive analysis capability are the keys for LLM agents to achieve practical projects. Our findings and benchmark provide valuable insights for developing more effective programming agents that can be deployed in future real-world production.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages (9 Appendix pages), 4 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Code Generation: LLM-supported Exploration of the Program Design Space](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06911v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we explore explicit Large Language Model (LLM)-powered support for the iterative design of computer programs. Program design, like other design activity, is characterized by navigating a space of alternative problem formulations and associated solutions in an iterative fashion. LLMs are potentially powerful tools in helping this exploration; however, by default, code-generation LLMs deliver code that represents a particular point solution. This obscures the larger space of possible alternatives, many of which might be preferable to the LLM's default interpretation and its generated code. We contribute an IDE that supports program design through generating and showing new ways to frame problems alongside alternative solutions, tracking design decisions, and identifying implicit decisions made by either the programmer or the LLM. In a user study, we find that with our IDE, users combine and parallelize design phases to explore a broader design space -- but also struggle to keep up with LLM-originated changes to code and other information overload. These findings suggest a core challenge for future IDEs that support program design through higher-level instructions given to LLM-based agents: carefully managing attention and deciding what information agents should surface to program designers and when.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; 4 figures; 1 table; to appear in CHI '25</p></details> |
| **[AutoMisty: A Multi-Agent LLM Framework for Automated Code Generation in the Misty Social Robot](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06791v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The social robot's open API allows users to customize open-domain interactions. However, it remains inaccessible to those without programming experience. In this work, we introduce AutoMisty, the first multi-agent collaboration framework powered by large language models (LLMs), to enable the seamless generation of executable Misty robot code from natural language instructions. AutoMisty incorporates four specialized agent modules to manage task decomposition, assignment, problem-solving, and result synthesis. Each agent incorporates a two-layer optimization mechanism, with self-reflection for iterative refinement and human-in-the-loop for better alignment with user preferences. AutoMisty ensures a transparent reasoning process, allowing users to iteratively refine tasks through natural language feedback for precise execution. To evaluate AutoMisty's effectiveness, we designed a benchmark task set spanning four levels of complexity and conducted experiments in a real Misty robot environment.

| **[SABER: Model-agnostic Backdoor Attack on Chain-of-Thought in Neural Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05829v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have proposed integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to further enhance the reliability of Code Language Models (CLMs) in generating code, a step-by-step approach that breaks down complex programming tasks into manageable sub-problems. Advances in this area have introduced CoT models, specifically designed to integrate CoT reasoning effectively into language models, achieving notable improvements in code generation. Despite these advancements, the security of CoT models has not been systematically studied. In this study, we aim to fill this gap by investigating the vulnerability of CoT models to backdoor injection in code generation tasks. To address this, we propose a model-agnostic backdoor attack method SABER (Self-Attention-BasEd backdooR) based on the self-attention mechanism. SABER begins by selecting a malicious output as the backdoor using code mutation operations. It then identifies the tokens most relevant to poisoned content by analyzing self-attention scores in the CodeBERT model. Finally, it mimicks user behavior to generate adaptive and natural triggers. Our experiments on HumanEval-CoT and OpenEval-CoT test sets demonstrate that CoT models are susceptible to backdoor attacks via data poisoning. Taking the HumanEval-CoT dataset as an example, SABER achieves an ASR of 80.95%, representing an improvement of 33.33% over RIPPLe and a substantial 4.76% enhancement compared to BadPre. Further evaluations using ONION for automated detection and human studies reveal that SABER is stealthier and harder to detect, bypassing 61.90% of automated detection, with a human detection rate of just 3.17%. Our findings reveal that backdoors can be injected into CoT models to manipulate downstream code generation tasks. This highlights the urgent need for further research to understand and mitigate the security vulnerabilities in CoT models.</p></details> | UNDER REVIEW |

However, current benchmarks lack a dedicated evaluation framework for this capability. To fill this gap, we introduce FEA-Bench, a benchmark designed to assess the ability of large language models (LLMs) to perform incremental development within code repositories. We collect pull requests from 83 GitHub repositories and use rule-based and intent-based filtering to construct task instances focused on new feature development. Each task instance containing code changes is paired with relevant unit test files to ensure that the solution can be verified. The feature implementation requires LLMs to simultaneously possess code completion capabilities for new components and code editing abilities for other relevant parts in the code repository, providing a more comprehensive evaluation method of LLMs' automated software engineering capabilities. Experimental results show that LLMs perform significantly worse in the FEA-Bench, highlighting considerable challenges in such repository-level incremental code development.</p></details> |  |

Dynamic Benchmarking for Code Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06643v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we tackle a critical challenge in model evaluation: how to keep code benchmarks useful when models might have already seen them during training. We introduce a novel solution, dynamic benchmarking framework, to address this challenge. Given a code understanding or reasoning benchmark, our framework dynamically transforms each input, i.e., programs, with various semantic-preserving mutations to build a syntactically new while semantically identical benchmark. We evaluated ten popular language models on our dynamic benchmarks. Our evaluation reveals several interesting or surprising findings: (1) all models perform significantly worse than before, (2) the ranking between some models shifts dramatically, and (3) our dynamic benchmarks can resist against the data contamination problem.</p></details> | 14 pages, 7 figures |

Therefore, determining whether a piece of code is written by a human or generated by an artificial intelligence (AI) model is a critical issue. In this study, we present AIGCodeSet, which consists of 2.828 AI-generated and 4.755 human-written Python codes, created using CodeLlama 34B, Codestral 22B, and Gemini 1.5 Flash. In addition, we share the results of our experiments conducted with baseline detection methods. Our experiments show that a Bayesian classifier outperforms the other models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Phase Coded Image Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03906v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Phase-coded imaging is a computational imaging method designed to tackle tasks such as passive depth estimation and extended depth of field (EDOF) using depth cues inserted during image capture. Most of the current deep learning-based methods for depth estimation or all-in-focus imaging require a training dataset with high-quality depth maps and an optimal focus point at infinity for all-in-focus images. Such datasets are difficult to create, usually synthetic, and require external graphic programs. We propose a new method named "Deep Phase Coded Image Prior" (DPCIP) for jointly recovering the depth map and all-in-focus image from a coded-phase image using solely the captured image and the optical information of the imaging system. Our approach does not depend on any specific dataset and surpasses prior supervised techniques utilizing the same imaging system. This improvement is achieved through the utilization of a problem formulation based on implicit neural representation (INR) and deep image prior (DIP). Due to our zero-shot method, we overcome the barrier of acquiring accurate ground-truth data of depth maps and all-in-focus images for each new phase-coded system introduced. This allows focusing mainly on developing the imaging system, and not on ground-truth data collection.</p></details> |  |
| **[PerfRL: A Small Language Model Framework for Efficient Code Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.05657v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code optimization is a challenging task requiring a substantial level of expertise from developers. Nonetheless, this level of human capacity is not sufficient considering the rapid evolution of new hardware architectures and software environments. In light of this, recent research proposes adopting machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to automate the code optimization process. In this paper, we introduce PerfRL, an innovative framework designed to tackle the problem of code optimization. Our framework leverages the capabilities of small language models (SLMs) and reinforcement learning (RL), facilitating a system where SLMs can assimilate feedback from their environment during the fine-tuning phase, notably through unit tests. When benchmarked against existing models, PerfRL demonstrates superior efficiency in terms of speed and computational resource usage, attributed to its reduced need for training steps and its compatibility with SLMs. Furthermore, it substantially diminishes the risk of logical and syntactical errors. To evaluate our framework, we conduct experiments on the PIE dataset using a lightweight large language model (i.e., CodeT5) and a new reinforcement learning algorithm, namely RRHF. For evaluation purposes, we use a list of evaluation metrics related to optimization quality and speedup. The evaluation results show that our approach achieves similar or better results compared to state-of-the-art models using shorter training times and smaller pre-trained models.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeBrain: Imputing Any Brain MRI via Modality- and Instance-Specific Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18328v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified MRI imputation, which can adapt to diverse imputation scenarios, is highly desirable as it reduces scanning costs and provides comprehensive MRI information for improved clinical diagnosis. Existing unified MRI imputation methods either rely on specific prompts to guide their transformation network or require multiple modality-specific modules. However, these approaches struggle to capture large modality and instance variations or become too complex to generalize effectively. To address these limitations, we propose CodeBrain, a fundamentally different pipeline for unified brain MRI imputation. Our key idea is to reframe various inter-modality transformations as a full-modality code prediction task via a two-stage framework. In the first stage, CodeBrain reconstructs a target modality from any other modalities by learning a compact scalar-quantized code for each instance and modality. Any target modality can then be reconstructed with high fidelity by combining the corresponding code with shared features extracted from any available modality. In the second stage, a projection encoder is trained to predict full-modality compact codes from any incomplete MRI samples, effectively simulating various imputation scenarios. We evaluate our CodeBrain on two public brain MRI datasets (i.e., IXI and BraTS 2023). Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeBrain outperforms state-of-the-art methods, setting a new benchmark for unified brain MRI imputation. Our code will be released.</p></details> | CodeBrain v2 |

Verhoeff provided the first examples of a decimal error detecting code using a single check digit to provide protection against all single, transposition and adjacent twin errors. The three codes he presented are length 3-digit codes with 2 information digits. Existence of a 4-digit code would imply the existence of 10 such disjoint 3-digit codes. Apparently, not even a pair of such disjoint 3-digit codes is known. The code developed herein, has the property that the knowledge of any two digits is sufficient to determine the entire codeword even though their positions were unknown. This fulfills Verhoeff's desire to eliminate "cyclic errors". Phonetic errors, where 2 digit pairs of the forms X0 and 1X are interchanged, are also eliminated.</p></details> |  |

Although prior research has assessed LLM-generated code and identified various quality issues -- such as redundancy, poor maintainability, and sub-optimal performance a systematic understanding and categorization of these inefficiencies remain unexplored. Without such knowledge, practitioners struggle to optimize LLM-generated code for real-world applications, limiting its adoption. This study can also guide improving code LLMs, enhancing the quality and efficiency of code generation. Therefore, in this study, we empirically investigate inefficiencies in LLM-generated code by state-of-the-art models, i.e., CodeLlama, DeepSeek-Coder, and CodeGemma. To do so, we analyze 492 generated code snippets in the HumanEval++ dataset. We then construct a taxonomy of inefficiencies in LLM-generated code that includes 5 categories General Logic, Performance, Readability, Maintainability, and Errors) and 19 subcategories of inefficiencies. We then validate the proposed taxonomy through an online survey with 58 LLM practitioners and researchers. Our study indicates that logic and performance-related inefficiencies are the most popular, relevant, and frequently co-occur and impact overall code quality inefficiency. Our taxonomy provides a structured basis for evaluating the quality LLM-generated code and guiding future research to improve code generation efficiency.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel approach named LMST that enables conversion of the inferencing path of an ML model as well as its weights trained off-chain into Solidity code using Large Language Models (LLMs). Extensive prompt engineering is done to achieve gas cost optimization beyond mere correctness of the produced code, while taking into consideration the capabilities and limitations of the Ethereum Virtual Machine. We have also developed a proof of concept decentralized application using the code so generated for verifying the accuracy claims of the underlying ML model. An extensive set of experiments demonstrate the feasibility of deploying ML models on blockchains through automated code translation using LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, a notable research gap exists in evaluating social biases that may be present in the code produced by LLMs. To solve this issue, we propose a novel fairness framework, i.e., Solar, to assess and mitigate the social biases of LLM-generated code. Specifically, Solar can automatically generate test cases for quantitatively uncovering social biases of the auto-generated code by LLMs. To quantify the severity of social biases in generated code, we develop a dataset that covers a diverse set of social problems. We applied Solar and the crafted dataset to four state-of-the-art LLMs for code generation. Our evaluation reveals severe bias in the LLM-generated code from all the subject LLMs. Furthermore, we explore several prompting strategies for mitigating bias, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, combining positive role-playing with CoT prompting and dialogue with Solar. Our experiments show that dialogue with Solar can effectively reduce social bias in LLM-generated code by up to 90%. Last, we make the code and data publicly available is highly extensible to evaluate new social problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication in the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Grammar-Based Code Representation: Is It a Worthy Pursuit for LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05507v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grammar serves as a cornerstone in programming languages and software engineering, providing frameworks to define the syntactic space and program structure. Existing research demonstrates the effectiveness of grammar-based code representations in small-scale models, showing their ability to reduce syntax errors and enhance performance. However, as language models scale to the billion level or beyond, syntax-level errors become rare, making it unclear whether grammar information still provides performance benefits. To explore this, we develop a series of billion-scale GrammarCoder models, incorporating grammar rules in the code generation process. Experiments on HumanEval (+) and MBPP (+) demonstrate a notable improvement in code generation accuracy. Further analysis shows that grammar-based representations enhance LLMs' ability to discern subtle code differences, reducing semantic errors caused by minor variations. These findings suggest that grammar-based code representations remain valuable even in billion-scale models, not only by maintaining syntax correctness but also by improving semantic differentiation.</p></details> |  |

To enable this collaboration, OSS projects are hosted on social-coding platforms like GitHub, which provide the infrastructure to host the code as well as the support for enabling the participation of the community. The potentially rich and diverse mixture of contributors in OSS projects makes their management not only a technical challenge, where automation tools and bots are usually deployed, but also a social one. To this aim, OSS projects have been increasingly deploying a declaration of their code of conduct, which defines rules to ensure a respectful and inclusive participatory environment in the community, being the Contributor Covenant the main model to follow. However, the broad adoption and enforcement of codes of conduct in OSS projects is still limited. In particular, the definition, deployment, and enforcement of codes of conduct is a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose an approach to effectively manage codes of conduct in OSS projects based on the Contributor Covenant proposal. Our solution has been implemented as a bot-based solution where bots help in the definition of codes of conduct, the monitoring of OSS projects, and the enforcement of ethical rules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 IEEE/ACM 47th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Society (ICSE-SEIS)</p></details> |

The InI index provides a comprehensive assessment focusing on three key components: efficiency, consistency, and accuracy. This approach encapsulates time-based efficiency, response quality, and the stability of model outputs, offering a thorough understanding of LLM performance beyond traditional accuracy metrics. We applied this methodology to compare OpenAI's GPT-4o (GPT), OpenAI-o1 pro (OAI1), and OpenAI-o3 mini-high (OAI3) in generating Python code for the Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM) model to forecast meteorological variables such as temperature, relative humidity and wind velocity. Our findings demonstrate that GPT outperforms OAI1 and performs comparably to OAI3 regarding accuracy and workflow efficiency. The study reveals that LLM-assisted code generation can produce results similar to expert-designed models with effective prompting and refinement. GPT's performance advantage highlights the benefits of widespread use and user feedback.</p></details> | 20 pages, 6 figures |

Open-source models such as CodeBERT and UniXcoder exhibit limitations in scalability and efficiency, while high-performing proprietary systems impose substantial computational costs. We introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to construct task-specific adapters for code retrieval. Our approach reduces the number of trainable parameters to less than two percent of the base model, enabling rapid fine-tuning on extensive code corpora (2 million samples in 25 minutes on two H100 GPUs). Experiments demonstrate an increase of up to 9.1% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) for Code2Code search, and up to 86.69% for Text2Code search tasks across multiple programming languages. Distinction in task-wise and language-wise adaptation helps explore the sensitivity of code retrieval for syntactical and linguistic variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Deep Learning for Code (DL4C) Workshop at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Clinical coders and physicians assign codes to patient episodes based on their interpretation of case notes or electronic patient records. Therefore, accurate coding relies on the legibility of case notes and the coders' understanding of medical terminology. During the last ten years, many studies have shown poor reproducibility of clinical coding, even recently, with the application of Artificial Intelligence-based models. Given this context, the paper aims to present the SISCO.web approach designed to support physicians in filling in Hospital Discharge Records with proper diagnoses and procedures codes using the International Classification of Diseases (9th and 10th), and, above all, in identifying the main pathological condition. The web service leverages NLP algorithms, specific coding rules, as well as ad hoc decision trees to identify the main condition, showing promising results in providing accurate ICD coding suggestions.</p></details> | 18 pages |

Exploring the Algorithmic Diversity of Model-Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00691v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models (LMs) have exhibited impressive abilities in generating code from natural language requirements. In this work, we highlight the diversity of code generated by LMs as a critical criterion for evaluating their code generation capabilities. There is a lack of studies focused on assessing the diversity of generated code, which overlooks its importance in code LMs. Therefore, we propose a systematic approach to evaluate code diversity, introducing various metrics with inter-code similarity. Specifically, we introduce code clustering methods that leverages LMs' capabilities in code understanding and reasoning, resulting in a set of metrics that represent the number of algorithms in model-generated solutions. We extensively investigate the property of model-generated solutions by contrasting them with human-written ones and quantifying the impact of various factors on code diversity: model size, temperature, instruction tuning, and problem complexity. Our analysis demonstrates that model-generated solutions exhibit low algorithmic diversity, which was neglected by the research community. Moreover, we explore methods to increase code diversity by combining solutions from different models and increasing sampling temperatures. Our findings highlight that code diversity can be enhanced with the help of heterogeneous models and setting temperature beyond 1.0 that has not been fully explored due to the functional correctness degradation. To facilitate our research direction, we publicly share our code and datasets through open-source repositories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quasi-linear time decoding of RS and AG codes for burst errors up to the Singleton bound](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05062v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite of tremendous research on decoding Reed-Solomon (RS) and algebraic geometry (AG) codes under the random and adversary substitution error models, few studies have explored these codes under the burst substitution error model. Burst errors are prevalent in many communication channels, such as wireless networks, magnetic recording systems, and flash memory. Compared to random and adversarial errors, burst errors often allow for the design of more efficient decoding algorithms. However, achieving both an optimal decoding radius and quasi-linear time complexity for burst error correction remains a significant challenge. The goal of this paper is to design (both list and probabilistic unique) decoding algorithms for RS and AG codes that achieve the Singleton bound for decoding radius while maintaining quasi-linear time complexity. Our idea is to build a one-to-one correspondence between AG codes (including RS codes) and interleaved RS codes with shorter code lengths (or even constant lengths). By decoding the interleaved RS codes with burst errors, we derive efficient decoding algorithms for RS and AG codes. For decoding interleaved RS codes with shorter code lengths, we can employ either the naive methods or existing algorithms. This one-to-one correspondence is constructed using the generalized fast Fourier transform (G-FFT) proposed by Li and Xing (SODA 2024). The G-FFT generalizes the divide-and-conquer technique from polynomials to algebraic function fields. More precisely speaking, assume that our AG code is defined over a function field $E$ which has a sequence of subfields $\mathbb{F}_q(x)=E_r\subseteq E_{r-1}\subseteq \cdots\subset E_1\subseteq E_0=E$ such that $E_{i-1}/E_i$ are Galois extensions for $1\le i\le r$. Then the AG code based on $E$ can be transformed into an interleaved RS code over the rational function field $\mathbb{F}_q(x)$.</p></details> |  |

However, the cybersecurity vulnerabilities and implications arising from the widespread integration of these models are not yet fully understood due to limited research in this domain. This work investigates novel techniques for transitioning backdoors from the AI/ML domain to traditional computer malware, shedding light on the critical intersection of AI and cyber/software security. To explore this intersection, we present MalInstructCoder, a framework designed to comprehensively assess the cybersecurity vulnerabilities of instruction-tuned Code LLMs. MalInstructCoder introduces an automated data poisoning pipeline to inject malicious code snippets into benign code, poisoning instruction fine-tuning data while maintaining functional validity. It presents two practical adversarial instruction tuning attacks with real-world security implications: the clean prompt poisoning attack and the backdoor attack. These attacks aim to manipulate Code LLMs to generate code incorporating malicious or harmful functionality under specific attack scenarios while preserving intended functionality. We conduct a comprehensive investigation into the exploitability of the code-specific instruction tuning process involving three state-of-the-art Code LLMs: CodeLlama, DeepSeek-Coder, and StarCoder2. Our findings reveal that these models are highly vulnerable to our attacks. Specifically, the clean prompt poisoning attack achieves the ASR@1 ranging from over 75% to 86% by poisoning only 1% (162 samples) of the instruction fine-tuning dataset. Similarly, the backdoor attack achieves the ASR@1 ranging from 76% to 86% with a 0.5% poisoning rate. Our study sheds light on the critical cybersecurity risks posed by instruction-tuned Code LLMs and highlights the urgent need for robust defense mechanisms.</p></details> |  |

This paradigm leverages ubiquitous edge devices for environmental sensing and deploys AI algorithms at edge servers to interpret the observations via remote inference on wirelessly uploaded features. A significant challenge arises in designing EI-Sense systems for 6G mission-critical applications, which demand high performance under stringent latency constraints. To tackle this challenge, we focus on the end-to-end (E2E) performance of EI-Sense and characterize a source-channel tradeoff that balances source distortion and channel reliability. In this work, we establish a theoretical foundation for the source-channel tradeoff by quantifying the effects of source coding on feature discriminant gains and channel reliability on packet loss. Building on this foundation, we design the coding rate control by optimizing the tradeoff to minimize the E2E sensing error probability, leading to a low-complexity algorithm for ultra-low-latency EI-Sense. Finally, we validate our theoretical analysis and proposed coding rate control algorithm through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating the sensing performance gain of our approach with respect to traditional reliability-centric methods.</p></details> |  |

We begin with the specific case of polycyclic codes associated with a trinomial $x^n - a_{\ell} x^{\ell} - a_0$ (for some $0< \ell <n$), which we refer to as \textit{$\ell$-trinomial codes}, after which we generalize our results to general polycyclic codes. We introduce an equivalence relation called \textit{$n$-equivalence}, which extends the known notion of $n$-equivalence for constacyclic codes \cite{Chen2014}. We compute the number of $n$-equivalence classes %, $ N_{(n,\ell)}$, for this relation and provide conditions under which two families of polycyclic (or $\ell$-trinomial) codes are equivalent. In particular, we prove that when $\gcd(n, n-\ell) = 1$, any $\ell$-trinomial code family is equivalent to a trinomial code family associated with the polynomial $x^n - x^{\ell} - 1$. Finally, we focus on $p^{\ell}$-trinomial codes of length $p^{\ell+r}$, where $p$ is the characteristic of $\mathbb{F}_q$ and $r$ an integer, and provide some examples as an application of the theory developed in this paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exit the Code: A Model for Understanding Career Abandonment Intention Among Software Developers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04460v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background. Career abandonment, the process in which professionals leave the activity, assuming positions in another area, among software developers involves frustration with the lost investment and emotional and financial costs, even though being beneficial for the human being, depending on personal context. Previous studies have identified work-related motivators for career abandonment, such as the threat of obsolescence, unstable requirements, and low code quality, though these factors have primarily been examined in former developers. The relationship between these motivators and the intention to abandon among currently active developers remains unexplored. Goal. This article investigates the relationship between key work-related motivators and currently active software developers intention to abandon their careers. Method. We employed a quantitative approach, surveying 221 software developers to validate a theoretical model for career abandonment intention, based on an adaptation of the Investment Model, which incorporates satisfaction with technical aspects of the profession as well as the intention to abandon. Findings. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, through structural equation modeling (SEM), provided robust support for the adapted Investment Model in explaining software developers intention to abandon their careers. Moreover, career commitment significantly impacts the intention to leave the profession, being positively influenced by satisfaction with technical work-related factors and negatively influenced by career alternatives and career investment. Conclusion. The paper offers valuable insights for organizational leaders and research, potentially guiding retention strategies to better support developers, and the adoption of theoretical models to explain career abandonment.</p></details> |  |

Following the success of model-based reinforcement learning algorithms and the rapid adoption of the Transformer architecture for its superior training efficiency and favorable scaling properties, recent works such as STORM have proposed replacing RNN-based world models with Transformer-based world models using masked self-attention. However, despite the improved training efficiency of these methods, their impact on performance remains limited compared to the Dreamer algorithm, struggling to learn competitive Transformer-based world models. In this work, we show that the next state prediction objective adopted in previous approaches is insufficient to fully exploit the representation capabilities of Transformers. We propose to extend world model predictions to longer time horizons by introducing TWISTER (Transformer-based World model wIth contraSTivE Representations), a world model using action-conditioned Contrastive Predictive Coding to learn high-level temporal feature representations and improve the agent performance. TWISTER achieves a human-normalized mean score of 162% on the Atari 100k benchmark, setting a new record among state-of-the-art methods that do not employ look-ahead search.</p></details> |  |

However, progress in this critical domain remains hampered by a fundamental limitation: the absence of a rigorous evaluation framework for long code understanding. To gap this obstacle, we propose a long code understanding benchmark LONGCODEU from four aspects (8 tasks) to evaluate LCLMs' long code understanding ability required for practical applications, including code unit perception, intra-code unit understanding, inter-code unit relation understanding, and long code documentation understanding. We evaluate 9 popular LCLMs on LONGCODEU (i.e., 6 general models and 3 code models). Our experimental results reveal key limitations in current LCLMs' capabilities for long code understanding. Particularly, the performance of LCLMs drops dramatically when the long code length is greater than 32K, falling far short of their claimed 128K-1M context windows. In the four aspects, inter-code unit relation understanding is the most challenging for LCLMs. Our study provides valuable insights for optimizing LCLMs and driving advancements in software engineering.</p></details> | 18 pages |

However, the high-dimensional sparsity, batch effect noise, category imbalance, and ever-increasing data scale of the original sequencing data pose significant challenges for multi-center knowledge transfer, data fusion, and cross-validation between scRNA-seq datasets. To address these barriers, (1) we first propose a latent codes-based scRNA-seq dataset distillation framework named scDD, which transfers and distills foundation model knowledge and original dataset information into a compact latent space and generates synthetic scRNA-seq dataset by a generator to replace the original dataset. Then, (2) we propose a single-step conditional diffusion generator named SCDG, which perform single-step gradient back-propagation to help scDD optimize distillation quality and avoid gradient decay caused by multi-step back-propagation. Meanwhile, SCDG ensures the scRNA-seq data characteristics and inter-class discriminability of the synthetic dataset through flexible conditional control and generation quality assurance. Finally, we propose a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of scRNA-seq dataset distillation in different data analysis tasks. It is validated that our proposed method can achieve 7.61% absolute and 15.70% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods on average task.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, the paper deals with the problem of analytical saturation of initial codes, as produced by LLMs. Thematic Analysis is a well-established qualitative analysis method composed of interlinked phases. A key phase is the initial coding, where the analysts assign labels to discrete components of a dataset. Saturation is a way to measure the validity of a qualitative analysis and relates to the recurrence and repetition of initial codes. In the paper we reflect on how well LLMs achieve analytical saturation and propose also a novel technique to measure Inductive Thematic Saturation (ITS). This novel technique leverages a programming framework called DSPy. The proposed novel approach allows a precise measurement of ITS.</p></details> |  |

Current solutions face three challenges: 1) Cloud-based LLMs pose data security risks; 2) Local model deployment demands technical expertise; 3) General LLMs lack mechanisms to integrate medical knowledge. Retrieval-augmented systems also struggle with medical document processing and clinical usability. We developed KidneyTalk-open, a desktop system integrating three technical components: 1) No-code deployment of state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source LLMs (such as DeepSeek-r1, Qwen2.5) via local inference engine; 2) Medical document processing pipeline combining context-aware chunking and intelligent filtering; 3) Adaptive Retrieval and Augmentation Pipeline (AddRep) employing agents collaboration for improving the recall rate of medical documents. A graphical interface was designed to enable clinicians to manage medical documents and conduct AI-powered consultations without technical expertise. Experimental validation on 1,455 challenging nephrology exam questions demonstrates AddRep's effectiveness: achieving 29.1% accuracy (+8.1% over baseline) with intelligent knowledge integration, while maintaining robustness through 4.9% rejection rate to suppress hallucinations. Comparative case studies with the mainstream products (AnythingLLM, Chatbox, GPT4ALL) demonstrate KidneyTalk-open's superior performance in real clinical query. KidneyTalk-open represents the first no-code medical LLM system enabling secure documentation-enhanced medical Q&A on desktop. Its designs establishes a new framework for privacy-sensitive clinical AI applications. The system significantly lowers technical barriers while improving evidence traceability, enabling more medical staff or patients to use SOTA open-source LLMs conveniently.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corresponding authors: zhanglx@bjmu.edu.cn; joy_yuxi@pku.edu.cn; hongshenda@pku.edu.cn</p></details> |

However, the current benchmarking approach heavily depends on publicly available, human-created datasets. The widespread use of these fixed benchmark datasets makes the benchmarking process to be static and thus particularly susceptible to data contamination, an unavoidable consequence of the extensive data collection processes used to train Code LLMs. Existing approaches that address data contamination often suffer from human effort limitations and imbalanced problem complexity. To tackle these challenges, we propose \tool, a novel benchmarking suite for evaluating Code LLMs under potential data contamination. Given a seed programming problem, \tool employs multiple agents to extract and modify the context without altering the core logic, generating semantically equivalent variations. We introduce a dynamic data generation methods and conduct empirical studies on two seed datasets across 21 Code LLMs. Results show that \tool effectively benchmarks reasoning capabilities under contamination risks while generating diverse problem sets to ensure consistent and reliable evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://codekaleidoscope.github.io/dycodeeval.html</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Memorization: Evaluating the True Type Inference Capabilities of LLMs for Java Code Snippets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04076v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Type inference is a crucial task for reusing online code snippets, often found on platforms like StackOverflow, which frequently lack essential type information such as fully qualified names (FQNs) and required libraries. Recent studies have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for type inference on code snippets, showing promising results. However, these results are potentially affected by data leakage, as the benchmark suite (StatType-SO) has been public on GitHub since 2017 (full suite in 2023). Thus, it is uncertain whether LLMs' strong performance reflects genuine code semantics understanding or a mere retrieval of ground truth from training data. To comprehensively assess LLMs' type inference capabilities on Java code snippets, we conducted a three-pronged evaluation. First, utilizing Thalia, a program synthesis technique, we created ThaliaType--a new, unseen dataset for type inference evaluation. On unseen snippets, LLM performance dropped significantly, with up to a 59% decrease in precision and 72% in recall. Second, we developed semantic-preserving transformations that significantly degraded LLMs' type inference performance, revealing weaknesses in understanding code semantics. Third, we used delta debugging to identify the minimal syntax elements sufficient for LLM inference. While type inference primarily involves inferring FQNs for types in the code snippet, LLMs correctly infer FQNs even when the types were absent from the snippets, suggesting a reliance on knowledge from training instead of thoroughly analyzing the snippets. Our findings indicate that LLMs' strong past performance likely stemmed from data leakage, rather than a genuine understanding of the semantics of code snippets. Our findings highlight the crucial need for carefully designed benchmarks using unseen code snippets to assess the true capabilities of LLMs for type inference tasks.</p></details> | under review |

To efficiently model this phenomenon, aperture or slot models are often used in conjunction with surface integral equations to solve Maxwell's equations. To establish the credibility of these models, code verification is necessary to assess the correctness of the implementation of the underlying numerical methods. However, many characteristics of surface integral equations and slot models render traditional code-verification approaches ineffective. In this paper, we present approaches to separately measure the different sources of numerical error arising from the method-of-moments implementation of the electric-field integral equation with an arbitrary-depth slot model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches for several cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2406.14573</p></details> |

Developers increasingly use them for their work, including generating code to fulfil the data protection requirements (privacy) of the apps they build. We wanted to know if the reality is the same as expectations of AI-based programming assistants when trying to fulfil software privacy requirements, and the challenges developers face when using AI-based programming assistants and how these can be improved. To this end, we conducted a survey with 51 developers worldwide. We found that AI-based programming assistants need to be improved in order for developers to better trust them with generating code that ensures privacy. In this paper, we provide some practical recommendations for developers to consider following when using AI-based programming assistants for privacy-related code development, and some key further research directions.</p></details> |  |

Although decompilation techniques attempt to recover higher-level source code from the machine code in question, they are not fully able to restore the semantics of the original functions. Furthermore, binaries are often stripped of metadata, and this makes it challenging to reverse engineer complex binary software. In this paper we show how a combination of binary decomposition techniques, decompilation passes, and LLM-powered function summarization can be used to build an economical engine to identify modules in stripped binaries and associate them with high-level natural language descriptions. We instantiated this technique with three underlying open-source LLMs -- CodeQwen, DeepSeek-Coder and CodeStral -- and measured its effectiveness in identifying modules in robotics firmware. This experimental evaluation involved 467 modules from four devices from the ArduPilot software suite, and showed that CodeStral, the best-performing backend LLM, achieves an average F1-score of 0.68 with an online running time of just a handful of seconds.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |

In this work, we introduce quantum Margulis codes, a new class of QLDPC codes derived from Margulis' classical LDPC construction via the two-block group algebra framework. We show that quantum Margulis codes, unlike bivariate bicycle codes which require ordered statistics decoding for effective error correction, can be efficiently decoded using a standard min-sum decoder with linear complexity, when decoded under depolarizing noise. This is attributed to their Tanner graph structure, which does not exhibit group symmetry, thereby mitigating the well-known problem of error degeneracy in QLDPC decoding. To further enhance performance, we propose an algorithm for constructing 2BGA codes with controlled girth, ensuring a minimum girth of 6 or 8, and use it to generate several quantum Margulis codes of length 240 and 642. We validate our approach through numerical simulations, demonstrating that quantum Margulis codes behave significantly better than BB codes in the error floor region, under min-sum decoding.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures.

To this end, we adapt two state-of-the-art techniques from natural language generation -- one based on entropy and another on mutual information -- to the domain of code generation. Given the distinct semantic properties of code, we introduce modifications, including a semantic equivalence check based on symbolic execution. Our findings indicate a strong correlation between the uncertainty computed through these techniques and correctness, highlighting the potential of uncertainty estimation for quality assessment. Additionally, we propose a simplified version of the entropy-based method that assumes a uniform distribution over the LLM's responses, demonstrating comparable effectiveness. Using these techniques, we develop an abstention policy that prevents the model from making predictions when uncertainty is high, reducing incorrect outputs to near zero. Our evaluation on the LiveCodeBench shows that our approach significantly outperforms a baseline relying solely on LLM-reported log-probabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages and 3 References Pages</p></details> |

Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) recently emerged as a solution for adaptive embedding lengths, but it requires full model retraining and suffers from noticeable performance degradations at short lengths. In this paper, we show that sparse coding offers a compelling alternative for achieving adaptive representation with minimal overhead and higher fidelity. We propose Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR), a method that sparsifies pre-trained embeddings into a high-dimensional but selectively activated feature space. By leveraging lightweight autoencoding and task-aware contrastive objectives, CSR preserves semantic quality while allowing flexible, cost-effective inference at different sparsity levels. Extensive experiments on image, text, and multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that CSR consistently outperforms MRL in terms of both accuracy and retrieval speed-often by large margins-while also cutting training time to a fraction of that required by MRL. Our results establish sparse coding as a powerful paradigm for adaptive representation learning in real-world applications where efficiency and fidelity are both paramount.

However, contemporary code language models (LMs) lack the ability to handle diverse types of code-edit requirements. In this work, we attempt to overcome this shortcoming through (1) a novel synthetic data generation pipeline and (2) a robust model adaptation algorithm. Starting with seed code examples and diverse editing criteria, our pipeline generates high-quality samples comprising original and modified code, along with natural language instructions in different styles and verbosity. Today's code LMs come bundled with strong abilities, such as code generation and instruction following, which should not be lost due to fine-tuning. To ensure this, we propose a novel adaptation algorithm, SeleKT, that (a) leverages a dense gradient-based step to identify the weights that are most important for code editing, and (b) does a sparse projection onto the base model to avoid overfitting. Using our approach, we obtain a new series of models NextCoder (adapted from QwenCoder-2.5) that achieves strong results on five code-editing benchmarks, outperforming comparable size models and even several larger ones. We show the generality of our approach on two model families (DeepSeekCoder and QwenCoder), compare against other fine-tuning approaches, and demonstrate robustness by showing retention of code generation abilities post adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Code Language Models for Automated HLS-based Hardware Generation: Benchmark, Infrastructure and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13921v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in code generation have illuminated the potential of employing large language models (LLMs) for general-purpose programming languages such as Python and C++, opening new opportunities for automating software development and enhancing programmer productivity. The potential of LLMs in software programming has sparked significant interest in exploring automated hardware generation and automation. Although preliminary endeavors have been made to adopt LLMs in generating hardware description languages (HDLs), several challenges persist in this direction. First, the volume of available HDL training data is substantially smaller compared to that for software programming languages. Second, the pre-trained LLMs, mainly tailored for software code, tend to produce HDL designs that are more error-prone. Third, the generation of HDL requires a significantly higher number of tokens compared to software programming, leading to inefficiencies in cost and energy consumption. To tackle these challenges, this paper explores leveraging LLMs to generate High-Level Synthesis (HLS)-based hardware design. Although code generation for domain-specific programming languages is not new in the literature, we aim to provide experimental results, insights, benchmarks, and evaluation infrastructure to investigate the suitability of HLS over low-level HDLs for LLM-assisted hardware design generation. To achieve this, we first finetune pre-trained models for HLS-based hardware generation, using a collected dataset with text prompts and corresponding reference HLS designs. An LLM-assisted framework is then proposed to automate end-to-end hardware code generation, which also investigates the impact of chain-of-thought and feedback loops promoting techniques on HLS-design generation. Limited by the timeframe of this research, we plan to evaluate more advanced reasoning models in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted by ASP-DAC'25</p></details> |

However, real-world detection requires interprocedural analysis, as vulnerabilities often emerge through multi-hop function calls rather than isolated functions. While repository-level benchmarks like ReposVul and VulEval introduce interprocedural context, they remain computationally expensive, lack pairwise evaluation of vulnerability fixes, and explore limited context retrieval, limiting their practicality. We introduce JitVul, a JIT vulnerability detection benchmark linking each function to its vulnerability-introducing and fixing commits. Built from 879 CVEs spanning 91 vulnerability types, JitVul enables comprehensive evaluation of detection capabilities. Our results show that ReAct Agents, leveraging thought-action-observation and interprocedural context, perform better than LLMs in distinguishing vulnerable from benign code. While prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought help LLMs, ReAct Agents require further refinement. Both methods show inconsistencies, either misidentifying vulnerabilities or over-analyzing security guards, indicating significant room for improvement.</p></details> |  |

Furthermore, we construct $ q $-ary linear codes from the incidence matrix of $ G(\mathbb{Z}_n) $, explicitly determining their parameters and duals. A primary contribution of this work is the resolution of two conjectures from \cite{Jain2023} concerning the structural and coding-theoretic properties of $ G(\mathbb{Z}_n) $.

Code generation not only facilitates faster prototyping and automated testing, but also augments developer efficiency through improved maintainability and reusability of code. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess the abilities of LLMs to adhere to task-oriented instructions within diverse code generation scenarios. CodeIF encompasses a broad range of tasks, including function synthesis, error debugging, algorithmic refactoring, and code explanation, thereby providing a comprehensive suite to evaluate model performance across varying complexity levels and programming domains. We conduct extensive experiments with LLMs, analyzing their strengths and limitations in meeting the demands of these tasks. The experimental results offer valuable insights into how well current models align with human instructions, as well as the extent to which they can generate consistent, maintainable, and contextually relevant code. Our findings not only underscore the critical role that instruction-following LLMs can play in modern software development, but also illuminate pathways for future research aimed at enhancing their adaptability, reliability, and overall effectiveness in automated code generation.</p></details> |  |

The analysis is comprehensive for that we consider M-to-N broadcast instead of 1-to-N, which allows both different messages and same messages to be transmitted by several sources at the same time. Although the routes between source-destination pairs are subject to change when some nodes have large backlogs, we derive fixed equivalent routes to provide a upper bound of delay. For some special cases, an detour method is also provided to increase the estimation accuracy. Different network topologies are tested in numeric simulation. The results demonstrate the accuracy of our delay performance approximation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods for code embedding, including those based on LLMs, often depend on costly supervised training or fine-tuning for domain adaptation. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot approach, zsLLMCode, to generate code embeddings by using LLMs and sentence embedding models. This approach attempts to eliminate the need for task-specific training or fine-tuning, and to effectively address the issue of erroneous information commonly found in LLM-generated outputs. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach by considering various LLMs and embedding models. The results have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of our method zsLLMCode over state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches such as SourcererCC, Code2vec, InferCode, and TransformCode. Our findings highlight the potential of zsLLMCode to advance the field of SE by providing robust and efficient solutions for code embedding tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Error Correction Code Transformer: From Non-Unified to Unified](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03364v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Channel coding is vital for reliable data transmission in modern wireless systems, and its significance will increase with the emergence of sixth-generation (6G) networks, which will need to support various error correction codes. However, traditional decoders were typically designed as fixed hardware circuits tailored to specific decoding algorithms, leading to inefficiencies and limited flexibility. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a unified, code-agnostic Transformer-based decoding architecture capable of handling multiple linear block codes, including Polar, Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC), and Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH), within a single framework. To achieve this, standardized units are employed to harmonize parameters across different code types, while the redesigned unified attention module compresses the structural information of various codewords. Additionally, a sparse mask, derived from the sparsity of the parity-check matrix, is introduced to enhance the model's ability to capture inherent constraints between information and parity-check bits, resulting in improved decoding accuracy and robustness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed unified Transformer-based decoder not only outperforms existing methods but also provides a flexible, efficient, and high-performance solution for next-generation wireless communication systems.</p></details> |  |

This provides a uniform framework for studying generalized weights of linear block codes, linear codes over a ring, rank-metric and sum-rank metric codes. Under suitable assumptions, we show that the latroid determines the weight distribution of the code.</p></details> |  |

Existing code-focused resources typically fail to ensure either the breadth of coverage (e.g., spanning simple coding tasks to advanced algorithmic problems) or verifiable correctness (e.g., unit tests). In contrast, KodCode comprises question-solution-test triplets that are systematically validated via a self-verification procedure. Our pipeline begins by synthesizing a broad range of coding questions, then generates solutions and test cases with additional attempts allocated to challenging problems. Finally, post-training data synthesis is done by rewriting questions into diverse formats and generating responses under a test-based reject sampling procedure from a reasoning model (DeepSeek R1). This pipeline yields a large-scale, robust and diverse coding dataset. KodCode is suitable for supervised fine-tuning and the paired unit tests also provide great potential for RL tuning.

We describe the use of the watsonx Code Assistant (WCA), an LLM-powered coding assistant deployed internally within IBM. Through surveys of two user cohorts (N=669) and unmoderated usability testing (N=15), we examined developers' experiences with WCA and its impact on their productivity. We learned about their motivations for using (or not using) WCA, we examined their expectations of its speed and quality, and we identified new considerations regarding ownership of and responsibility for generated code. Our case study characterizes the impact of an LLM-powered assistant on developers' perceptions of productivity and it shows that although such tools do often provide net productivity increases, these benefits may not always be experienced by all users.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 3 figures.

| **[The Shift from Writing to Pruning Software: A Bonsai-Inspired IDE for Reshaping AI Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02833v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of AI-driven coding assistants signals a fundamental shift in how software is built. While AI coding assistants have been integrated into existing Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), their full potential remains largely untapped. A key challenge is that these AI assistants can suffer from hallucinations, leading developers down decision paths that the AI should not dictate, sometimes even without the users awareness or consent. Moreover, current static-file IDEs lack the mechanisms to address critical issues such as tracking the provenance of AI-generated code and integrating version control in a way that aligns with the dynamic nature of AI-assisted development. As a result, developers are left without the necessary tools to manage, refine, and validate AI generated code systematically, making it difficult to ensure correctness, maintainability, and trust in the development process. Existing IDEs treat AI-generated code as static text, offering limited support for managing its evolution, refinement, or multiple alternative paths. Drawing inspiration from the ancient art of Japanese Bonsai gardening focused on balance, structure, and deliberate pruning: we propose a new approach to IDEs, where AI is allowed to generate in its true, unconstrained form, free from traditional file structures. This approach fosters a more fluid and interactive method for code evolution. We introduce the concept of a Bonsai-inspired IDE, structured as a graph of generated code snippets and multiple code paths, enabling developers to reshape AI generated code to suit their needs. Our vision calls for a shift away from a static file based model toward a dynamic, evolving system that allows for continuous refinement of generated code, with the IDE evolving alongside AI powered modifications rather than merely serving as a place to write and edit code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SE 2030 Software Engineering Roadmap Workshop</p></details> |

We address the problem by developing two new finite blocklength achievability bounds, which we use to benchmark the performance of two coding schemes based on polar codes with outer cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes -- also referred to as CRC-aided (CA) polar codes. The first bound is obtained by considering an outer detection code, whereas the second bound relies on a threshold test applied to the generalized information density. Similarly, in the first CA polar code scheme, we reserve a fraction of the outer CRC parity bits for error detection, whereas in the second scheme, we apply a threshold test (specifically, Forney's optimal rule) to the output of the successive cancellation list decoder. Numerical simulations performed on the binary-input AWGN channel reveal that, in the short-blocklength regime, the threshold-based approach is superior to the CRC-based approach, both in terms of bounds and performance of CA polar code schemes. We also consider the case of decoding with noisy channel-state information, which leads to a mismatched decoding setting. Our results illustrate that, differently from the previous case, in this scenario, the CRC-based approach outperforms the threshold-based approach, which is more sensitive to the mismatch.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in IEEE Trans.

However, existing tools do not sufficiently link the data contexts such as schemas and values with the code being edited. This not only leads to poor code suggestions, but also frequent interruptions in coding processes as users need additional code to locate and understand relevant data. We introduce Xavier, a tool designed to enhance data wrangling script authoring in computational notebooks. Xavier maintains users' awareness of data contexts while providing data-aware code suggestions. It automatically highlights the most relevant data based on the user's code, integrates both code and data contexts for more accurate suggestions, and instantly previews data transformation results for easy verification. To evaluate the effectiveness and usability of Xavier, we conducted a user study with 16 data analysts, showing its potential to streamline data wrangling scripts authoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI'25), April 26-May 1, 2025, Yokohama, Japan</p></details> |
| **[Let the Code LLM Edit Itself When You Edit the Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03157v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we investigate a typical scenario in code generation where a developer edits existing code in real time and requests a code assistant, e.g., a large language model, to re-predict the next token or next line on the fly. Naively, the LLM needs to re-encode the entire KV cache to provide an accurate prediction. However, this process is computationally expensive, especially when the sequence length is long. Simply encoding the edited subsequence and integrating it to the original KV cache meets the temporal confusion problem, leading to significantly worse performance. We address this efficiency and accuracy trade-off by introducing \underline{\textbf{Positional \textbf{I}ntegrity \textbf{E}ncoding} (PIE). Building upon the rotary positional encoding, PIE first removes the rotary matrices in the Key cache that introduce temporal confusion and then reapplies the correct rotary matrices. This process ensures that positional relationships between tokens are correct and requires only a single round of matrix multiplication. We validate the effectiveness of PIE through extensive experiments on the RepoBench-C-8k dataset, utilizing DeepSeek-Coder models with 1.3B, 6.7B, and 33B parameters. Our evaluation includes three real-world coding tasks: code insertion, code deletion, and multi-place code editing. Results demonstrate that PIE reduces computational overhead by over 85% compared to the standard full recomputation approach across all model sizes and tasks while well approximating the model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |
| **[Escalating LLM-based Code Translation Benchmarking into the Class-level Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06145v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have dramatically advanced the performance of automated code translation, making their computational accuracy score reach up to over 80% on many previous benchmarks. However, most code samples in these benchmarks are short, standalone, statement/method-level, and algorithmic, which is not aligned with practical coding tasks. Therefore, it is still unknown the actual capability of LLMs in translating code samples written for daily development. To achieve this, we construct a class-level code translation benchmark, ClassEval-T, and make the first attempt to extensively assess recent LLMs' performance on class-level code translation. ClassEval-T is extended from ClassEval, a well-known class-level Python code generation benchmark consisting of multiple practical coding topics, such as database operation and game design, and diverse contextual dependencies (e.g., fields, methods, and libraries). It cost us 360 person-hours to accomplish the manual migration to Java and C++ with complete code samples and associated test suites. Subsequently, we design three translation strategies (i.e., holistic, min-dependency, and standalone) for class-level code translations and evaluate eight recent LLMs of commercial, general, and code kinds in diverse families and sizes on ClassEval-T. Experimental results demonstrate a remarkable performance drop compared with the most widely studied method-level code translation benchmark, and obvious discrepancies among LLMs appear, showing the effectiveness of ClassEval-T in measuring recent LLMs. Afterwards, we further discuss the usage scenarios for diverse translation strategies and LLMs' ability to dependency awareness when translating class samples. Finally, 1,243 failure cases made by the best-performing LLM under test are analyzed and categorized in this paper for practical guidance and future enlightenment.</p></details> |  |

Their potential in aiding quantum software development remains underexplored, particularly for the PennyLane framework-a leading platform for hybrid quantum-classical computing. To address this gap, we introduce a novel, high-quality dataset comprising 3,347 PennyLane-specific code samples of quantum circuits and their contextual descriptions, specifically curated to train/fine-tune LLM-based quantum code assistance. Our key contributions are threefold: (1) the automatic creation and open-source release of a comprehensive PennyLane dataset leveraging quantum computing textbooks, official documentation, and open-source repositories; (2) the development of a systematic methodology for data refinement, annotation, and formatting to optimize LLM training efficiency; and (3) a thorough evaluation, based on a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) framework, demonstrating the effectiveness of our dataset in streamlining PennyLane code generation and improving quantum development workflows. Compared to existing efforts that predominantly focus on Qiskit, our dataset significantly broadens the spectrum of quantum frameworks covered in AI-driven code assistance. By bridging this gap and providing reproducible dataset-creation methodologies, we aim to advance the field of AI-assisted quantum programming, making quantum computing more accessible to both newcomers and experienced developers.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables, submitted for review under IJCNN 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on Evaluating Large Language Models in Code Generation Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16498v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper provides a comprehensive review of the current methods and metrics used to evaluate the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) in code generation tasks. With the rapid growth in demand for automated software development, LLMs have demonstrated significant potential in the field of code generation. The paper begins by reviewing the historical development of LLMs and their applications in code generation. Next, it details various methods and metrics for assessing the code generation capabilities of LLMs, including code correctness, efficiency, readability, and evaluation methods based on expert review and user experience. The paper also evaluates the widely used benchmark datasets, identifying their limitations and proposing directions for future improvements. Specifically, the paper analyzes the performance of code generation models across different tasks by combining multiple evaluation metrics, such as code compilation/interpretation success rates, unit test pass rates, and performance and efficiency metrics, to comprehensively assess the practical application of LLMs in code generation. Finally, the paper discusses the challenges faced in evaluating LLMs in code generation, particularly how to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of evaluation methods and how to adapt to the evolving practices of software development. These analyses and discussions provide valuable insights for further optimizing and improving the application of LLMs in code generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memorize or Generalize? Evaluating LLM Code Generation with Evolved Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02296v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit a memorization phenomenon in code generation: instead of truly understanding the underlying principles of a programming problem, they tend to memorize the original prompt and its solution together in the training. Consequently, when facing variants of the original problem, their answers very likely resemble the memorized solutions and fail to generalize. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon by designing three evolution strategies to create variants: mutation, paraphrasing, and code-rewriting. By comparing the performance and AST similarity of the LLM-generated codes before and after these three evolutions, we develop a memorization score that positively correlates with the level of memorization. As expected, as supervised fine-tuning goes on, the memorization score rises before overfitting, suggesting more severe memorization. We demonstrate that common mitigation approaches, such as prompt translation and using evolved variants as data augmentation in supervised learning and reinforcement learning, either compromise the performance or fail to alleviate the memorization issue. Therefore, memorization remains a significant challenge in LLM code generation, highlighting the need for a more effective solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[TPIA: Towards Target-specific Prompt Injection Attack against Code-oriented Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09164v5)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, code-oriented large language models (Code LLMs) have been widely and successfully exploited to simplify and facilitate programming. Unfortunately, a few pioneering works revealed that these Code LLMs are vulnerable to backdoor and adversarial attacks. The former poisons the training data or model parameters, hijacking the LLMs to generate malicious code snippets when encountering the trigger. The latter crafts malicious adversarial input codes to reduce the quality of the generated codes. In this paper, we reveal that both attacks have some inherent limitations: backdoor attacks rely on the adversary's capability of controlling the model training process, which may not be practical; adversarial attacks struggle with fulfilling specific malicious purposes. To alleviate these problems, this paper presents a novel attack paradigm against Code LLMs, namely target-specific prompt injection attack (TPIA). TPIA generates non-functional perturbations containing the information of malicious instructions and inserts them into the victim's code context by spreading them into potentially used dependencies (e.g., packages or RAG's knowledge base). It induces the Code LLMs to generate attacker-specified malicious code snippets at the target location. In general, we compress the attacker-specified malicious objective into the perturbation by adversarial optimization based on greedy token search. We collect 13 representative malicious objectives to design 31 threat cases for three popular programming languages. We show that our TPIA can successfully attack three representative open-source Code LLMs (with an attack success rate of up to 97.9%) and two mainstream commercial Code LLM-integrated applications (with an attack success rate of over 90%) in all threat cases, using only a 12-token non-functional perturbation.</p></details> |  |

User studies have shown that some policy classes might be more interpretable than others. However, it is costly to conduct human studies of policy interpretability. Furthermore, there is no clear definition of policy interpretabiliy, i.e., no clear metrics for interpretability and thus claims depend on the chosen definition. We tackle the problem of empirically evaluating policies interpretability without humans. Despite this lack of clear definition, researchers agree on the notions of ''simulatability'': policy interpretability should relate to how humans understand policy actions given states. To advance research in interpretable reinforcement learning, we contribute a new methodology to evaluate policy interpretability. This new methodology relies on proxies for simulatability that we use to conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation of policy interpretability. We use imitation learning to compute baseline policies by distilling expert neural networks into small programs. We then show that using our methodology to evaluate the baselines interpretability leads to similar conclusions as user studies. We show that increasing interpretability does not necessarily reduce performances and can sometimes increase them. We also show that there is no policy class that better trades off interpretability and performance across tasks making it necessary for researcher to have methodologies for comparing policies interpretability.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages of main text, under review</p></details> |

Existing $\textit{end-to-end learning}$ methods for MILP generate values for a subset of decision variables and delegate the remaining problem to traditional MILP solvers. However, this approach often fails to guarantee solution feasibility (i.e., satisfying all constraints) due to inaccurate predictions and primarily focuses on binary decision variables. Satisfying all constraints is a prerequisite for obtaining the optimal solution, and the feasibility issue becomes even more critical with non-binary integer (integer, for short) variables. Thus, addressing the feasibility of MILP involving integer variables is crucial. To address these challenges, we propose a novel reinforcement learning (RL)-based solver that not only finds the first feasible solution but also incrementally discovers better feasible solutions without delegating the remainder to off-the-shelf solvers. Our experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves (near-)optimal solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version (17 pages, 8 figures).

| **[Agentic Bug Reproduction for Effective Automated Program Repair at Google](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01821v2)** | 2025-03-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bug reports often lack sufficient detail for developers to reproduce and fix the underlying defects. Bug Reproduction Tests (BRTs), tests that fail when the bug is present and pass when it has been resolved, are crucial for debugging, but they are rarely included in bug reports, both in open-source and in industrial settings. Thus, automatically generating BRTs from bug reports has the potential to accelerate the debugging process and lower time to repair. This paper investigates automated BRT generation within an industry setting, specifically at Google, focusing on the challenges of a large-scale, proprietary codebase and considering real-world industry bugs extracted from Google's internal issue tracker. We adapt and evaluate a state-of-the-art BRT generation technique, LIBRO, and present our agent-based approach, BRT Agent, which makes use of a fine-tuned Large Language Model (LLM) for code editing. Our BRT Agent significantly outperforms LIBRO, achieving a 28% plausible BRT generation rate, compared to 10% by LIBRO, on 80 human-reported bugs from Google's internal issue tracker. We further investigate the practical value of generated BRTs by integrating them with an Automated Program Repair (APR) system at Google. Our results show that providing BRTs to the APR system results in 30% more bugs with plausible fixes. Additionally, we introduce Ensemble Pass Rate (EPR), a metric which leverages the generated BRTs to select the most promising fixes from all fixes generated by APR system. Our evaluation on EPR for Top-K and threshold-based fix selections demonstrates promising results and trade-offs. For example, EPR correctly selects a plausible fix from a pool of 20 candidates in 70% of cases, based on its top-1 ranking.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Comparison of Cost Functions in Inductive Logic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07554v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent inductive logic programming (ILP) approaches learn optimal hypotheses. An optimal hypothesis minimises a given cost function on the training data. There are many cost functions, such as minimising training error, textual complexity, or the description length of hypotheses. However, selecting an appropriate cost function remains a key question. To address this gap, we extend a constraint-based ILP system to learn optimal hypotheses for seven standard cost functions. We then empirically compare the generalisation error of optimal hypotheses induced under these standard cost functions. Our results on over 20 domains and 1000 tasks, including game playing, program synthesis, and image reasoning, show that, while no cost function consistently outperforms the others, minimising training error or description length has the best overall performance. Notably, our results indicate that minimising the size of hypotheses does not always reduce generalisation error.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fully Autonomous Programming using Iterative Multi-Agent Debugging with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07693v1)** | 2025-03-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program synthesis with Large Language Models (LLMs) suffers from a "near-miss syndrome": the generated code closely resembles a correct solution but fails unit tests due to minor errors. We address this with a multi-agent framework called Synthesize, Execute, Instruct, Debug, and Repair (SEIDR). Effectively applying SEIDR to instruction-tuned LLMs requires determining (a) optimal prompts for LLMs, (b) what ranking algorithm selects the best programs in debugging rounds, and (c) balancing the repair of unsuccessful programs with the generation of new ones. We empirically explore these trade-offs by comparing replace-focused, repair-focused, and hybrid debug strategies. We also evaluate lexicase and tournament selection to rank candidates in each generation. On Program Synthesis Benchmark 2 (PSB2), our framework outperforms both conventional use of OpenAI Codex without a repair phase and traditional genetic programming approaches. SEIDR outperforms the use of an LLM alone, solving 18 problems in C++ and 20 in Python on PSB2 at least once across experiments. To assess generalizability, we employ GPT-3.5 and Llama 3 on the PSB2 and HumanEval-X benchmarks. Although SEIDR with these models does not surpass current state-of-the-art methods on the Python benchmarks, the results on HumanEval-C++ are promising. SEIDR with Llama 3-8B achieves an average pass@100 of 84.2%. Across all SEIDR runs, 163 of 164 problems are solved at least once with GPT-3.5 in HumanEval-C++, and 162 of 164 with the smaller Llama 3-8B. We conclude that SEIDR effectively overcomes the near-miss syndrome in program synthesis with LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in ACM Trans. Evol.

A novel strategy for optimal scheduling of the storage systems of the community members under price-volume demand response programs, is devised. The underlying optimization problem is designed as a low-complexity mixed-integer linear program that scales well with the community size. Once the optimal solution is found, an algorithm for distributing the demand response rewards is introduced in order to guarantee fairness among participants.

However, existing benchmarks lack the ability to automatically evaluate from users' perspective, and also lack the explainability of the results of LLM agents' code generation capabilities. Thus, we introduce ProjectEval, a new benchmark for LLM agents project-level code generation's automated evaluation by simulating user interaction. ProjectEval is constructed by LLM with human reviewing. It has three different level inputs of natural languages or code skeletons. ProjectEval can evaluate the generated projects by user interaction simulation for execution, and by code similarity through existing objective indicators. Through ProjectEval, we find that systematic engineering project code, overall understanding of the project and comprehensive analysis capability are the keys for LLM agents to achieve practical projects. Our findings and benchmark provide valuable insights for developing more effective programming agents that can be deployed in future real-world production.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages (9 Appendix pages), 4 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Program design, like other design activity, is characterized by navigating a space of alternative problem formulations and associated solutions in an iterative fashion. LLMs are potentially powerful tools in helping this exploration; however, by default, code-generation LLMs deliver code that represents a particular point solution. This obscures the larger space of possible alternatives, many of which might be preferable to the LLM's default interpretation and its generated code. We contribute an IDE that supports program design through generating and showing new ways to frame problems alongside alternative solutions, tracking design decisions, and identifying implicit decisions made by either the programmer or the LLM. In a user study, we find that with our IDE, users combine and parallelize design phases to explore a broader design space -- but also struggle to keep up with LLM-originated changes to code and other information overload. These findings suggest a core challenge for future IDEs that support program design through higher-level instructions given to LLM-based agents: carefully managing attention and deciding what information agents should surface to program designers and when.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages; 4 figures; 1 table; to appear in CHI '25</p></details> |

We have discovered that our assistant can recognize students' conceptual difficulties and provide ideas, plans, and template code in pedagogically appropriate ways. However, among other mistakes, it occasionally incorrectly labels the correct student code as incorrect or encourages students to use correct-but-lesson-inappropriate approaches, which can lead to long and frustrating journeys for the students.

| **[Exploring and Lifting the Robustness of LLM-powered Automated Program Repair with Metamorphic Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07516v2)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Large language model-powered Automated Program Repair (LAPR) techniques have achieved state-of-the-art bug-fixing performance and have been pervasively applied and studied in both industry and academia. Nonetheless, LLMs were proved to be highly sensitive to input prompts, with slight differences in the expressions of semantically equivalent programs potentially causing repair failures. Therefore, it is crucial to conduct robustness testing on LAPR techniques before their practical deployment. However, related research is scarce. To this end, we propose MT-LAPR, a Metamorphic Testing framework exclusively for LAPR techniques, which summarizes nine widely-recognized Metamorphic Relations (MRs) by developers across three perturbation levels: token, statement, and block. Afterward, our proposed MRs are applied to buggy codes to generate test cases, which are semantically equivalent yet to affect the inference of LAPR. Experiments are carried out on two extensively examined bug-fixing datasets, i.e., Defect4J and QuixBugs, and four bug-fixing abled LLMs released recently, demonstrating that 34.4% - 48.5% of the test cases expose the instability of LAPR techniques on average, showing the effectiveness of MT-LAPR and uncovering a positive correlation between code readability and the robustness of LAPR techniques. Inspired by the above findings, this paper uses the test cases generated by MT-LAPR as samples to train a CodeT5-based code editing model aiming at improving code readability and then embeds it into the LAPR workflow as a data preprocessing step. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the robustness of LAPR by 49.32% at most.</p></details> |  |
| **[Less is More: Adaptive Program Repair with Bug Localization and Preference Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.06510v1)** | 2025-03-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) is a task to automatically generate patches for the buggy code. However, most research focuses on generating correct patches while ignoring the consistency between the fixed code and the original buggy code. How to conduct adaptive bug fixing and generate patches with minimal modifications have seldom been investigated. To bridge this gap, we first introduce a novel task, namely AdaPR (Adaptive Program Repair). We then propose a two-stage approach AdaPatcher (Adaptive Patch Generator) to enhance program repair while maintaining the consistency. In the first stage, we utilize a Bug Locator with self-debug learning to accurately pinpoint bug locations. In the second stage, we train a Program Modifier to ensure consistency between the post-modified fixed code and the pre-modified buggy code. The Program Modifier is enhanced with a location-aware repair learning strategy to generate patches based on identified buggy lines, a hybrid training strategy for selective reference and an adaptive preference learning to prioritize fewer changes. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms a set of baselines by a large margin, validating the effectiveness of our two-stage framework for the newly proposed AdaPR task.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by AAAI2025 Oral</p></details> |

Our proposal relaxes the constraint in WORMHOLES that restricts all resources to single-use. Resources are categorized into two kinds: input/output resources and internal resources. Input/output resources model interactions with the environment and follow constraints similar to those in WORMHOLES. Internal resources, on the other hand, enable communication between program components and can be used multiple times. We demonstrate that programs written in our language can be translated into equivalent effect-free YAMPA programs, ensuring that our approach remains compatible with existing functional reactive paradigms.</p></details> |  |

However, there are few available tools today that can be used to rigorously bound errors in programs that employ conditional statements (a basic need) as well as mixed-precision arithmetic (a direction of significant future interest) employing global optimization in error analysis. In this paper, we present a new tool that fills this void while also employing an abstraction-guided optimization approach to allow designers to trade error-bound tightness for gains in analysis time -- useful when searching for design alternatives. We first present the basic rigorous analysis framework of Satire and then show how to extend it to incorporate abstractions, conditionals, and mixed-precision arithmetic. We begin by describing Satire's design and its performance on a collection of benchmark examples. We then describe these aspects of Satire: (1) how the error-bound and tool execution time vary with the abstraction level; (2) the additional machinery to handle conditional expression branches, including defining the concepts of instability jumps and instability window widths and measuring these quantities; and (3) how the error changes when a mix of precision values are used. To showcase how \satire can add value during design, we start with a Conjugate Gradient solver and demonstrate how its step size and search direction are affected by different precision settings. Satire is freely available for evaluation, and can be used during the design of numerical routines to effect design tradeoffs guided by rigorous empirical error guarantees.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pg...</summary><p>22 pgs, 8 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Data-Driven Invariant Learning for Probabilistic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05421v4)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Morgan and McIver's weakest pre-expectation framework is one of the most well-established methods for deductive verification of probabilistic programs. Roughly, the idea is to generalize binary state assertions to real-valued expectations, which can measure expected values of probabilistic program quantities. While loop-free programs can be analyzed by mechanically transforming expectations, verifying loops usually requires finding an invariant expectation, a difficult task. We propose a new view of invariant expectation synthesis as a regression problem: given an input state, predict the average value of the post-expectation in the output distribution. Guided by this perspective, we develop the first data-driven invariant synthesis method for probabilistic programs. Unlike prior work on probabilistic invariant inference, our approach can learn piecewise continuous invariants without relying on template expectations, and also works with black-box access to the program. We also develop a data-driven approach to learn sub-invariants from data, which can be used to upper- or lower-bound expected values. We implement our approaches and demonstrate their effectiveness on a variety of benchmarks from the probabilistic programming literature.</p></details> | 37 pages |
| **[Parameterized Algorithms for Matching Integer Programs with Additional Rows and Columns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05548v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study integer linear programs (ILP) of the form $\min\{c^\top x\ \vert\ Ax=b,l\le x\le u,x\in\mathbb Z^n\}$ and analyze their parameterized complexity with respect to their distance to the generalized matching problem--following the well-established approach of capturing the hardness of a problem by the distance to triviality. The generalized matching problem is an ILP where each column of the constraint matrix has $1$-norm of at most $2$. It captures several well-known polynomial time solvable problems such as matching and flow problems. We parameterize by the size of variable and constraint backdoors, which measure the least number of columns or rows that must be deleted to obtain a generalized matching ILP. We present the following results: (i) a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm for ILPs parameterized by the size $p$ of a minimum variable backdoor to generalized matching; (ii) a randomized slice-wise polynomial (XP) time algorithm for ILPs parameterized by the size $h$ of a minimum constraint backdoor to generalized matching as long as $c$ and $A$ are encoded in unary; (iii) we complement (ii) by proving that solving an ILP is W[1]-hard when parameterized by $h$ even when $c,A,l,u$ have coefficients of constant size. To obtain (i), we prove a variant of lattice-convexity of the degree sequences of weighted $b$-matchings, which we study in the light of SBO jump M-convex functions. This allows us to model the matching part as a polyhedral constraint on the integer backdoor variables. The resulting ILP is solved in FPT time using an integer programming algorithm. For (ii), the randomized XP time algorithm is obtained by pseudo-polynomially reducing the problem to the exact matching problem. To prevent an exponential blowup in terms of the encoding length of $b$, we bound the Graver complexity of the constraint matrix and employ a Graver augmentation local search framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Static Program Analysis Guided LLM Based Unit Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05394v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a novel approach to automating unit test generation for Java methods using large language models (LLMs). Existing LLM-based approaches rely on sample usage(s) of the method to test (focal method) and/or provide the entire class of the focal method as input prompt and context. The former approach is often not viable due to the lack of sample usages, especially for newly written focal methods. The latter approach does not scale well enough; the bigger the complexity of the focal method and larger associated class, the harder it is to produce adequate test code (due to factors such as exceeding the prompt and context lengths of the underlying LLM). We show that augmenting prompts with \emph{concise} and \emph{precise} context information obtained by program analysis %of the focal method increases the effectiveness of generating unit test code through LLMs. We validate our approach on a large commercial Java project and a popular open-source Java project.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hints-In-Browser: Benchmarking Language Models for Programming Feedback Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05053v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI and large language models hold great promise in enhancing programming education by generating individualized feedback and hints for learners. Recent works have primarily focused on improving the quality of generated feedback to achieve human tutors' quality. While quality is an important performance criterion, it is not the only criterion to optimize for real-world educational deployments. In this paper, we benchmark language models for programming feedback generation across several performance criteria, including quality, cost, time, and data privacy. The key idea is to leverage recent advances in the new paradigm of in-browser inference that allow running these models directly in the browser, thereby providing direct benefits across cost and data privacy. To boost the feedback quality of small models compatible with in-browser inference engines, we develop a fine-tuning pipeline based on GPT-4 generated synthetic data. We showcase the efficacy of fine-tuned Llama3-8B and Phi3-3.8B 4-bit quantized models using WebLLM's in-browser inference engine on three different Python programming datasets. We will release the full implementation along with a web app and datasets to facilitate further research on in-browser language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Logical Content of Logic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05355v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logic programming (LP) is typically understood through operational semantics (e.g., SLD-resolution) or model-theoretic interpretations (e.g., the least Herbrand model). This paper introduces a novel perspective on LP by defining a ``support'' relation that explicates what a program ``knows''. This interpretation is shown to express classical and intuitionistic logic, as well as an intermediate logic, depending on certain choices regarding LP and the meanings of disjunction and negation. These results are formalized using the idea of base-extension semantics within proof-theoretic semantics. Our approach offers new insights into the logical foundations of LP and has potential applications in knowledge representation, automated reasoning, and formal verification.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoIOT: LLM-Driven Automated Natural Language Programming for AIoT Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05346v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has profoundly transformed our lives, revolutionizing interactions with AI and lowering the barrier to AI usage. While LLMs are primarily designed for natural language interaction, the extensive embedded knowledge empowers them to comprehend digital sensor data. This capability enables LLMs to engage with the physical world through IoT sensors and actuators, performing a myriad of AIoT tasks. Consequently, this evolution triggers a paradigm shift in conventional AIoT application development, democratizing its accessibility to all by facilitating the design and development of AIoT applications via natural language. However, some limitations need to be addressed to unlock the full potential of LLMs in AIoT application development. First, existing solutions often require transferring raw sensor data to LLM servers, which raises privacy concerns, incurs high query fees, and is limited by token size. Moreover, the reasoning processes of LLMs are opaque to users, making it difficult to verify the robustness and correctness of inference results. This paper introduces AutoIOT, an LLM-based automated program generator for AIoT applications. AutoIOT enables users to specify their requirements using natural language (input) and automatically synthesizes interpretable programs with documentation (output). AutoIOT automates the iterative optimization to enhance the quality of generated code with minimum user involvement. AutoIOT not only makes the execution of AIoT tasks more explainable but also mitigates privacy concerns and reduces token costs with local execution of synthesized programs. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate AutoIOT's remarkable capability in program synthesis for various AIoT tasks. The synthesized programs can match and even outperform some representative baselines.</p></details> |  |

As quantum technologies advance toward industrial adoption, understanding programming aspects is crucial to addressing software development challenges. This study analyzes 6,935 quantum software programming discussion posts from Stack Exchange platforms (Quantum Computing, Stack Overflow, Software Engineering, and Code Review). Using topic modeling and qualitative analysis, we identified key discussion topics, trends (popular and difficult), tools/frameworks, and practitioner challenges. Twenty topics were identified, including popular ones such as physical theories and mathematical foundations, as well as security and encryption algorithms, while the most difficult were object-oriented programming and parameter control in quantum algorithms. Additionally, we identified nine frameworks that support quantum programming, with Qiskit emerging as the most widely adopted. Our findings also reveal core challenges in quantum software programming, thematically mapped into four areas: theories and mathematical concepts, algorithms and applications, experimental practices and software development, and education and community engagement. This study provides empirical insights that can inform future research, tool development, and educational efforts, supporting the evolution of the quantum software ecosystem.</p></details> |  |
| **[ESSPI: ECDSA/Schnorr Signed Program Input for BitVMX](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02772v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The BitVM and BitVMX protocols have long relied on inefficient one-time signature (OTS) schemes like Lamport and Winternitz for signing program inputs. These schemes exhibit significant storage overheads, hindering their practical application. This paper introduces ESSPI, an optimized method leveraging ECDSA/Schnorr signatures to sign the BitVMX program input. With Schnorr signatures we achieve an optimal 1:1 data expansion, compared to the current known best ratio of 1:200 based on Winternitz signatures. To accomplish this we introduce 4 innovations to BitVMX: (1) a modification of the BitVMX CPU, adding a challengeable hashing core to it, (2) a new partition-based search to detect fraud during hashing, (3) a new enhanced transaction DAG with added data-carrying transactions with a fraud-verifying smart-contract and (4) a novel timelock-based method for proving data availability to Bitcoin smart contracts. The enhanced BitVMX protocol enables the verification of uncompressed inputs such as SPV proofs, NiPoPoWs, or longer computation integrity proofs, such as STARKs.</p></details> |  |

The proposed `Word2Wave' (W2W) framework enables interactive programming and parameter configuration of AUVs for remote subsea missions. The W2W framework includes: (i) a set of novel language rules and command structures for efficient language-to-mission mapping; (ii) a GPT-based prompt engineering module for training data generation; (iii) a small language model (SLM)-based sequence-to-sequence learning pipeline for mission command generation from human speech or text; and (iv) a novel user interface for 2D mission map visualization and human-machine interfacing. The proposed learning pipeline adapts an SLM named T5-Small that can learn language-to-mission mapping from processed language data effectively, providing robust and efficient performance. In addition to a benchmark evaluation with state-of-the-art, we conduct a user interaction study to demonstrate the effectiveness of W2W over commercial AUV programming interfaces. Across participants, W2W-based programming required less than 10\% time for mission programming compared to traditional interfaces; it is deemed to be a simpler and more natural paradigm for subsea mission programming with a usability score of 76.25. W2W opens up promising future research opportunities on hands-free AUV mission programming for efficient subsea deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modular Reasoning about Error Bounds for Concurrent Probabilistic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04512v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Coneris, the first higher-order concurrent separation logic for reasoning about error probability bounds of higher-order concurrent probabilistic programs with higher-order state. To support modular reasoning about concurrent (non-probabilistic) program modules, state-of-the-art program logics internalize the classic notion of linearizability within the logic through the concept of logical atomicity. Coneris extends this idea to probabilistic concurrent program modules. Thus Coneris supports modular reasoning about probabilistic concurrent modules by capturing a novel notion of randomized logical atomicity within the logic. To do so, Coneris utilizes presampling tapes and a novel probabilistic update modality to describe how state is changed probabilistically at linearization points. We demonstrate this approach by means of smaller synthetic examples and larger case studies. All of the presented results, including the meta-theory, have been mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant and the Iris separation logic framework</p></details> |  |

Empirical observations show that current systems tend to produce incomplete next object location distributions. We introduce a system which addresses this problem. We design a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that specifies functional constraints. Programs from our language take as input a partial scene and object to place. Upon execution they predict possible object placements. We design a generative model which writes these programs automatically. Available 3D scene datasets do not contain programs to train on, so we build upon previous work in unsupervised program induction to introduce a new program bootstrapping algorithm. In order to quantify our empirical observations we introduce a new evaluation procedure which captures how well a system models per-object location distributions. We ask human annotators to label all the possible places an object can go in a scene and show that our system produces per-object location distributions more consistent with human annotators. Our system also generates indoor scenes of comparable quality to previous systems and while previous systems degrade in performance when training data is sparse, our system does not degrade to the same degree.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 20 figures Subjects: Graphics (cs.GR), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Machine Learning (cs.LG)</p></details> |

This highlights a need to teach students how to effectively interact with AI models, particularly through natural language prompts, to generate and critically evaluate code for solving computational tasks. To address this, we developed a novel platform for prompt programming that enables authentic dialogue-based interactions, supports problems involving multiple interdependent functions, and offers on-request execution of generated code. Data analysis from over 900 students in an introductory programming course revealed high engagement, with the majority of prompts occurring within multi-turn dialogues. Problems with multiple interdependent functions encouraged iterative refinement, with progression graphs highlighting several common strategies. Students were highly selective about the code they chose to test, suggesting that on-request execution of generated code promoted critical thinking. Given the growing importance of learning dialogue-based programming with AI, we provide this tool as a publicly accessible resource, accompanied by a corpus of programming problems for educational use.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of the ITiCSE'25 paper</p></details> |

Developers increasingly use them for their work, including generating code to fulfil the data protection requirements (privacy) of the apps they build. We wanted to know if the reality is the same as expectations of AI-based programming assistants when trying to fulfil software privacy requirements, and the challenges developers face when using AI-based programming assistants and how these can be improved. To this end, we conducted a survey with 51 developers worldwide. We found that AI-based programming assistants need to be improved in order for developers to better trust them with generating code that ensures privacy. In this paper, we provide some practical recommendations for developers to consider following when using AI-based programming assistants for privacy-related code development, and some key further research directions.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Memory-Safe WebAssembly (MSWASM) is introduced as a general-purpose intermediate bytecode with built-in memory safety semantics. Programs written in C can be compiled into MSWASM to get complete memory safety protection. In this paper, we present our extensions on MSWASM, which improve its semantics and practicality. First, we formalize MSWASM semantics in Coq/Iris, extending it with inter-module interaction, showing that MSWASM provides fine-grained isolation guarantees analogous to WASM's coarse-grained isolation via linear memory. Second, we present Aegis, a system to adopt the memory safety of MSWASM for C programs in an interoperable way. Aegis pipeline generates Checked C source code from MSWASM modules to enforce spatial memory safety. Checked C is a recent binary-compatible extension of C which can provide guaranteed spatial safety. Our design allows Aegis to protect C programs that depend on legacy C libraries with no extra dependency and with low overhead. Aegis pipeline incurs 67% runtime overhead and near-zero memory overhead on PolyBenchC programs compared to native.</p></details> |  |

However, a central problem remains: translating theoretical ideas into robust implementations in the highly specialized context of pharmaceutical research. This limitation prevents practitioners from making full use of the latest AI developments in drug discovery. To address this challenge, we introduce DrugAgent, a multi-agent framework that automates machine learning (ML) programming for drug discovery tasks. DrugAgent employs an LLM Planner that formulates high-level ideas and an LLM Instructor that identifies and integrates domain knowledge when implementing those ideas. We present case studies on three representative drug discovery tasks. Our results show that DrugAgent consistently outperforms leading baselines, including a relative improvement of 4.92% in ROC-AUC compared to ReAct for drug-target interaction (DTI).

For the overall system dynamics, a two-degrees-of-freedom (2-DOF) vehicle model is established and a two-point preview driver model is adopted. A dynamic authority allocation strategy based on cooperation level is proposed to combine the steering input of the human driver and the automatic controller. To make further improvements in the controller design, three main contributions are put forward. Firstly, the CNF controller is designed for trajectory tracking control with refined transient performance. Besides, the self-triggered rule is applied such that the system will update in discrete times to save computing resources and increase efficiency. Moreover, by introducing the data-based ADP algorithm, the optimal control problem can be solved through iteration using system input and output information, reducing the need for accurate knowledge of system dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is validated through Carsim-Simulink co-simulations in diverse driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics (12 pages)</p></details> |

Specifically, we design a domain-specific language (DSL) to hierarchically represent building structures as a program, which can be efficiently converted into a mesh. We bridge feedforward and inverse procedural modeling by using a feedforward process for training data synthesis, allowing the network to make reverse predictions. We train an encoder-decoder on the points-program pairs to establish a mapping from unstructured point clouds to architectural programs, where a 3D convolutional encoder extracts point cloud features and a transformer decoder autoregressively predicts the programs in a tokenized form. Inference by our method is highly efficient and produces plausible and faithful 3D abstractions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ArcPro outperforms both traditional architectural proxy reconstruction and learning-based abstraction methods. We further explore its potential to work with multi-view image and natural language inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 (Patent Protected); Project page: https://vcc.tech/research/2025/ArcPro</p></details> |

The while-language we consider is a simple computation model that can simulate (and be simulated by) Turing machines with a linear time and constant space blow-up. Our framework derives while-programs from functional programs written in a subset of Isabelle/HOL, namely tail-recursive functions with first-order arguments and algebraic datatypes. As far as we are aware, it is the first framework targeting a computation model that is reasonable in time and space from a complexity-theoretic perspective.</p></details> |  |

Whereas semantic models for languages with either concurrency or randomization are well studied, their combination is limited to languages with bounded loops. Our work is the first to consider both randomization and concurrency for a language with unbounded looping constructs. The interaction between Boolean tests (arising from the control flow structures), probabilistic actions, and concurrent execution creates challenges in generalizing previous work on pomsets and convex languages, prominent models for those effects, individually. To illustrate the generality of our model, we show that it recovers a typical powerdomain semantics for concurrency, as well as the convex powerset semantics for probabilistic nondeterminism.</p></details> |  |

Exploring and Evaluating the Design and Trade-offs of Proactive AI Programming Support](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18658v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI programming tools enable powerful code generation, and recent prototypes attempt to reduce user effort with proactive AI agents, but their impact on programming workflows remains unexplored. We introduce and evaluate Codellaborator, a design probe LLM agent that initiates programming assistance based on editor activities and task context. We explored three interface variants to assess trade-offs between increasingly salient AI support: prompt-only, proactive agent, and proactive agent with presence and context (Codellaborator). In a within-subject study (N=18), we find that proactive agents increase efficiency compared to prompt-only paradigm, but also incur workflow disruptions. However, presence indicators and interaction context support alleviated disruptions and improved users' awareness of AI processes. We underscore trade-offs of Codellaborator on user control, ownership, and code understanding, emphasizing the need to adapt proactivity to programming processes. Our research contributes to the design exploration and evaluation of proactive AI systems, presenting design implications on AI-integrated programming workflow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Various Software Artifacts for Better LLM-based Bug Localization and Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03905v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. The source code and experimental results of this work for replication are available at https://github.com/XYZboom/DEVLoRe.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 11 images, 9 tables, Manuscript submitted to a journal (2024)</p></details> |

Subsequently,a multi-stage dynamic programming decision model is constructed.This involves defining the state transition functions and stage-specific objective functions,followed by obtaining six optimal decision strategies under various conditions through backward recursion.The results demonstrate the model's potent capability for multi-stage decision-making and its high interpretability,offering significant advantages in practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages ,2 figures ,published by ICIRDC 2024</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Robot Programming: Mixed Reality Gripper Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02042v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional robot programming methods are complex and time-consuming for users. In recent years, alternative approaches such as mixed reality have been explored to address these challenges and optimize robot programming. While the findings of the mixed reality robot programming methods are convincing, most existing methods rely on gesture interaction for robot programming. Since controller-based interactions have proven to be more reliable, this paper examines three controller-based programming methods within a mixed reality scenario: 1) Classical Jogging, where the user positions the robot's end effector using the controller's thumbsticks, 2) Direct Control, where the controller's position and orientation directly corresponds to the end effector's, and 3) Gripper Control, where the controller is enhanced with a 3D-printed gripper attachment to grasp and release objects. A within-subjects study (n = 30) was conducted to compare these methods. The findings indicate that the Gripper Control condition outperforms the others in terms of task completion time, user experience, mental demand, and task performance, while also being the preferred method. Therefore, it demonstrates promising potential as an effective and efficient approach for future robot programming.

As individual network sizes quickly scale beyond the dimensional capabilities of single crossbars, networks must be mapped onto multiple crossbars. Crossbar sizes within modern Memristor Crossbar Architectures are determined predominately not by device technology but by network topology; more, smaller crossbars consume less area thanks to the high structural sparsity found in larger, brain-inspired SNNs. Motivated by continuing increases in SNN sparsity due to improvements in training methods, we propose utilizing heterogeneous crossbar sizes to further reduce area consumption. This approach was previously unachievable as prior compiler studies only explored solutions targeting homogeneous MCAs. Our work improves on the state-of-the-art by providing Integer Linear Programming formulations supporting arbitrarily heterogeneous architectures. By modeling axonal interactions between neurons our methods produce better mappings while removing inhibitive a priori knowledge requirements. We first show a 16.7-27.6% reduction in area consumption for square-crossbar homogeneous architectures. Then, we demonstrate 66.9-72.7% further reduction when using a reasonable configuration of heterogeneous crossbar dimensions. Next, we present a new optimization formulation capable of minimizing the number of inter-crossbar routes. When applied to solutions already near-optimal in area an 11.9-26.4% routing reduction is observed without impacting area consumption. Finally, we present a profile-guided optimization capable of minimizing the number of runtime spikes between crossbars. Compared to the best-area-then-route optimized solutions we observe a further 0.5-14.8% inter-crossbar spike reduction while requiring 1-3 orders of magnitude less solver time.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in DATE'25</p></details> |
| **[Predicting post-release defects with knowledge units (KUs) of programming languages: an empirical study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02907v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Defect prediction plays a crucial role in software engineering, enabling developers to identify defect-prone code and improve software quality. While extensive research has focused on refining machine learning models for defect prediction, the exploration of new data sources for feature engineering remains limited. Defect prediction models primarily rely on traditional metrics such as product, process, and code ownership metrics, which, while effective, do not capture language-specific traits that may influence defect proneness. To address this gap, we introduce Knowledge Units (KUs) of programming languages as a novel feature set for analyzing software systems and defect prediction. A KU is a cohesive set of key capabilities that are offered by one or more building blocks of a given programming language. We conduct an empirical study leveraging 28 KUs that are derived from Java certification exams and compare their effectiveness against traditional metrics in predicting post-release defects across 8 well-maintained Java software systems. Our results show that KUs provide significant predictive power, achieving a median AUC of 0.82, outperforming individual group of traditional metric-based models. Among KU features, Method & Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Exception Handling emerge as the most influential predictors. Furthermore, combining KUs with traditional metrics enhances prediction performance, yielding a median AUC of 0.89. We also introduce a cost-effective model using only 10 features, which maintains strong predictive performance while reducing feature engineering costs. Our findings demonstrate the value of KUs in predicting post-release defects, offering a complementary perspective to traditional metrics. This study can be helpful to researchers who wish to analyze software systems from a perspective that is complementary to that of traditional metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Apollo-MILP: An Alternating Prediction-Correction Neural Solving Framework for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01129v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging machine learning (ML) to predict an initial solution for mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has gained considerable popularity in recent years. These methods predict a solution and fix a subset of variables to reduce the problem dimension. Then, they solve the reduced problem to obtain the final solutions. However, directly fixing variable values can lead to low-quality solutions or even infeasible reduced problems if the predicted solution is not accurate enough. To address this challenge, we propose an Alternating prediction-correction neural solving framework (Apollo-MILP) that can identify and select accurate and reliable predicted values to fix. In each iteration, Apollo-MILP conducts a prediction step for the unfixed variables, followed by a correction step to obtain an improved solution (called reference solution) through a trust-region search. By incorporating the predicted and reference solutions, we introduce a novel Uncertainty-based Error upper BOund (UEBO) to evaluate the uncertainty of the predicted values and fix those with high confidence. A notable feature of Apollo-MILP is the superior ability for problem reduction while preserving optimality, leading to high-quality final solutions. Experiments on commonly used benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed Apollo-MILP significantly outperforms other ML-based approaches in terms of solution quality, achieving over a 50% reduction in the solution gap.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Memory Recycling for Large Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00822v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As quantum computing technology advances, the complexity of quantum algorithms increases, necessitating a shift from low-level circuit descriptions to high-level programming paradigms. This paper addresses the challenges of developing a compilation algorithm that optimizes memory management and scales well for bigger, more complex circuits. Our approach models the high-level quantum code as a control flow graph and presents a workflow that searches for a topological sort that maximizes opportunities for qubit reuse. Various heuristics for qubit reuse strategies handle the trade-off between circuit width and depth. We also explore scalability issues in large circuits, suggesting methods to mitigate compilation bottlenecks. By analyzing the structure of the circuit, we are able to identify sub-problems that can be solved separately, without a significant effect on circuit quality, while reducing runtime significantly. This method lays the groundwork for future advancements in quantum programming and compiler optimization by incorporating scalability into quantum memory management.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Mixed-Integer Conic Program for the Multi-Agent Moving-Target Traveling Salesman Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.06130v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Moving-Target Traveling Salesman Problem (MT-TSP) seeks a shortest path for an agent that starts at a stationary depot, visits a set of moving targets exactly once, each within one of their respective time windows, and returns to the depot. In this paper, we introduce a new Mixed-Integer Conic Program (MICP) formulation for the Multi-Agent Moving-Target Traveling Salesman Problem (MA-MT-TSP), a generalization of the MT-TSP involving multiple agents. Our approach begins by restating the current state-of-the-art MICP formulation for MA-MT-TSP as a Nonconvex Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP), followed by a novel reformulation into a new MICP. We present computational results demonstrating that our formulation outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving up to two orders of magnitude reduction in runtime, and over 90% improvement in optimality gap.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |
| **[GPIoT: Tailoring Small Language Models for IoT Program Synthesis and Development](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00686v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code Large Language Models (LLMs) enhance software development efficiency by automatically generating code and documentation in response to user requirements. However, code LLMs cannot synthesize specialized programs when tasked with IoT applications that require domain knowledge. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a promising solution by fetching relevant domain knowledge, it necessitates powerful cloud LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) to process user requirements and retrieved contents, which raises significant privacy concerns. This approach also suffers from unstable networks and prohibitive LLM query costs. Moreover, it is challenging to ensure the correctness and relevance of the fetched contents. To address these issues, we propose GPIoT, a code generation system for IoT applications by fine-tuning locally deployable Small Language Models (SLMs) on IoT-specialized datasets. SLMs have smaller model sizes, allowing efficient local deployment and execution to mitigate privacy concerns and network uncertainty. Furthermore, by fine-tuning the SLMs with our IoT-specialized datasets, the SLMs' ability to synthesize IoT-related programs can be substantially improved. To evaluate GPIoT's capability in synthesizing programs for IoT applications, we develop a benchmark, IoTBench. Extensive experiments and user trials demonstrate the effectiveness of GPIoT in generating IoT-specialized code, outperforming state-of-the-art code LLMs with an average task accuracy increment of 64.7% and significant improvements in user satisfaction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Show Me Why It's Correct: Saving 1/3 of Debugging Time in Program Repair with Interactive Runtime Comparison](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00618v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) holds the promise of alleviating the burden of debugging and fixing software bugs. Despite this, developers still need to manually inspect each patch to confirm its correctness, which is tedious and time-consuming. This challenge is exacerbated in the presence of plausible patches, which accidentally pass test cases but may not correctly fix the bug. To address this challenge, we propose an interactive approach called iFix to facilitate patch understanding and comparison based on their runtime difference. iFix performs static analysis to identify runtime variables related to the buggy statement and captures their runtime values during execution for each patch. These values are then aligned across different patch candidates, allowing users to compare and contrast their runtime behavior. To evaluate iFix, we conducted a within-subjects user study with 28 participants. Compared with manual inspection and a state-of-the-art interactive patch filtering technique, iFix reduced participants' task completion time by 36% and 33% while also improving their confidence by 50% and 20%, respectively. Besides, quantitative experiments demonstrate that iFix improves the ranking of correct patches by at least 39% compared with other patch ranking methods and is generalizable to different APR tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 8 figures, OOPSLA 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learning Task Decomposition to Assist Humans in Competitive Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04604v4)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When using language models (LMs) to solve complex problems, humans might struggle to understand the LM-generated solutions and repair the flawed ones. To assist humans in repairing them, we propose to automatically decompose complex solutions into multiple simpler pieces that correspond to specific subtasks. We introduce a novel objective for learning task decomposition, termed assistive value (AssistV), which measures the feasibility and speed for humans to repair the decomposed solution. We collect a dataset of human repair experiences on different decomposed solutions. Utilizing the collected data as in-context examples, we then learn to critique, refine, and rank decomposed solutions to improve AssistV. We validate our method under competitive programming problems: under 177 hours of human study, our method enables non-experts to solve 33.3\% more problems, speeds them up by 3.3x, and empowers them to match unassisted experts.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2024 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[LTLf Synthesis on First-Order Agent Programs in Nondeterministic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.00726v3)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the synthesis of policies for high-level agent programs expressed in Golog, a language based on situation calculus that incorporates nondeterministic programming constructs. Unlike traditional approaches for program realization that assume full agent control or rely on incremental search, we address scenarios where environmental nondeterminism significantly influences program outcomes. Our synthesis problem involves deriving a policy that successfully realizes a given Golog program while ensuring the satisfaction of a temporal specification, expressed in Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf), across all possible environmental behaviors. By leveraging an expressive class of first-order action theories, we construct a finite game arena that encapsulates program executions and tracks the satisfaction of the temporal goal. A game-theoretic approach is employed to derive such a policy. Experimental results demonstrate this approach's feasibility in domains with unbounded objects and non-local effects. This work bridges agent programming and temporal logic synthesis, providing a framework for robust agent behavior in nondeterministic environments.</p></details> | AAAI'25 |
| **[Learner and Instructor Needs in AI-Supported Programming Learning Tools: Design Implications for Features and Adaptive Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00144v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-supported tools can help learners overcome challenges in programming education by providing adaptive assistance. However, existing research often focuses on individual tools rather than deriving broader design recommendations. A key challenge in designing these systems is balancing learner control with system-driven guidance. To explore user preferences for AI-supported programming learning tools, we conducted a participatory design study with 15 undergraduate novice programmers and 10 instructors to gather insights on their desired help features and control preferences, as well as a follow-up survey with 172 introductory programming students. Our qualitative findings show that learners prefer help that is encouraging, incorporates visual aids, and includes peer-related insights, whereas instructors prioritize scaffolding that reflects learners' progress and reinforces best practices. Both groups favor shared control, though learners generally prefer more autonomy, while instructors lean toward greater system guidance to prevent cognitive overload. Additionally, our interviews revealed individual differences in control preferences. Based on our findings, we propose design guidelines for AI-supported programming tools, particularly regarding user-centered help features and adaptive control mechanisms. Our work contributes to the human-centered design of AI-supported learning environments by informing the development of systems that effectively balance autonomy and guidance, enhancing AI-supported educational tools for programming and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Consistent Are Humans When Grading Programming Assignments?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12967v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Providing consistent summative assessment to students is important, as the grades they are awarded affect their progression through university and future career prospects. While small cohorts are typically assessed by a single assessor, such as the class leader, larger cohorts are often assessed by multiple assessors, which increases the risk of inconsistent grading. To investigate the consistency of human grading of programming assignments, we asked 28 participants to each grade 40 CS1 introductory Java assignments, providing grades and feedback for correctness, code elegance, readability and documentation; the 40 assignments were split into two batches of 20. In the second batch of 20, we duplicated one assignment from the first to analyse the internal consistency of individual assessors. We measured the inter-rater reliability of the groups using Krippendorf's $\alpha$ -- an $\alpha > 0.667$ is recommended to make tentative conclusions based on the rating. Our groups were inconsistent, with an average $\alpha = 0.2$ when grading correctness and an average $\alpha < 0.1$ for code elegance, readability and documentation. To measure the individual consistency of graders, we measured the distance between the grades they awarded for the duplicated assignment in batch one and batch two. Only one participant of the 22 who didn't notice that the assignment was a duplicate was awarded the same grade for correctness, code elegance, readability and documentation. The average grade difference was 1.79 for correctness and less than 1.6 for code elegance, readability and documentation. Our results show that human graders in our study can not agree on the grade to give a piece of student work and are often individually inconsistent, suggesting that the idea of a ``gold standard'' of human grading might be flawed, and highlights that a shared rubric alone is not enough to ensure consistency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Need Help? Designing Proactive AI Assistants for Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.04596v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While current chat-based AI assistants primarily operate reactively, responding only when prompted by users, there is significant potential for these systems to proactively assist in tasks without explicit invocation, enabling a mixed-initiative interaction. This work explores the design and implementation of proactive AI assistants powered by large language models. We first outline the key design considerations for building effective proactive assistants. As a case study, we propose a proactive chat-based programming assistant that automatically provides suggestions and facilitates their integration into the programmer's code. The programming context provides a shared workspace enabling the assistant to offer more relevant suggestions. We conducted a randomized experimental study examining the impact of various design elements of the proactive assistant on programmer productivity and user experience. Our findings reveal significant benefits of incorporating proactive chat assistants into coding environments and uncover important nuances that influence their usage and effectiveness.</p></details> | CHI 2025 |

In this work, we extend the offloading capability to quantum computers. We explain the necessary changes to the Clang compiler and the Nanos6 runtime, which are both part of OmpSs-2. In addition, we develop a simulator that simulates a quantum computer in the network and receives the jobs offloaded by the runtime. Four detailed examples show how our programming model can be used to write hybrid quantum-classical software. The examples are random number generation, a parameter scan using the mean-field ansatz, a variational algorithm using this ansatz, and handwritten digit recognition using a hybrid convolutional neural network.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models in Competitive Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20868v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o3 and DeepSeek-R1 emerging, large language models (LLMs) have entered a new phase of development. However, existing benchmarks for coding evaluation are gradually inadequate to assess the capability of advanced LLMs in code reasoning. To bridge the gap for high-level code reasoning assessment, we propose ProBench to benchmark LLMs in competitive programming, drawing inspiration from the International Collegiate Programming Contest. ProBench collects a comprehensive set of competitive programming problems from Codeforces, Luogu, and Nowcoder platforms during the period from July to December 2024, obtaining real test results through online submissions to ensure the fairness and accuracy of the evaluation. We establish a unified problem attribute system, including difficulty grading and algorithm tagging. With carefully collected and annotated data in ProBench, we systematically assess 9 latest LLMs in competitive programming across multiple dimensions, including thought chain analysis, error type diagnosis, and reasoning depth evaluation. Experimental results show that QwQ-32B-Preview achieves the best score of 20.93 followed by DeepSeek-V3 with a score of 16.38, suggesting that models trained with specialized reasoning tasks significantly outperform general-purpose models (even larger than reasoning-oriented models) in programming. Further analysis also reveals key areas for programming capability enhancement, e.g., algorithm adaptability and reasoning sufficiency, providing important insights for the future development of reasoning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing the Design Space: Parallel Versions for Exploratory Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20535v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploratory programming involves open-ended tasks. To evaluate their progress on these, programmers require frequent feedback and means to tell if the feedback they observe is bringing them in the right direction. Collecting, comparing, and sharing feedback is typically done through ad-hoc means: relying on memory to compare outputs, code comments, or manual screenshots. To approach this issue, we designed Exploriants: an extension to example-based live programming. Exploriants allows programmers to place variation points. It collects outputs captured in probes and presents them in a comparison view that programmers can customize to suit their program domain. We find that the addition of variation points and the comparisons view encourages a structured approach to exploring variations of a program. We demonstrate Exploriants' capabilities and applicability in three case studies on image processing, data processing, and game development. Given Exploriants, exploratory programmers are given a straightforward means to evaluate their progress and do not have to rely on ad-hoc methods that may introduce errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistent Distributed Reactive Programming with Retroactive Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20534v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Many systems require receiving data from multiple information sources, which act as distributed network devices that asynchronously send the latest data at their own pace to generalize various kinds of devices and connections, known as the Internet of Things (IoT). These systems often perform computations both **reactively** and **retroactively** on information received from the sources for monitoring and analytical purposes, respectively. Inquiry: It is challenging to design a programming language that can describe such systems at a high level of abstraction for two reasons: (1) reactive and retroactive computations in these systems are performed alongside the execution of other application logic; and (2) information sources may be distributed, and data from these sources may arrive late or be lost entirely. Addressing these difficulties is our fundamental problem. Approach: We propose a programming language that supports the following features. First, our language incorporates reactive time-varying values (also known as signals) embedded within an imperative language. Second, it supports multiple information sources that are distributed and represented as signals, meaning they can be declaratively composed to form other time-varying values. Finally, it allows computation over past values collected from information sources and recovery from inconsistency caused by packet loss. To address the aforementioned difficulties, we develop a core calculus for this proposed language. Knowledge: This calculus is a hybrid of reactive/retroactive computations and imperative ones. Because of this hybrid nature, the calculus is inherently complex; however, we have simplified it as much as possible. First, its semantics are modeled as a simple, single-threaded abstraction based on typeless object calculus. Meanwhile, reactive computations that execute in parallel are modeled using a simple process calculus and are integrated with the object calculus, ensuring that the computation results are always serialized. Specifically, we show that time consistency is guaranteed in the calculus; in other words, consistency can be recovered at any checkpoint. Grounding: This work is supported by formally stating and proving theorems regarding time consistency. We also conducted a microbenchmarking experiment to demonstrate that the implemented recovery process is feasible in our assumed application scenarios. Importance: The ensured time consistency provides a rigorous foundation for performing analytics on computation results obtained from distributed information sources, even when these sources experience delays or packet loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Program Slices Change How Developers Diagnose Gradual Run-Time Type Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20533v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A gradual type system allows developers to declare certain types to be enforced by the compiler (i.e., statically typed), while leaving other types to be enforced via runtime checks (i.e., dynamically typed). When runtime checks fail, debugging gradually typed programs becomes cumbersome, because these failures may arise far from the original point where an inconsistent type assumption is made. To ease this burden on developers, some gradually typed languages produce a blame report for a given type inconsistency. However, these reports are sometimes misleading, because they might point to program points that do not need to be changed to stop the error. To overcome the limitations of blame reports, we propose using dynamic program slicing as an alternative approach to help programmers debug run-time type errors. We describe a proof-of-concept for TypeSlicer, a tool that would present dynamic program slices to developers when a runtime check fails. We performed a Wizard-of-Oz user study to investigate how developers respond to dynamic program slices through a set of simulated interactions with TypeScript programs. This formative study shows that developers can understand and apply dynamic slice information to provide change recommendations when debugging runtime type errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Supervised Fine-Tuning LLMs to Behave as Pedagogical Agents in Programming Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20527v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored in higher education, yet their effectiveness as teaching agents remains underexamined. In this paper, we present the development of GuideLM, a fine-tuned LLM designed for programming education. GuideLM has been integrated into the Debugging C Compiler (DCC), an educational C compiler that leverages LLMs to generate pedagogically sound error explanations. Previously, DCC relied on off-the-shelf OpenAI models, which, while accurate, often over-assisted students by directly providing solutions despite contrary prompting. To address this, we employed supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a dataset of 528 student-question/teacher-answer pairs, creating two models: GuideLM and GuideLM-mini, fine-tuned on ChatGPT-4o and 4o-mini, respectively. We conducted an expert analysis of 400 responses per model, comparing their pedagogical effectiveness against base OpenAI models. Our evaluation, grounded in constructivism and cognitive load theory, assessed factors such as conceptual scaffolding, clarity, and Socratic guidance. Results indicate that GuideLM and GuideLM-mini improve pedagogical performance, with an 8% increase in Socratic guidance and a 58% improvement in economy of words compared to GPT-4o. However, this refinement comes at the cost of a slight reduction in general accuracy. While further work is needed, our findings suggest that fine-tuning LLMs with targeted datasets is a promising approach for developing models better suited to educational contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two Approaches for Programming Education in the Domain of Graphics: An Experiment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20526v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Graphics is a popular domain for teaching introductory programming in a motivating way, even in text-based programming languages. Over the last few decades, a large number of libraries using different approaches have been developed for this purpose. Inquiry: Prior work in introductory programming that uses graphics as input and output has shown positive results in terms of engagement, but research is scarce on whether learners are able to use programming concepts learned through graphics for programming in other domains, transferring what they have learned. Approach: We conducted a randomized, controlled experiment with 145 students as participants divided into two groups. Both groups programmed using graphics in Python, but used different approaches: one group used a compositional graphics library named PyTamaro; the other used the Turtle graphics library from Python's standard library. Student engagement was assessed with surveys, and programming knowledge with a post-test on general programming concepts and programming tasks in the domain of graphics. Knowledge: We find few differences between the two groups on the post-test, despite the PyTamaro group having practiced on problems isomorphic to those in the post-test. The participants traced a compositional graphics program more accurately than a 'comparable' turtle graphics program. Both groups report high engagement and perceived learning; both perform well on simple program-writing tasks to create graphics. Grounding: Our findings are based on a controlled experiment with a count of 145 participants, which exceeds the sample size indicated by power analysis to detect a medium effect size. The complete instrument and teaching materials used in the study are available as appendixes. Importance: This study adds further evidence that graphics is an engaging domain for introductory programming; moreover, it shows that the compositional graphics approach adopted by PyTamaro yields engagement levels comparable to the venerable turtle approach. Compositional graphics code appears to be easier to trace than turtle graphics code. As for conceptual knowledge, our results indicate that practicing on programming tasks isomorphic to those of the test can still not be enough to achieve better transfer. This challenges programming educators and researchers to investigate further which graphics-based approaches work best and how to facilitate transfer.</p></details> |  |

We introduce LangProBe, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating the architectures and optimization strategies for language programs, with over 2000 combinations of tasks, architectures, optimizers, and choices of LMs. Using LangProBe, we are the first to study the impact of program architectures and optimizers (and their compositions together and with different models) on tradeoffs of quality and cost. We find that optimized language programs offer strong cost--quality Pareto improvement over raw calls to models, but simultaneously demonstrate that human judgment (or empirical decisions) about which compositions to pursue is still necessary for best performance. We will open source the code and evaluation data for LangProBe.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bugfix: a standard language, database schema and repository for research on bugs and automatic program repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15599v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Program Repair (APR) is a brilliant idea: when detecting a bug, also provide suggestions for correcting the program. Progress towards that goal is hindered by the absence of a common frame of reference for the multiplicity of APR ideas, methods, tools, programming languages and environments. Bugfix is an effort at providing such a framework: a standardized set of notations, tools and interfaces, as well as a database of bugs and fixes, for use by the APR research community to try out ideas and compare results. The most directly visible component of the Bugfix effort is the Bugfix language, a human-readable formalism making it possible to describe elements of the following kinds: a bug (described abstractly, for example the permutation of two arguments in a call); a bug example (an actual occurrence of a bug, in a specific code written in a specific programming language, and usually recorded in some repository); a fix (a particular correction of a bug, obtained for example by reversing the misplaced arguments); an application (an entity that demonstrates how a actual code example matches with a fix); a construct (the abstract description of a programming mechanism, for example a ``while'' loop, independently of its realization in a programming language; and a language (a description of how a particular programming language includes certain constructs and provides specific concrete syntax for each of them -- for example Java includes loop, assignment etc. and has a defined format for each of them). A JSON API provides it in a form accessible to tools. Bugfix includes a repository containing a considerable amount of bugs, examples and fixes. Note: An early step towards this article was a short contribution (Ref [1]) to the 2024 ICSE. The present text reuses a few elements of introduction and motivation but is otherwise thoroughly reworked and extended.</p></details> |  |
| **[Program Synthesis Dialog Agents for Interactive Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19610v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world eligibility problems, ranging from medical diagnosis to tax planning, can be mapped to decision problems expressed in natural language, wherein a model must make a binary choice based on user features. Large-scale domains such as legal codes or frequently updated funding opportunities render human annotation (e.g., web forms or decision trees) impractical, highlighting the need for agents that can automatically assist in decision-making. Since relevant information is often only known to the user, it is crucial that these agents ask the right questions. As agents determine when to terminate a conversation, they face a trade-off between accuracy and the number of questions asked, a key metric for both user experience and cost. To evaluate this task, we propose BeNYfits, a new benchmark for determining user eligibility for multiple overlapping social benefits opportunities through interactive decision-making. Our experiments show that current language models struggle with frequent hallucinations, with GPT-4o scoring only 35.7 F1 using a ReAct-style chain-of-thought. To address this, we introduce ProADA, a novel approach that leverages program synthesis to assist in decision-making by mapping dialog planning to a code generation problem and using gaps in structured data to determine the best next action. Our agent, ProADA, improves the F1 score to 55.6 while maintaining nearly the same number of dialog turns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Language Probabilistic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19538v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are many different probabilistic programming languages that are specialized to specific kinds of probabilistic programs. From a usability and scalability perspective, this is undesirable: today, probabilistic programmers are forced up-front to decide which language they want to use and cannot mix-and-match different languages for handling heterogeneous programs. To rectify this, we seek a foundation for sound interoperability for probabilistic programming languages: just as today's Python programmers can resort to low-level C programming for performance, we argue that probabilistic programmers should be able to freely mix different languages for meeting the demands of heterogeneous probabilistic programming environments. As a first step towards this goal, we introduce \textsc{MultiPPL}, a probabilistic multi-language that enables programmers to interoperate between two different probabilistic programming languages: one that leverages a high-performance exact discrete inference strategy, and one that uses approximate importance sampling. We give a syntax and semantics for \textsc{MultiPPL}, prove soundness of its inference algorithm, and provide empirical evidence that it enables programmers to perform inference on complex heterogeneous probabilistic programs and flexibly exploits the strengths and weaknesses of two languages simultaneously.%</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at OOPSLA 2025 (R1)</p></details> |

To provide correctness guarantees for the client, we propose adapting the cryptographic notion of refereed delegation to the machine learning setting. This approach enables a computationally limited client to delegate a program to multiple untrusted compute providers, with a guarantee of obtaining the correct result if at least one of them is honest. Refereed delegation of ML programs poses two technical hurdles: (1) an arbitration protocol to resolve disputes when compute providers disagree on the output, and (2) the ability to bitwise reproduce ML programs across different hardware setups, For (1), we design Verde, a dispute arbitration protocol that efficiently handles the large scale and graph-based computational model of modern ML programs. For (2), we build RepOps (Reproducible Operators), a library that eliminates hardware "non-determinism" by controlling the order of floating point operations performed on all hardware. Our implementation shows that refereed delegation achieves both strong guarantees for clients and practical overheads for compute providers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundations for Deductive Verification of Continuous Probabilistic Programs: From Lebesgue to Riemann and Back](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19388v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We lay out novel foundations for the computer-aided verification of guaranteed bounds on expected outcomes of imperative probabilistic programs featuring (i) general loops, (ii) continuous distributions, and (iii) conditioning. To handle loops we rely on user-provided quantitative invariants, as is well established. However, in the realm of continuous distributions, invariant verification becomes extremely challenging due to the presence of integrals in expectation-based program semantics. Our key idea is to soundly under- or over-approximate these integrals via Riemann sums. We show that this approach enables the SMT-based invariant verification for programs with a fairly general control flow structure. On the theoretical side, we prove convergence of our Riemann approximations, and establish coRE-completeness of the central verification problems. On the practical side, we show that our approach enables to use existing automated verifiers targeting discrete probabilistic programs for the verification of programs involving continuous sampling. Towards this end, we implement our approach in the recent quantitative verification infrastructure Caesar by encoding Riemann sums in its intermediate verification language. We present several promising case studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of OOPSLA 25 paper, 55 pages</p></details> |

To achieve increasingly more responsive behaviors upon interactions without relying on centralized computation, embodying memory directly in the machines' structure is crucial. Here, we harness the bistability of elastic shells to alter the fluidic properties of an enclosed cavity, thereby switching between stable frequency states of a locomoting self-oscillating machine. To program these memory states upon interactions, we develop fluidic circuits surrounding the bistable shell, with soft tubes that kink and unkink when externally touched. We implement circuits for both long-term and short-term memory in a soft machine that switches behaviors in response to a human user and that autonomously changes direction after detecting a wall. By harnessing only geometry and elasticity, embodying memory allows physical structures without a central brain to exhibit autonomous feats that are typically reserved for computer-based robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[DBox: Scaffolding Algorithmic Programming Learning through Learner-LLM Co-Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19133v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decomposition is a fundamental skill in algorithmic programming, requiring learners to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. However, current self-study methods, such as browsing reference solutions or using LLM assistants, often provide excessive or generic assistance that misaligns with learners' decomposition strategies, hindering independent problem-solving and critical thinking. To address this, we introduce Decomposition Box (DBox), an interactive LLM-based system that scaffolds and adapts to learners' personalized construction of a step tree through a "learner-LLM co-decomposition" approach, providing tailored support at an appropriate level. A within-subjects study (N=24) found that compared to the baseline, DBox significantly improved learning gains, cognitive engagement, and critical thinking. Learners also reported a stronger sense of achievement and found the assistance appropriate and helpful for learning. Additionally, we examined DBox's impact on cognitive load, identified usage patterns, and analyzed learners' strategies for managing system errors. We conclude with design implications for future AI-powered tools to better support algorithmic programming education.</p></details> |  |
| **[Homomorphic Encryption of Intuitionistic Logic Proofs and Functional Programs: A Categorical Approach Inspired by Composite-Order Bilinear Groups](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05779v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a conceptual framework for extending homomorphic encryption beyond arithmetic or Boolean operations into the domain of intuitionistic logic proofs and, by the Curry-Howard correspondence, into the domain of typed functional programs. We begin by reviewing well-known homomorphic encryption schemes for arithmetic operations, and then discuss the adaptation of similar concepts to support logical inference steps in intuitionistic logic. Key to our construction are polynomial functors and Bounded Natural Functors (BNFs), which serve as a categorical substrate on which logic formulas and proofs are represented and manipulated. We outline a complexity-theoretic hardness assumption -- the BNF Distinguishing Problem, constructed via a reduction from Subgraph Isomorphism, providing a foundation for cryptographic security. Finally, we describe how these methods can homomorphically encode the execution of total, dependently typed functional programs, and outline strategies for making the approach potentially efficient, including software optimizations and hardware acceleration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Better Understanding of Program-of-Thought Reasoning in Cross-Lingual and Multilingual Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17956v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-step reasoning is essential for large language models (LLMs), yet multilingual performance remains challenging. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning, it struggles with non-English languages due to the entanglement of reasoning and execution. Program-of-Thought (PoT) prompting separates reasoning from execution, offering a promising alternative but shifting the challenge to generating programs from non-English questions. We propose a framework to evaluate PoT by separating multilingual reasoning from code execution to examine (i) the impact of fine-tuning on question-reasoning alignment and (ii) how reasoning quality affects answer correctness. Our findings demonstrate that PoT fine-tuning substantially enhances multilingual reasoning, outperforming CoT fine-tuned models. We further demonstrate a strong correlation between reasoning quality (measured through code quality) and answer accuracy, highlighting its potential as a test-time performance improvement heuristic.</p></details> |  |
| **[The AI Definition and a Program Which Satisfies this Definition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03184v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We will consider all policies of the agent and will prove that one of them is the best performing policy. While that policy is not computable, computable policies do exist in its proximity. We will define AI as a computable policy which is sufficiently proximal to the best performing policy. Before we can define the agent's best performing policy, we need a language for description of the world. We will also use this language to develop a program which satisfies the AI definition. The program will first understand the world by describing it in the selected language. The program will then use the description in order to predict the future and select the best possible move. While this program is extremely inefficient and practically unusable, it can be improved by refining both the language for description of the world and the algorithm used to predict the future. This can yield a program which is both efficient and consistent with the AI definition.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpecGen: Automated Generation of Formal Program Specifications via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08807v5)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal program specifications play a crucial role in various stages of software development. However, manually crafting formal program specifications is rather difficult, making the job time-consuming and labor-intensive. It is even more challenging to write specifications that correctly and comprehensively describe the semantics of complex programs. To reduce the burden on software developers, automated specification generation methods have emerged. However, existing methods usually rely on predefined templates or grammar, making them struggle to accurately describe the behavior and functionality of complex real-world programs. To tackle this challenge, we introduce SpecGen, a novel technique for formal program specification generation based on Large Language Models. Our key insight is to overcome the limitations of existing methods by leveraging the code comprehension capability of LLMs. The process of SpecGen consists of two phases. The first phase employs a conversational approach that guides the LLM to generate appropriate specifications for a given program. The second phase, designed for where the LLM fails to generate correct specifications, applies four mutation operators to the model-generated specifications and selects verifiable specifications from the mutated ones through a novel heuristic selection strategy. We evaluate SpecGen on two datasets, including the SV-COMP Java category benchmark and a manually constructed dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that SpecGen succeeds in generating verifiable specifications for 279 out of 385 programs, outperforming the existing purely LLM-based approaches and conventional specification generation tools like Houdini and Daikon. Further investigations on the quality of generated specifications indicate that SpecGen can comprehensively articulate the behaviors of the input program.</p></details> |  |

Collaborative programming emerges as an effective method for instructors to support novice students in developing coding and teamwork abilities. However, due to limited class time and attention, instructors face challenges in monitoring and evaluating the progress and performance of groups or individuals. To address this issue, we collect multimodal data from real-world settings and develop CPVis, an interactive visual analytics system designed to assess student collaboration dynamically. Specifically, CPVis enables instructors to evaluate both group and individual performance efficiently. CPVis employs a novel flower-based visual encoding to represent performance and provides time-based views to capture the evolution of collaborative behaviors. A within-subject experiment (N=22), comparing CPVis with two baseline systems, reveals that users gain more insights, find the visualization more intuitive, and report increased confidence in their assessments of collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Programming with Pixels: Computer-Use Meets Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18525v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in software engineering (SWE) agents have largely followed a $\textit{tool-based paradigm}$, where agents interact with hand-engineered tool APIs to perform specific tasks. While effective for specialized tasks, these methods fundamentally lack generalization, as they require predefined tools for each task and do not scale across programming languages and domains. We introduce $\texttt{Programming with Pixels}$ (PwP), an agent environment that unifies software development tasks by enabling $\textit{computer-use agents}$-agents that operate directly within an IDE through visual perception, typing, and clicking, rather than relying on predefined tool APIs. To systematically evaluate these agents, we propose $\texttt{PwP-Bench}$, a benchmark that unifies existing SWE benchmarks spanning tasks across multiple programming languages, modalities, and domains under a task-agnostic state and action space. Our experiments demonstrate that general-purpose computer-use agents can approach or even surpass specialized tool-based agents on a variety of SWE tasks without the need for hand-engineered tools. However, our analysis shows that current models suffer from limited visual grounding and fail to exploit many IDE tools that could simplify their tasks. When agents can directly access IDE tools, without visual interaction, they show significant performance improvements, highlighting the untapped potential of leveraging built-in IDE capabilities. Our results establish PwP as a scalable testbed for building and evaluating the next wave of software engineering agents.

As large language models that can generate code have become widely available, scientists may increasingly use these models during research software development. We investigate the characteristics of scientists who are early-adopters of code generating models and conduct interviews with scientists at a public, research-focused university. Through interviews and reviews of user interaction logs, we see that scientists often use code generating models as an information retrieval tool for navigating unfamiliar programming languages and libraries. We present findings about their verification strategies and discuss potential vulnerabilities that may emerge from code generation practices unknowingly influencing the parameters of scientific analyses.</p></details> | Accepted to CHI 2025 |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning With Preference Optimization For Visual Program Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16529v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual programming languages (VPLs) allow users to create programs through graphical interfaces, which results in easier accessibility and their widespread usage in various domains. To further enhance this accessibility, recent research has focused on generating VPL code from user instructions using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, by employing prompting-based methods, these studies have shown promising results. Nevertheless, such approaches can be less effective for industrial VPLs such as Ladder Diagram (LD). LD is a pivotal language used in industrial automation processes and involves extensive domain-specific configurations, which are difficult to capture in a single prompt. In this work, we demonstrate that training-based methods outperform prompting-based methods for LD generation accuracy, even with smaller backbone models. Building on these findings, we propose a two-stage training strategy to further enhance VPL generation. First, we employ retrieval-augmented fine-tuning to leverage the repetitive use of subroutines commonly seen in industrial VPLs. Second, we apply direct preference optimization (DPO) to further guide the model toward accurate outputs, using systematically generated preference pairs through graph editing operations. Extensive experiments on real-world LD data demonstrate that our approach improves program-level accuracy by over 10% compared to supervised fine-tuning, which highlights its potential to advance industrial automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor Network Structure Search Using Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02711v2)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor networks provide a powerful framework for compressing multi-dimensional data. The optimal tensor network structure for a given data tensor depends on both the inherent data properties and the specific optimality criteria, making tensor network structure search a crucial research problem. Existing solutions typically involve sampling and validating numerous candidate structures; this is computationally expensive, limiting their practical applications. We address this challenge by formulating tensor network structure search as a program synthesis problem and proposing a highly efficient validation method that is based on constraint solving. Specifically, we design a domain specific language: it builds the correspondence between programs and network structures, and uses a novel idea of output-directed splits to compress the search space without hindering the expressiveness. We then propose a synthesis algorithm that can prioritize promising candidates through constraint solving. % Experimental results show that our approach improves search speed by $10\times$ and achieves compression ratios by $1.5\times$ to $3\times$ better than state-of-the-art. Notably, our approach scales to larger tensors that are out of reach by prior work. Finally, we demonstrate that the discovered topologies generalize to data from the same source, achieving compression ratios up to $ 2.4\times$ better than hierarchical Tuckers while maintaining the runtime around $110$ seconds.</p></details> |  |

This model marks the first variable-gain ZNN to collectively manifest strictly predefined-time convergence and noise resilience, specifically tailored for kinematic motion control of robots. The SPTC-AN-FOZNN advances traditional ZNNs by incorporating a conformable fractional derivative in accordance with the Leibniz rule, a compliance not commonly achieved by other fractional derivative definitions. It also features a novel activation function designed to ensure favorable convergence independent of the model's order. When compared to five recently published recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the SPTC-AN-FOZNN, configured with $0<\alpha\leq 1$, exhibits superior positional accuracy and robustness against additive noises for TVQP applications. Extensive empirical evaluations, including simulations with two types of robotic manipulators and experiments with a Flexiv Rizon robot, have validated the SPTC-AN-FOZNN's effectiveness in precise tracking and computational efficiency, establishing its utility for robust kinematic control.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures; as accepted for publication</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Reason About Program Semantics? A Comprehensive Evaluation of LLMs on Formal Specification Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04779v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to automate programming tasks. Yet, LLMs' capabilities in reasoning about program semantics are still inadequately studied, leaving significant potential for further exploration. This paper introduces FormalBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities on program semantics, particularly via the task of synthesizing formal program specifications to assist verifying program correctness. This task requires both comprehensive reasoning over all possible program executions (i.e., \textit{completeness}) and the generation of precise, syntactically correct expressions that adhere to formal syntax and semantics (i.e., \textit{consistency}). Using this benchmark, we evaluated the ability of LLMs in synthesizing consistent and complete specifications. Our findings show that LLMs perform well with simple control flows but struggle with more complex structures, especially loops, even with advanced prompting. Additionally, LLMs exhibit limited robustness against semantic-preserving transformations. We also highlight common failure patterns and design self-repair prompts, improving success rates by 25%.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Stepwise Distillation Learning Strategy for Non-differentiable Visual Programming Frameworks on Visual Reasoning Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09809v3)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Visual Programming (VProg) has emerged as a significant framework for visual reasoning (VR) tasks due to its interpretability and cross-task generality. However, even with invoking powerful pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) as visual sub-modules, the performance of VProg on specific VR tasks is markedly inferior compared to well-trained task-specific networks. Although invoking task-specific models can further enhance the performance of VProg on specific VR tasks, it greatly diminishes the cross-task generalization ability of VProg. Besides, the non-differentiable nature of VProg prevents direct fine-tuning on specific VR tasks for further performance improvement. Attempt to address these issues, we propose SDVP, a Stepwise Distillation learning strategy for non-differentiable VPorg across various VR tasks. Specifically, our SDVP stepwise distills the capabilities of existing, well-trained small task-specific models for decomposed visual sub-tasks in VProg into the much larger VLMs invoked by corresponding visual sub-modules. Besides, distilling the knowledge of little-size task-specific models into pre-trained larger VLMs rather than replacing them helps keep the cross-task abilities of VProgs. Extensive and comprehensive experimental results on different VProg frameworks demonstrate that our SDVP obtains significant performance gains on specific VR benchmarks, i.e., GQA (+2.4\%) and NLVRv2 (+6.2\%) for VisProg and GQA (+6.5\%) and NLVRv2 (+4.0\%) for ViperGPT, and also maintains a promising performance for VProg on unseen and previous VR tasks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Foundation Models for Mixed Integer Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08288v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is essential for modeling complex decision-making problems but faces challenges in computational tractability and requires expert formulation. Current deep learning approaches for MILP focus on specific problem classes and do not generalize to unseen classes. To address this shortcoming, we take a foundation model training approach, where we train a single deep learning model on a diverse set of MILP problems to generalize across problem classes. As existing datasets for MILP lack diversity and volume, we introduce MILP-Evolve, a novel LLM-based evolutionary framework that is capable of generating a large set of diverse MILP classes with an unlimited amount of instances. We study our methodology on three key learning tasks that capture diverse aspects of MILP: (1) integrality gap prediction, (2) learning to branch, and (3) a new task of aligning MILP instances with natural language descriptions. Our empirical results show that models trained on the data generated by MILP-Evolve achieve significant improvements on unseen problems, including MIPLIB benchmarks. Our work highlights the potential of moving towards a foundation model approach for MILP that can generalize to a broad range of MILP applications. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/OptiGuide.</p></details> |  |

This paper reviews 103 studies on resource allocation strategies in 5G and B5G, focusing specifically on optimization problems modelled as LP, ILP, and MILP. The selected studies are categorized based on network architectures, types of resource allocation problems, and specific objective functions and constraints. The review also discusses solution methods for NP-hard ILP and MILP problems by categorizing the solution methods into different categories. Additionally, emerging trends, such as integrating AI and machine learning with optimization models, are explored, suggesting promising future research directions in network optimization. The paper concludes that LP, ILP, and MILP models have been widely adopted across various network architectures, resource types, objective functions, and constraints and remain critical to optimizing next-generation networks.</p></details> |  |
