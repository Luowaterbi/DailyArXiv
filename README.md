| **[Blank Space: Adaptive Causal Coding for Streaming Communications Over Multi-Hop Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11984v3)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce Blank Space AC-RLNC (BS), a novel Adaptive and Causal Network Coding (AC-RLNC) solution designed to mitigate the triplet trade-off between throughput-delay-efficiency in multi-hop networks. BS leverages the network's physical limitations considering the bottleneck from each node to the destination. In particular, BS introduces a light-computational re-encoding algorithm, called Network AC-RLNC (NET), implemented independently at intermediate nodes. NET adaptively adjusts the Forward Error Correction (FEC) rates and schedules idle periods. It incorporates two distinct suspension mechanisms: 1) Blank Space Period, accounting for the forward-channels bottleneck, and 2) No-New No-FEC approach, based on data availability. The experimental results achieve significant improvements in resource efficiency, demonstrating a 20% reduction in channel usage compared to baseline RLNC solutions. Notably, these efficiency gains are achieved while maintaining competitive throughput and delay performance, ensuring improved resource utilization does not compromise network performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multilevel lattice codes from Hurwitz quaternion integers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10773v3)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents an extension of the Construction $\pi_A$ lattices proposed in \cite{huang2017construction}, to Hurwitz quaternion integers. This construction is provided by using an isomorphism from a version of the Chinese remainder theorem applied to maximal orders in contrast to natural orders in prior works. Exploiting this map, we analyze the performance of the resulting multilevel lattice codes, highlight via computer simulations their notably reduced computational complexity provided by the multistage decoding. Moreover it is shown that this construction effectively attain the Poltyrev-limit.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Code Graph Model (CGM): A Graph-Integrated Large Language Model for Repository-Level Software Engineering Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16901v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in function-level code generation, yet repository-level software engineering tasks remain challenging. Current solutions predominantly rely on proprietary LLM agents, which introduce unpredictability and limit accessibility, raising concerns about data privacy and model customization. This paper investigates whether open-source LLMs can effectively address repository-level tasks without requiring agent-based approaches. We demonstrate this is possible by enabling LLMs to comprehend functions and files within codebases through their semantic information and structural dependencies. To this end, we introduce Code Graph Models (CGMs), which integrate repository code graph structures into the LLM's attention mechanism and map node attributes to the LLM's input space using a specialized adapter. When combined with an agentless graph RAG framework, our approach achieves a 43.00% resolution rate on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark using the open-source Qwen2.5-72B model. This performance ranks first among open weight models, second among methods with open-source systems, and eighth overall, surpassing the previous best open-source model-based method by 12.33%.</p></details> | 31 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Bounds on $k$-hash distances and rates of linear codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05239v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we bound the rate of linear codes in $\mathbb{F}_q^n$ with the property that any $k\leq q$ codewords are all simultaneously distinct in at least $d_k$ coordinates. For the particular case $d_k=1$, this leads to bounds on the rate of linear $q$-ary $k$-hash codes which generalize, with a simpler proof, results recently obtained for the case $q=k=3$ by Pohoata and Zakharov and by Bishnoi, D'haeseleer, Gijswijt and Potukuchi. We finally discuss some related open problems on the list-decoding zero-error capacity of discrete memoryless channels.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2401.16288</p></details> |
| **[Towards Machine-Generated Code for the Resolution of User Intentions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17531v3)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt a reassessment of the interaction mechanisms between users and their devices. Currently, users are required to use a set of high-level applications to achieve their desired results. However, the advent of AI may signal a shift in this regard, as its capabilities have generated novel prospects for user-provided intent resolution through the deployment of model-generated code. This development represents a significant progression in the realm of hybrid workflows, where human and artificial intelligence collaborate to address user intentions, with the former responsible for defining these intentions and the latter for implementing the solutions to address them. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of generating and executing workflows through code generation that results from prompting an LLM with a concrete user intention, and a simplified application programming interface for a GUI-less operating system. We provide an in-depth analysis and comparison of various user intentions, the resulting code, and its execution. The findings demonstrate the general feasibility of our approach and that the employed LLM, GPT-4o-mini, exhibits remarkable proficiency in the generation of code-oriented workflows in accordance with provided user intentions.</p></details> |  |
| **[ASMA-Tune: Unlocking LLMs' Assembly Code Comprehension via Structural-Semantic Instruction Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11617v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assembly code analysis and comprehension play critical roles in applications like reverse engineering, yet they face substantial challenges due to low information density and a lack of explicit syntactic structures. While traditional masked language modeling (MLM) approaches do not explicitly focus on natural language interaction, emerging decoder-focused large language models (LLMs) demonstrate partial success in binary analysis yet remain underexplored for holistic comprehension. We present Assembly Augmented Tuning, an end-to-end structural-semantic instruction tuning framework that synergizes encoder architecture with decoder-based LLMs through a projector module, where the assembly encoder extracts hardware-level structural features, the projector bridges representations with the semantic space, and the instruction-tuned LLM preserves natural language capabilities. Experimental results demonstrate three key advantages: (1) State-of-the-art performance in assembly comprehension with +39.7% Recall@1 and +17.8% MRR improvements over GPT-4-Turbo, (2) Consistent enhancements across base models (24.6-107.4% Recall@1 and 15.2-106.3% MRR on Qwen2.5-Coder, Deepseek-Coder and CodeLlama variants), and (3) Superior instruction-following capabilities (41.5%-118% improvements) with controlled code generation degradation (-8.9% to -35% across architectures).</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, multiple figures</p></details> |
| **[AutoMCQ -- Automatically Generate Code Comprehension Questions using GenAI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16430v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Students often do not fully understand the code they have written. This sometimes does not become evident until later in their education, which can mean it is harder to fix their incorrect knowledge or misunderstandings. In addition, being able to fully understand code is increasingly important in a world where students have access to generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) tools, such as GitHub Copilot. One effective solution is to utilise code comprehension questions, where a marker asks questions about a submission to gauge understanding, this can also have the side effect of helping to detect plagiarism. However, this approach is time consuming and can be difficult and/or expensive to scale. This paper introduces AutoMCQ, which uses GenAI for the automatic generation of multiple-choice code comprehension questions. This is integrated with the CodeRunner automated assessment platform.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking Smarter Device Control: Foresighted Planning with a World Model-Driven Code Execution Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16422v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The automatic control of mobile devices is essential for efficiently performing complex tasks that involve multiple sequential steps. However, these tasks pose significant challenges due to the limited environmental information available at each step, primarily through visual observations. As a result, current approaches, which typically rely on reactive policies, focus solely on immediate observations and often lead to suboptimal decision-making. To address this problem, we propose \textbf{Foresighted Planning with World Model-Driven Code Execution (FPWC)},a framework that prioritizes natural language understanding and structured reasoning to enhance the agent's global understanding of the environment by developing a task-oriented, refinable \emph{world model} at the outset of the task. Foresighted actions are subsequently generated through iterative planning within this world model, executed in the form of executable code. Extensive experiments conducted in simulated environments and on real mobile devices demonstrate that our method outperforms previous approaches, particularly achieving a 44.4\% relative improvement in task success rate compared to the state-of-the-art in the simulated environment. Code and demo are provided in the supplementary material.</p></details> |  |
| **[UBGAN: Enhancing Coded Speech with Blind and Guided Bandwidth Extension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16404v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In practical application of speech codecs, a multitude of factors such as the quality of the radio connection, limiting hardware or required user experience necessitate trade-offs between achievable perceptual quality, engendered bitrate and computational complexity. Most conventional and neural speech codecs operate on wideband (WB) speech signals to achieve this compromise. To further enhance the perceptual quality of coded speech, bandwidth extension (BWE) of the transmitted speech is an attractive and popular technique in conventional speech coding. In contrast, neural speech codecs are typically trained end-to-end to a specific set of requirements and are often not easily adaptable. In particular, they are typically trained to operate at a single fixed sampling rate. With the Universal Bandwidth Extension Generative Adversarial Network (UBGAN), we propose a modular and lightweight GAN-based solution that increases the operational flexibility of a wide range of conventional and neural codecs. Our model operates in the subband domain and extends the bandwidth of WB signals from 8 kHz to 16 kHz, resulting in super-wideband (SWB) signals. We further introduce two variants, guided-UBGAN and blind-UBGAN, where the guided version transmits quantized learned representation as a side information at a very low bitrate additional to the bitrate of the codec, while blind-BWE operates without such side-information. Our subjective assessments demonstrate the advantage of UBGAN applied to WB codecs and highlight the generalization capacity of our proposed method across multiple codecs and bitrates.</p></details> |  |
| **[AceReason-Nemotron: Advancing Math and Code Reasoning through Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16400v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning, the training recipe for building high-performing reasoning models remains elusive. Key implementation details of frontier models, such as DeepSeek-R1, including data curation strategies and RL training recipe, are often omitted. Moreover, recent research indicates distillation remains more effective than RL for smaller models. In this work, we demonstrate that large-scale RL can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of strong, small- and mid-sized models, achieving results that surpass those of state-of-the-art distillation-based models. We systematically study the RL training process through extensive ablations and propose a simple yet effective approach: first training on math-only prompts, then on code-only prompts. Notably, we find that math-only RL not only significantly enhances the performance of strong distilled models on math benchmarks (e.g., +14.6% / +17.2% on AIME 2025 for the 7B / 14B models), but also code reasoning tasks (e.g., +6.8% / +5.8% on LiveCodeBench for the 7B / 14B models). In addition, extended code-only RL iterations further improve performance on code benchmarks with minimal or no degradation in math results. We develop a robust data curation pipeline to collect challenging prompts with high-quality, verifiable answers and test cases to enable verification-based RL across both domains. Finally, we identify key experimental insights, including curriculum learning with progressively increasing response lengths and the stabilizing effect of on-policy parameter updates. We find that RL not only elicits the foundational reasoning capabilities acquired during pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (e.g., distillation), but also pushes the limits of the model's reasoning ability, enabling it to solve problems that were previously unsolvable.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We release the model at: https://huggingface.co/nvidia/AceReason-Nemotron-14B</p></details> |
| **[Half-Marker Codes for Deletion Channels with Applications in DNA Storage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16344v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DNA storage systems face significant challenges, including insertion, deletion, and substitution (IDS) errors. Therefore, designing effective synchronization codes, i.e., codes capable of correcting IDS errors, is essential for DNA storage systems. Marker codes are a favorable choice for this purpose. In this paper, we extend the notion of marker codes by making the following key observation. Since each DNA base is equivalent to a 2-bit storage unit, one bit can be reserved for synchronization, while the other is dedicated to data transmission. Using this observation, we propose a new class of marker codes, which we refer to as half-marker codes. We demonstrate that this extension has the potential to significantly increase the mutual information between the input symbols and the soft outputs of an IDS channel modeling a DNA storage system. Specifically, through examples, we show that when concatenated with an outer error-correcting code, half-marker codes outperform standard marker codes and significantly reduce the end-to-end bit error rate of the system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Code Review Workflows with LLM Assistance: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16339v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code reviews are a critical yet time-consuming aspect of modern software development, increasingly challenged by growing system complexity and the demand for faster delivery. This paper presents a study conducted at WirelessCar Sweden AB, combining an exploratory field study of current code review practices with a field experiment involving two variations of an LLM-assisted code review tool. The field study identifies key challenges in traditional code reviews, including frequent context switching, insufficient contextual information, and highlights both opportunities (e.g., automatic summarization of complex pull requests) and concerns (e.g., false positives and trust issues) in using LLMs. In the field experiment, we developed two prototype variations: one offering LLM-generated reviews upfront and the other enabling on-demand interaction. Both utilize a semantic search pipeline based on retrieval-augmented generation to assemble relevant contextual information for the review, thereby tackling the uncovered challenges. Developers evaluated both variations in real-world settings: AI-led reviews are overall more preferred, while still being conditional on the reviewers' familiarity with the code base, as well as on the severity of the pull request.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeMind: Evaluating Large Language Models for Code Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.09664v5)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely used to automate programming tasks. Their capabilities have been evaluated by assessing the quality of generated code through tests or proofs. The extent to which they can reason about code is a critical question revealing important insights about their true capabilities. This paper introduces CodeMind, a framework designed to gauge the code reasoning abilities of LLMs through the following explicit and implicit code reasoning tasks: Independent Execution Reasoning (IER), Specification Reasoning (SR) and Dynamic Semantics Reasoning (DSR). The first evaluates the abilities of LLMs to simulate the execution of given inputs to a code and predict the output (IER). The second assesses the abilities of LLMs to incorporate the simulation of test data in the specification into code generation (SR). Finally, CodeMind evaluates LLMs' abilities to understand overall code semantics only given a specific input/output (DSR). Our extensive evaluation of ten LLMs across four widely used benchmarks using CodeMind shows that LLMs, depending on their size and training strategy, can reason about some dynamic aspects of code. However, their performance drops for code with higher complexity, non-trivial logical and arithmetic operators, non-primitive types, and API calls. We show that these reasoning tasks evaluate LLMs differently, and a comprehensive evaluation of code reasoning requires them all. Finally, we show that the performance of LLMs in bug repair is not correlated with any of the code reasoning tasks, and except for advanced frontier models, other LLMs do not incorporate code reasoning when performing bug repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[To Code or not to Code? Adaptive Tool Integration for Math Language Models via Expectation-Maximization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00691v3)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in mathematical problem-solving with language models (LMs) integrate chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning and code execution to harness their complementary strengths. However, existing hybrid frameworks exhibit a critical limitation: they depend on externally dictated instructions or rigid code-integration templates, lacking metacognitive awareness -- the capacity to dynamically evaluate intrinsic capabilities and autonomously determine when and how to integrate tools. This rigidity motivates our study of autonomous code integration, enabling models to adapt tool-usage strategies as their reasoning abilities evolve during training. While reinforcement learning (RL) shows promise for boosting LLM reasoning at scale (e.g., DeepSeek-R1), we demonstrate its inefficiency in learning autonomous code integration due to inadequate exploration of the vast combinatorial space of CoT-code interleaving patterns. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Expectation-Maximization (EM) framework that synergizes structured exploration (E-step) with off-policy RL optimization (M-step), creating a self-reinforcing cycle between metacognitive tool-use decisions and evolving capabilities. Experiments reveal our method achieves superior results through improved exploration. Notably, our 7B model improves over 11% on MATH500 and 9.4% on AIME without o1-like CoT.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2025 |
| **[Don't Judge Code by Its Cover: Exploring Biases in LLM Judges for Code Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16222v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing use of large language models(LLMs) as evaluators, their application has expanded to code evaluation tasks, where they assess the correctness of generated code without relying on reference implementations. While this offers scalability and flexibility, it also raises a critical, unresolved question: Can LLM judges fairly and robustly evaluate semantically equivalent code with superficial variations? Functionally correct code often exhibits variations-such as differences in variable names, comments, or formatting-that should not influence its correctness. Yet, whether LLM judges can reliably handle these variations remains unclear. We present the first comprehensive study of this issue, defining six types of potential bias in code evaluation and revealing their systematic impact on LLM judges. Across five programming languages and multiple LLMs, we empirically demonstrate that all tested LLM judges are susceptible to both positive and negative biases, resulting in inflated or unfairly low scores. Moreover, we observe that LLM judges remain vulnerable to these biases even when prompted to generate test cases before scoring, highlighting the need for more robust code evaluation methods.</p></details> | 26 pages |
| **[Generative Latent Coding for Ultra-Low Bitrate Image and Video Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16177v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most existing approaches for image and video compression perform transform coding in the pixel space to reduce redundancy. However, due to the misalignment between the pixel-space distortion and human perception, such schemes often face the difficulties in achieving both high-realism and high-fidelity at ultra-low bitrate. To solve this problem, we propose \textbf{G}enerative \textbf{L}atent \textbf{C}oding (\textbf{GLC}) models for image and video compression, termed GLC-image and GLC-Video. The transform coding of GLC is conducted in the latent space of a generative vector-quantized variational auto-encoder (VQ-VAE). Compared to the pixel-space, such a latent space offers greater sparsity, richer semantics and better alignment with human perception, and show its advantages in achieving high-realism and high-fidelity compression. To further enhance performance, we improve the hyper prior by introducing a spatial categorical hyper module in GLC-image and a spatio-temporal categorical hyper module in GLC-video. Additionally, the code-prediction-based loss function is proposed to enhance the semantic consistency. Experiments demonstrate that our scheme shows high visual quality at ultra-low bitrate for both image and video compression. For image compression, GLC-image achieves an impressive bitrate of less than $0.04$ bpp, achieving the same FID as previous SOTA model MS-ILLM while using $45\%$ fewer bitrate on the CLIC 2020 test set. For video compression, GLC-video achieves 65.3\% bitrate saving over PLVC in terms of DISTS.</p></details> |  |
| **[LEANCODE: Understanding Models Better for Code Simplification of Pre-trained Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14759v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models for code often entail significant computational complexity, which grows significantly with the length of the input code sequence. We propose LeanCode for code simplification to reduce training and prediction time, leveraging code contexts in utilizing attention scores to represent the tokens' importance. We advocate for the selective removal of tokens based on the average context-aware attention scores rather than average scores across all inputs. LeanCode uses the attention scores of `CLS' tokens within the encoder for classification tasks, such as code search. It also employs the encoder-decoder attention scores to determine token significance for sequence-to-sequence tasks like code summarization. Our evaluation shows LeanCode's superiority over the SOTAs DietCode and Slimcode, with improvements of 60% and 16% for code search, and 29% and 27% for code summarization, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |
| **[Code Readability in the Age of Large Language Models: An Industrial Case Study from Atlassian](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11264v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software engineers spend a significant amount of time reading code during the software development process. This trend is amplified by the emergence of large language models (LLMs) that automatically generate code. However, little is known about the readability of the LLM-generated code and whether it is still important from practitioners' perspectives in this new era. In this paper, we conduct a survey to explore the practitioners' perspectives on code readability in the age of LLMs and investigate the readability of our LLM-based software development agents framework, HULA, by comparing its generated code with human-written code in real-world scenarios. Overall, the findings underscore that (1) readability remains a critical aspect of software development; (2) the readability of our LLM-generated code is comparable to human-written code, fostering the establishment of appropriate trust and driving the broad adoption of our LLM-powered software development platform.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 7 figures, 8 tables, under review</p></details> |

| **[CodeSSM: Towards State Space Models for Code Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01475v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although transformers are widely used for various code-specific tasks, they have some significant limitations. In this paper, we investigate State Space Models (SSMs) as a potential alternative to transformers for code understanding tasks, such as code retrieval, classification, and clone detection. Previous research has already demonstrated that SSMs are more compute-efficient than transformers. In our work, we show that SSMs are also more sample-efficient and can effectively extrapolate to longer contexts (beyond the pretraining context) during fine-tuning. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that SSMs could serve as a viable alternative to transformers for code understanding tasks, while addressing some of the major limitations associated with transformers.</p></details> |  |
| **[DS-Bench: A Realistic Benchmark for Data Science Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15621v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce DS-bench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on complicated and realistic data science code generation tasks. DS-bench consists of 1,000 carefully constructed problems sourced from realistic problems from GitHub across ten widely used Python data science libraries. Compared to the current state-of-the-art benchmark DS-1000, DS-bench offers a more challenging and representative testbed, longer code solutions, more comprehensive data science libraries, clearer and better structured problem descriptions, and stronger test suites. To construct the DS-bench, we develop a robust pipeline that combines task scope selection, code construction, test case generation, and problem description synthesis. The process is paired with rigorous manual editing to ensure alignment and enhance evaluation reliability. Experimental result shows that DS-bench exhibits robust scaling behavior, where larger models systematically outperform smaller ones, validating its ability to distinguish model capabilities. The best LLM we test, GPT-4o, has a pass@1 of 0.202, indicating that LLMs still have a large room to improve for realistic data science code generation tasks. We believe DS-bench will serve as a rigorous and trustworthy foundation for advancing LLM-based data science programming.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Text-Rich Image Understanding via Code-Guided Synthetic Multimodal Data Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14846v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning about images with rich text, such as charts and documents, is a critical application of vision-language models (VLMs). However, VLMs often struggle in these domains due to the scarcity of diverse text-rich vision-language data. To address this challenge, we present CoSyn, a framework that leverages the coding capabilities of text-only large language models (LLMs) to automatically create synthetic text-rich multimodal data. Given input text describing a target domain (e.g., "nutrition fact labels"), CoSyn prompts an LLM to generate code (Python, HTML, LaTeX, etc.) for rendering synthetic images. With the underlying code as textual representations of the synthetic images, CoSyn can generate high-quality instruction-tuning data, again relying on a text-only LLM. Using CoSyn, we constructed a dataset comprising 400K images and 2.7M rows of vision-language instruction-tuning data. Comprehensive experiments on seven benchmarks demonstrate that models trained on our synthetic data achieve state-of-the-art performance among competitive open-source models, including Llama 3.2, and surpass proprietary models such as GPT-4V and Gemini 1.5 Flash. Furthermore, CoSyn can produce synthetic pointing data, enabling VLMs to ground information within input images, showcasing its potential for developing multimodal agents capable of acting in real-world environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in ACL 2025, project page: https://yueyang1996.github.io/cosyn/</p></details> |

| **[CodeI/O: Condensing Reasoning Patterns via Code Input-Output Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07316v4)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning is a fundamental capability of Large Language Models. While prior research predominantly focuses on enhancing narrow skills like math or code generation, improving performance on many other reasoning tasks remains challenging due to sparse and fragmented training data. To address this issue, we propose CodeI/O, a novel approach that systematically condenses diverse reasoning patterns inherently embedded in contextually-grounded codes, through transforming the original code into a code input-output prediction format. By training models to predict inputs/outputs given code and test cases entirely in natural language as Chain-of-Thought (CoT) rationales, we expose them to universal reasoning primitives -- like logic flow planning, state-space searching, decision tree traversal, and modular decomposition -- while decoupling structured reasoning from code-specific syntax and preserving procedural rigor. Experimental results demonstrate CodeI/O leads to consistent improvements across symbolic, scientific, logic, math & numerical, and commonsense reasoning tasks. By matching the existing ground-truth outputs or re-executing the code with predicted inputs, we can verify each prediction and further enhance the CoTs through multi-turn revision, resulting in CodeI/O++ and achieving higher performance. Our data and models are available at https://github.com/hkust-nlp/CodeIO.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[A Qualitative Investigation into LLM-Generated Multilingual Code Comments and Automatic Evaluation Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15469v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models are essential coding assistants, yet their training is predominantly English-centric. In this study, we evaluate the performance of code language models in non-English contexts, identifying challenges in their adoption and integration into multilingual workflows. We conduct an open-coding study to analyze errors in code comments generated by five state-of-the-art code models, CodeGemma, CodeLlama, CodeQwen1.5, GraniteCode, and StarCoder2 across five natural languages: Chinese, Dutch, English, Greek, and Polish. Our study yields a dataset of 12,500 labeled generations, which we publicly release. We then assess the reliability of standard metrics in capturing comment \textit{correctness} across languages and evaluate their trustworthiness as judgment criteria. Through our open-coding investigation, we identified a taxonomy of 26 distinct error categories in model-generated code comments. They highlight variations in language cohesion, informativeness, and syntax adherence across different natural languages. Our analysis shows that, while these models frequently produce partially correct comments, modern neural metrics fail to reliably differentiate meaningful completions from random noise. Notably, the significant score overlap between expert-rated correct and incorrect comments calls into question the effectiveness of these metrics in assessing generated comments.</p></details> | Accepted PROMISE '25 |
| **[NL-Debugging: Exploiting Natural Language as an Intermediate Representation for Code Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15356v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging is a critical aspect of LLM's coding ability. Early debugging efforts primarily focused on code-level analysis, which often falls short when addressing complex programming errors that require a deeper understanding of algorithmic logic. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have shifted attention toward leveraging natural language reasoning to enhance code-related tasks. However, two fundamental questions remain unanswered: What type of natural language format is most effective for debugging tasks? And what specific benefits does natural language reasoning bring to the debugging process? In this paper, we introduce NL-DEBUGGING, a novel framework that employs natural language as an intermediate representation to improve code debugging. By debugging at a natural language level, we demonstrate that NL-DEBUGGING outperforms traditional debugging methods and enables a broader modification space through direct refinement guided by execution feedback. Our findings highlight the potential of natural language reasoning to advance automated code debugging and address complex programming challenges.</p></details> |  |

A key approach is self-training, where LLMs are iteratively trained on self-generated correct code snippets. In this case, the self-generated codes are drawn from a conditional distribution, conditioned on a specific seed description. However, the seed description is not the only valid representation that aligns with its intended meaning. With all valid descriptions and codes forming a joint space, codes drawn from the conditional distribution would lead to an underrepresentation of the full description-code space. As such, we propose Gibbs Fine-Tuning (GiFT), a novel self-training method inspired by Gibbs sampling. GiFT allows self-generated data to be drawn from the marginal distribution of the joint space, thereby mitigating the biases inherent in conditional sampling. We provide a theoretical analysis demonstrating the potential benefits of fine-tuning LLMs with code derived from the marginal distribution. Furthermore, we propose a perplexity-based code selection method to mitigate the imbalanced long-tail distribution of the self-generated codes. Empirical evaluation of two LLMs across four datasets demonstrates that GiFT achieves superior performance, particularly on more challenging benchmarks.

However, its algorithms often become more complex or require additional hyperparameters because of the locality, making it challenging to identify desirable settings in which the algorithm progresses in a stable manner. To provide theoretical and quantitative insights, we introduce the maximal update parameterization ($\mu$P) in the infinite-width limit for two representative designs of local targets: predictive coding (PC) and target propagation (TP). We verified that $\mu$P enables hyperparameter transfer across models of different widths. Furthermore, our analysis revealed unique and intriguing properties of $\mu$P that are not present in conventional BP. By analyzing deep linear networks, we found that PC's gradients interpolate between first-order and Gauss-Newton-like gradients, depending on the parameterization. We demonstrate that, in specific standard settings, PC in the infinite-width limit behaves more similarly to the first-order gradient. For TP, even with the standard scaling of the last layer, which differs from classical $\mu$P, its local loss optimization favors the feature learning regime over the kernel regime.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[RAG or Fine-tuning? A Comparative Study on LCMs-based Code Completion in Industry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15179v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code completion, a crucial practice in industrial settings, helps developers improve programming efficiency by automatically suggesting code snippets during development. With the emergence of Large Code Models (LCMs), this field has witnessed significant advancements. Due to the natural differences between open-source and industrial codebases, such as coding patterns and unique internal dependencies, it is a common practice for developers to conduct domain adaptation when adopting LCMs in industry. There exist multiple adaptation approaches, among which retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and fine-tuning are the two most popular paradigms. However, no prior research has explored the trade-off of the two approaches in industrial scenarios. To mitigate the gap, we comprehensively compare the two paradigms including Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and Fine-tuning (FT), for industrial code completion in this paper. In collaboration with Tencent's WXG department, we collect over 160,000 internal C++ files as our codebase. We then compare the two types of adaptation approaches from three dimensions that are concerned by industrial practitioners, including effectiveness, efficiency, and parameter sensitivity, using six LCMs. Our findings reveal that RAG, when implemented with appropriate embedding models that map code snippets into dense vector representations, can achieve higher accuracy than fine-tuning alone. Specifically, BM25 presents superior retrieval effectiveness and efficiency among studied RAG methods. Moreover, RAG and fine-tuning are orthogonal and their combination leads to further improvement. We also observe that RAG demonstrates better scalability than FT, showing more sustained performance gains with larger scales of codebase.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in FSE 25 Industry Track</p></details> |

Each problem consists of (1) the task of generating a specification that matches a held-out ground-truth specification, and (2) the task of generating a Lean implementation that provably satisfies this specification. Unlike prior benchmarks, ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$ avoids test-case supervision, LLM-generated annotations, and specifications that leak implementation logic or allow vacuous solutions. All outputs are verified post-hoc using Lean's type checker to ensure machine-checkable correctness. We use ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$ to evaluate several few-shot and agentic approaches based on state-of-the-art language models. These methods all struggle to achieve full verification, establishing it as a challenging frontier benchmark for program synthesis and formal reasoning. Our benchmark can be found on GitHub(https://github.com/trishullab/clever) as well as HuggingFace(https://huggingface.co/datasets/amitayusht/clever).

Despite advancements through few-shot prompting and query expansion, existing methods remain limited in handling ambiguous and complex queries, thereby requiring manual intervention. To overcome these limitations, we propose VisPath: a Multi-Path Reasoning and Feedback-Driven Optimization Framework for Visualization Code Generation. VisPath handles underspecified queries through structured, multi-stage processing. It begins by reformulating the user input via Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which refers to the initial query while generating multiple extended queries in parallel, enabling the LLM to capture diverse interpretations of the user intent. These queries then generate candidate visualization scripts, which are executed to produce diverse images. By assessing the visual quality and correctness of each output, VisPath generates targeted feedback that is aggregated to synthesize an optimal final result. Extensive experiments on widely-used benchmarks including MatPlotBench and the Qwen-Agent Code Interpreter Benchmark show that VisPath outperforms state-of-the-art methods, offering a more reliable solution for AI-driven visualization code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 5 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

However, its manual memory management model frequently leads to memory safety issues. In response, a modern system programming language, Rust, has emerged as a memory-safe alternative. Moreover, automating the C-to-Rust translation empowered by the rapid advancements of the generative capabilities of LLMs is gaining growing interest for large volumes of legacy C code. Despite some success, existing LLM-based approaches have constrained the role of LLMs to static prompt-response behavior and have not explored their agentic problem-solving capability. Applying the LLM agentic capability for the C-to-Rust translation introduces distinct challenges, as this task differs from the traditional LLM agent applications, such as math or commonsense QA domains. First, the scarcity of parallel C-to-Rust datasets hinders the retrieval of suitable code translation exemplars for in-context learning. Second, unlike math or commonsense QA, the intermediate steps required for C-to-Rust are not well-defined. Third, it remains unclear how to organize and cascade these intermediate steps to construct a correct translation trajectory. To address these challenges in the C-to-Rust translation, we propose a novel intermediate step, the Virtual Fuzzing-based equivalence Test (VFT), and an agentic planning framework, the LLM-powered Agent for C-to-Rust code translation (LAC2R). The VFT guides LLMs to identify input arguments that induce divergent behaviors between an original C function and its Rust counterpart and to generate informative diagnoses to refine the unsafe Rust code. LAC2R uses the MCTS to systematically organize the LLM-induced intermediate steps for correct translation. We experimentally demonstrated that LAC2R effectively conducts C-to-Rust translation on large-scale, real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Current manual workflows remain highly time-consuming and demand extensive user expertise. While recent developments in AI-driven CAD generation show promise, existing models are limited by incomplete representations of CAD operations, inability to generalize to real-world images, and low output accuracy. This paper introduces CAD-Coder, an open-source Vision-Language Model (VLM) explicitly fine-tuned to generate editable CAD code (CadQuery Python) directly from visual input. Leveraging a novel dataset that we created--GenCAD-Code, consisting of over 163k CAD-model image and code pairs--CAD-Coder outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines such as GPT-4.5 and Qwen2.5-VL-72B, achieving a 100% valid syntax rate and the highest accuracy in 3D solid similarity. Notably, our VLM demonstrates some signs of generalizability, successfully generating CAD code from real-world images and executing CAD operations unseen during fine-tuning. The performance and adaptability of CAD-Coder highlights the potential of VLMs fine-tuned on code to streamline CAD workflows for engineers and designers.

We prove that layerwise PC performs block-coordinate descent on the MDL two-part code objective, thereby jointly minimizing empirical risk and model complexity. Using Hoeffding's inequality and a prefix-code prior, we derive a novel generalization bound of the form $R(\theta) \le \hat{R}(\theta) + \frac{L(\theta)}{N}$, capturing the tradeoff between fit and compression. We further prove that each PC sweep monotonically decreases the empirical two-part codelength, yielding tighter high-probability risk bounds than unconstrained gradient descent. Finally, we show that repeated PC updates converge to a block-coordinate stationary point, providing an approximate MDL-optimal solution. To our knowledge, this is the first result offering formal generalization and convergence guarantees for PC-trained deep models, positioning PC as a theoretically grounded and biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation.</p></details> | 24 pages, 2 figures |

While current code benchmarks and instruction data focus on difficulty and diversity, sensitivity is overlooked. We first introduce the CTF-Code benchmark, constructed using counterfactual perturbations, minimizing input changes while maximizing output changes. The evaluation shows that many LLMs have a more than 10\% performance drop compared to the original problems. To fully utilize sensitivity, CTF-Instruct, an incremental instruction fine-tuning framework, extends on existing data and uses a selection mechanism to meet the three dimensions of difficulty, diversity, and sensitivity. Experiments show that LLMs fine-tuned with CTF-Instruct data achieve over a 2\% improvement on CTF-Code, and more than a 10\% performance boost on LiveCodeBench, validating the feasibility of enhancing LLMs' sensitivity to improve performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code & Model is https://github.com/Luowaterbi/CTF-Instruct</p></details> |

Given a multivariate multiplicity code, in this paper, we compute its dimension using Gr\"obner basis tools, its dual in terms of indicator functions, and explicitly describe a parity-check matrix. In contrast with Reed--Muller, Reed--Solomon, univariate multiplicity, and other evaluation codes, the dual of a multivariate multiplicity code is not equivalent or isometric to a multiplicity code (i.e., this code family is not closed under duality). We use our explicit description to provide a lower bound on the minimum distance for the dual of a multiplicity code.</p></details> |  |

Our study systematically investigates the increased susceptibility of LLMs to produce unsafe outputs from code-mixed prompts compared to monolingual English prompts.

In addition, we explore cultural dimensions by distinguishing between universally unsafe and culturally-specific unsafe queries.

| **[Towards Mitigating API Hallucination in Code Generated by LLMs with Hierarchical Dependency Aware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05057v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are crucial in modern software development. Large Language Models (LLMs) assist in automated code generation but often struggle with API hallucination, including invoking non-existent APIs and misusing existing ones in practical development scenarios. Existing studies resort to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for mitigating the hallucination issue, but tend to fail since they generally ignore the structural dependencies in practical projects and do not indeed validate whether the generated APIs are available or not. To address these limitations, we propose MARIN, a framework for mitigating API hallucination in code generated by LLMs with hierarchical dependency aware. MARIN consists of two phases: Hierarchical Dependency Mining, which analyzes local and global dependencies of the current function, aiming to supplement comprehensive project context in LLMs input, and Dependency Constrained Decoding, which utilizes mined dependencies to adaptively constrain the generation process, aiming to ensure the generated APIs align with the projects specifications. To facilitate the evaluation of the degree of API hallucination, we introduce a new benchmark APIHulBench and two new metrics including Micro Hallucination Number (MiHN) and Macro Hallucination Rate (MaHR). Experiments on six state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that MARIN effectively reduces API hallucinations, achieving an average decrease of 67.52% in MiHN and 73.56% in MaHR compared to the RAG approach. Applied to Huaweis internal projects and two proprietary LLMs, MARIN achieves average decreases of 57.33% in MiHN and 59.41% in MaHR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by FSE 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |

However, despite their extensive knowledge and ability to produce high-quality code, LLMs often struggle with contextual accuracy, particularly in evolving codebases. Current code search and retrieval methods frequently lack robustness in both the quality and contextual relevance of retrieved results, leading to suboptimal code generation. This paper introduces a novel knowledge graph-based approach to improve code search and retrieval leading to better quality of code generation in the context of repository-level tasks. The proposed approach represents code repositories as graphs, capturing structural and relational information for enhanced context-aware code generation. Our framework employs a hybrid approach for code retrieval to improve contextual relevance, track inter-file modular dependencies, generate more robust code and ensure consistency with the existing codebase. We benchmark the proposed approach on the Evolutionary Code Benchmark (EvoCodeBench) dataset, a repository-level code generation benchmark, and demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baseline approach. These findings suggest that knowledge graph based code generation could advance robust, context-sensitive coding assistance tools.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |

However, verifying assembly code against a realistic machine model is a challenging task. Furthermore, certain security properties -- such as constant-time behavior -- require relational reasoning that goes beyond traditional correctness by linking multiple execution traces within a single specification. Yet, relational verification has been extensively explored at a higher level of abstraction. In this work, we introduce a Hoare-style logic that provides low-level, expressive relational verification. We demonstrate our approach on the s2n-bignum library, proving both constant-time discipline and equivalence between optimized and verification-friendly routines. Formalized in HOL Light, our results confirm the real-world applicability of relational verification in large assembly codebases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Denis...</summary><p>Denis Mazzucato and Abdalrhman Mohamed contributed equally to this work; Juneyoung Lee is the corresponding author: lebjuney@amazon.com; 29 pages, 3 Figures; accepted at the 37th International Conference on Computer Aided Verification (CAV) 2025</p></details> |

In previous work, we proposed lifting a CSS code by constructing covering spaces over its 2D simplicial complex representation, known as the Tanner cone-complex. This idea was inspired by the work of Freedman and Hastings, which associates CSS codes with handlebodies. In this paper, we show how the handlebody realization of a code can also be used to perform code lifting, and we provide a more detailed discussion of why this is essentially equivalent to the Tanner cone-complex approach. As an application, we classify lifts of hypergraph-product codes via their handlebody realization.</p></details> |  |

Analyzing Code Quality in Collaborative Student's Projects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14315v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates code quality education by analyzing how errors are introduced and corrected in group projects within an embedded systems course. We identify who introduces errors, who fixes them, and when these actions occur. Students learn code quality rules for C and embedded systems. We address three questions: RQ1: What is the impact of group formation on code quality? RQ2: How do students interact to fix code issues? RQ3: When are issues introduced and resolved? We analyzed data from eight individual labs and two group projects involving 34 students. The course provides continuous, automated feedback on code quality. Findings show that the most active contributors often introduce the most issues. Many issues are fixed late in the project. Individual labs tend to have fewer issues due to their structured nature. Most problems are fixed by the original author, while cross-student fixes take longer, especially in shared code. Critical issues are fixed quickly, but non-critical ones may be ignored, showing a focus on functionality over quality.</p></details> |  |

In the first, our code recovered about 74% of errors in less than 10 hours each, and in the second case, we give experimental evidence that 80% of the errors can be recovered in times corresponding to about 70 bits of operational security, with some instances being significantly lower.</p></details> |  |

Current methods on PCR mainly focus on the reviewer's perspective, including finding a capable reviewer, predicting comment quality, and recommending/generating review comments. However, it is not well studied that how to satisfy the review necessity requests posted by developers which can increase their visibility, which in turn acts as a prerequisite for better review responses. To this end, we propose Knowledge-guided Prompt learning for Public Code Review (KP-PCR) to achieve developer-based code review request quality assurance (i.e., predicting request necessity and recommending tags subtask). Specifically, we reformulate the two subtasks via 1) text prompt tuning which converts both of them into a Masked Language Model (MLM) by constructing prompt templates using hard prompt; and 2) knowledge and code prefix tuning which introduces knowledge guidance from fine-tuned large language models by soft prompt, and uses program dependence graph to characterize code snippets. Finally, both of the request necessity prediction and tag recommendation subtasks output predicted results through an answer engineering module. In addition, we further analysis the time complexity of our KP-PCR that has lightweight prefix based the operation of introducing knowledge guidance. Experimental results on the PCR dataset for the period 2011-2023 demonstrate that our KP-PCR outperforms baselines by 2.3%-8.4% in the request necessity prediction and by 1.4%-6.9% in the tag recommendation.

These models are being evaluated through audits, alignment studies and red-teaming efforts to expose model vulnerabilities towards generating harmful, biased and unfair content. Existing red-teaming efforts have previously focused on the English language, using fixed template-based attacks; thus, models continue to be susceptible to multilingual jailbreaking strategies, especially in the multimodal context. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages code-mixing and phonetic perturbations to jailbreak LLMs for both text and image generation tasks. We also introduce two new jailbreak strategies that show higher effectiveness than baseline strategies. Our work presents a method to effectively bypass safety filters in LLMs while maintaining interpretability by applying phonetic misspellings to sensitive words in code-mixed prompts. Our novel prompts achieve a 99% Attack Success Rate for text generation and 78% for image generation, with Attack Relevance Rate of 100% for text generation and 95% for image generation when using the phonetically perturbed code-mixed prompts. Our interpretability experiments reveal that phonetic perturbations impact word tokenization, leading to jailbreak success. Our study motivates increasing the focus towards more generalizable safety alignment for multilingual multimodal models, especially in real-world settings wherein prompts can have misspelt words.</p></details> |  |
| **[Capturing the Effects of Quantization on Trojans in Code LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14200v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models of code exhibit high capability in performing diverse software engineering tasks, such as code translation, defect detection, text-to-code generation, and code summarization. While their ability to enhance developer productivity has spurred widespread use, these models have also seen substantial growth in size, often reaching billions of parameters. This scale demands efficient memory resource usage, prompting practitioners to use optimization techniques such as model quantization. Quantization uses smaller bit representations for the model parameters, reducing the precision of the weights. In this work, we investigate the impact of quantization on the risk of data poisoning attacks on these models, specifically examining whether it mitigates or exacerbates such vulnerabilities. We focus on two large language models, Meta's Llama-2-7b and CodeLlama-7b, applied to an SQL code generation task. Additionally, we introduce a new metric for measuring trojan signals in compromised models. We find that quantization has differing effects on code-generating LLMs: while reducing precision does not significantly alter Llama-2's behavior, it boosts performance and reduces attack success rates in CodeLlama, particularly at 4-bit precision.</p></details> |  |

However, this theory remains untested, limiting its practical and theoretical significance. Objective: This study aims to (1) formalize the theory of code review as a communication network explicit and (2) empirically test its validity by quantifying how widely and how quickly information can spread in code review. Method: We replicate an in-silico experiment simulating information diffusion -- the spread of information among participants -- under best-case conditions across three open-source (Android, Visual Studio Code, React) and three closed-source code review systems (Microsoft, Spotify, Trivago) each modeled as communication network. By measuring the number of reachable participants and the minimal topological and temporal distances, we quantify how widely and how quickly information can spread through code review. Results: We demonstrate that code review can enable both wide and fast information diffusion, even at a large scale. However, this capacity varies: open-source code review spreads information faster, while closed-source review reaches more participants. Conclusion: Our findings reinforce and refine the theory, highlighting implications for measuring collaboration, generalizing open-source studies, and the role of AI in shaping future code review.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2306.08980</p></details> |

These tools now require large and complex contexts, automatically sourced from various origins$\unicode{x2014}$across files, projects, and contributors$\unicode{x2014}$forming part of the prompt fed to underlying LLMs. This automatic context-gathering introduces new vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to subtly poison input to compromise the assistant's outputs, potentially generating vulnerable code or introducing critical errors. We propose a novel attack, Cross-Origin Context Poisoning (XOXO), that is challenging to detect as it relies on adversarial code modifications that are semantically equivalent. Traditional program analysis techniques struggle to identify these perturbations since the semantics of the code remains correct, making it appear legitimate. This allows attackers to manipulate coding assistants into producing incorrect outputs, while shifting the blame to the victim developer. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic, black-box attack algorithm GCGS that systematically searches the transformation space using a Cayley Graph, achieving a 75.72% attack success rate on average across five tasks and eleven models, including GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 used by popular AI coding assistants. Furthermore, defenses like adversarial fine-tuning are ineffective against our attack, underscoring the need for new security measures in LLM-powered coding tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sense and Sensitivity: Examining the Influence of Semantic Recall on Long Context Code Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13353v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although modern Large Language Models (LLMs) support extremely large contexts, their effectiveness in utilizing long context for code reasoning remains unclear. This paper investigates LLM reasoning ability over code snippets within large repositories and how it relates to their recall ability. Specifically, we differentiate between lexical code recall (verbatim retrieval) and semantic code recall (remembering what the code does). To measure semantic recall, we propose SemTrace, a code reasoning technique where the impact of specific statements on output is attributable and unpredictable. We also present a method to quantify semantic recall sensitivity in existing benchmarks. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a significant drop in code reasoning accuracy as a code snippet approaches the middle of the input context, particularly with techniques requiring high semantic recall like SemTrace. Moreover, we find that lexical recall varies by granularity, with models excelling at function retrieval but struggling with line-by-line recall. Notably, a disconnect exists between lexical and semantic recall, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Finally, our findings indicate that current code reasoning benchmarks may exhibit low semantic recall sensitivity, potentially underestimating LLM challenges in leveraging in-context information.</p></details> |  |

To address this issue, we leverage a promising resource: game code, which naturally contains logical structures and state transition processes. Therefore, we propose Code2Logic, a novel game-code-driven approach for multimodal reasoning data synthesis. Our approach leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt game code, enabling automatic acquisition of reasoning processes and results through code execution. Using the Code2Logic approach, we developed the GameQA dataset to train and evaluate VLMs. GameQA is cost-effective and scalable to produce, challenging for state-of-the-art models, and diverse with 30 games and 158 tasks. Surprisingly, despite training solely on game data, VLMs demonstrated out of domain generalization, specifically Qwen2.5-VL-7B improving performance by 2.33\% across 7 diverse vision-language benchmarks. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/tongjingqi/Code2Logic.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 19 figures, submitted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Matryoshka: Revisiting Sparse Coding for Adaptive Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01776v5)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many large-scale systems rely on high-quality deep representations (embeddings) to facilitate tasks like retrieval, search, and generative modeling. Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) recently emerged as a solution for adaptive embedding lengths, but it requires full model retraining and suffers from noticeable performance degradations at short lengths. In this paper, we show that sparse coding offers a compelling alternative for achieving adaptive representation with minimal overhead and higher fidelity. We propose Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR), a method that sparsifies pre-trained embeddings into a high-dimensional but selectively activated feature space. By leveraging lightweight autoencoding and task-aware contrastive objectives, CSR preserves semantic quality while allowing flexible, cost-effective inference at different sparsity levels. Extensive experiments on image, text, and multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that CSR consistently outperforms MRL in terms of both accuracy and retrieval speed-often by large margins-while also cutting training time to a fraction of that required by MRL. Our results establish sparse coding as a powerful paradigm for adaptive representation learning in real-world applications where efficiency and fidelity are both paramount.

| **[OSS-Bench: Benchmark Generator for Coding LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12331v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In light of the rapid adoption of AI coding assistants, LLM-assisted development has become increasingly prevalent, creating an urgent need for robust evaluation of generated code quality. Existing benchmarks often require extensive manual effort to create static datasets, rely on indirect or insufficiently challenging tasks, depend on non-scalable ground truth, or neglect critical low-level security evaluations, particularly memory-safety issues. In this work, we introduce OSS-Bench, a benchmark generator that automatically constructs large-scale, live evaluation tasks from real-world open-source software. OSS-Bench replaces functions with LLM-generated code and evaluates them using three natural metrics: compilability, functional correctness, and memory safety, leveraging robust signals like compilation failures, test-suite violations, and sanitizer alerts as ground truth. In our evaluation, the benchmark, instantiated as OSS-Bench(php) and OSS-Bench(sql), profiles 17 diverse LLMs, revealing insights such as intra-family behavioral patterns and inconsistencies between model size and performance. Our results demonstrate that OSS-Bench mitigates overfitting by leveraging the evolving complexity of OSS and highlights LLMs' limited understanding of low-level code security via extended fuzzing experiments. Overall, OSS-Bench offers a practical and scalable framework for benchmarking the real-world coding capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[MigrationBench: Repository-Level Code Migration Benchmark from Java 8](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09569v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of powerful large language models (LLMs) in recent years, a wide range of software engineering tasks can now be addressed using LLMs, significantly enhancing productivity and scalability. Numerous benchmark datasets have been developed to evaluate the coding capabilities of these models, while they primarily focus on code generation and issue-resolution tasks. In contrast, we introduce a new coding benchmark MigrationBench with a distinct focus: code migration. MigrationBench aims to serve as a comprehensive benchmark for migration from Java $8$ to the latest long-term support (LTS) versions (Java $17$, $21$), including a full dataset and its subset selected with $5,102$ and $300$ repositories respectively. Selected is a representative subset curated for complexity and difficulty, offering a versatile resource to support research in the field of code migration. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation framework to facilitate rigorous and standardized assessment of LLMs on this challenging task. We further propose SD-Feedback and demonstrate that LLMs can effectively tackle repository-level code migration to Java $17$. For the selected subset with Claude-3.5-Sonnet-v2, SD-Feedback achieves $62.33\%$ and $27.33\%$ success rate (pass@1) for minimal and maximal migration respectively. The benchmark dataset and source code are available at: https://huggingface.co/collections/AmazonScience/migrationbench-68125452fc21a4564b92b6c3 and https://github.com/amazon-science/MigrationBench respectively.</p></details> |  |

A case study of LLM-driven configuration code generation for automotive simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13263v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are taking many industries by storm. They possess impressive reasoning capabilities and are capable of handling complex problems, as shown by their steadily improving scores on coding and mathematical benchmarks. However, are the models currently available truly capable of addressing real-world challenges, such as those found in the automotive industry? How well can they understand high-level, abstract instructions? Can they translate these instructions directly into functional code, or do they still need help and supervision? In this work, we put one of the current state-of-the-art models to the test. We evaluate its performance in the task of translating abstract requirements, extracted from automotive standards and documents, into configuration code for CARLA simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Natural Language Planning via Coding and Inference Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13252v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-life textual planning tasks such as meeting scheduling have posed much challenge to LLMs especially when the complexity is high. While previous work primarily studied auto-regressive generation of plans with closed-source models, we systematically evaluate both closed- and open-source models, including those that scales output length with complexity during inference, in generating programs, which are executed to output the plan. We consider not only standard Python code, but also the code to a constraint satisfaction problem solver. Despite the algorithmic nature of the task, we show that programming often but not always outperforms planning. Our detailed error analysis also indicates a lack of robustness and efficiency in the generated code that hinders generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[$μ$PC: Scaling Predictive Coding to 100+ Layer Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13124v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The biological implausibility of backpropagation (BP) has motivated many alternative, brain-inspired algorithms that attempt to rely only on local information, such as predictive coding (PC) and equilibrium propagation. However, these algorithms have notoriously struggled to train very deep networks, preventing them from competing with BP in large-scale settings. Indeed, scaling PC networks (PCNs) has recently been posed as a challenge for the community (Pinchetti et al., 2024). Here, we show that 100+ layer PCNs can be trained reliably using a Depth-$\mu$P parameterisation (Yang et al., 2023; Bordelon et al., 2023) which we call "$\mu$PC". Through an extensive analysis of the scaling behaviour of PCNs, we reveal several pathologies that make standard PCNs difficult to train at large depths. We then show that, despite addressing only some of these instabilities, $\mu$PC allows stable training of very deep (up to 128-layer) residual networks on simple classification tasks with competitive performance and little tuning compared to current benchmarks. Moreover, $\mu$PC enables zero-shot transfer of both weight and activity learning rates across widths and depths. Our results have implications for other local algorithms and could be extended to convolutional and transformer architectures. Code for $\mu$PC is made available as part of a JAX library for PCNs at https://github.com/thebuckleylab/jpc (Innocenti et al., 2024).</p></details> | 34 pages, 41 figures |

However, in practical applications, there remains a gap between current commonly used code completion evaluation metrics and users' actual perception. To address this issue, we propose two evaluation metrics for code completion tasks--LCP and ROUGE-LCP, from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Furthermore, to tackle the lack of effective structural semantic modeling and cross-module dependency information in LLMs for repository-level code completion scenarios, we propose a data processing method based on a Structure-Preserving and Semantically-Reordered Code Graph (SPSR-Graph). Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed evaluation metrics in terms of user perception consistency, as well as the effectiveness of the data processing method in enhancing model performance.</p></details> | 14 pages,8 figures |

To address this gap, we introduce EffiBench-X, the first multi-language benchmark designed to measure the efficiency of LLM-generated code. EffiBench-X supports Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, and Golang. It comprises competitive programming tasks with human-expert solutions as efficiency baselines. Evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on EffiBench-X reveals that while models generate functionally correct code, they consistently underperform human experts in efficiency. Even the most efficient LLM-generated solutions (Qwen3-32B) achieve only around \textbf{62\%} of human efficiency on average, with significant language-specific variations. LLMs show better efficiency in Python, Ruby, and JavaScript than in Java, C++, and Golang. For instance, DeepSeek-R1's Python code is significantly more efficient than its Java code. These results highlight the critical need for research into LLM optimization techniques to improve code efficiency across diverse languages. The dataset and evaluation infrastructure are submitted and available at https://github.com/EffiBench/EffiBench-X.git and https://huggingface.co/datasets/EffiBench/effibench-x.</p></details> | Under Review |

In this paper, we first give a general method to transform a minimal code satisfying the Ashikhmin-Barg condition to a minimal code violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition. Then we give a construction of a minimal code satisfying the Ashikhmin-Barg condition from an arbitrary projective linear code. Hence an arbitrary projective linear code can be transformed to a minimal codes violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition. Then we give infinite many families of minimal codes violating the Ashikhamin-Barg condition. Weight distributions of constructed minimal codes violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition in this paper are determined. Many minimal linear codes violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition with their minimum weights close to the optimal or the best known minimum weights of linear codes are constructed in this paper. Moreover, many infinite families of self-orthogonal binary minimal codes violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition are also given.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, minor error corrected</p></details> |

However, there remains a lack of standardized tools for automatic evaluation in this domain. To address this gap, we propose AutoGEEval, the first multimodal, unit-level automated evaluation framework for geospatial code generation tasks on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform powered by large language models (LLMs). Built upon the GEE Python API, AutoGEEval establishes a benchmark suite (AutoGEEval-Bench) comprising 1325 test cases that span 26 GEE data types. The framework integrates both question generation and answer verification components to enable an end-to-end automated evaluation pipeline-from function invocation to execution validation. AutoGEEval supports multidimensional quantitative analysis of model outputs in terms of accuracy, resource consumption, execution efficiency, and error types. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art LLMs-including general-purpose, reasoning-augmented, code-centric, and geoscience-specialized models-revealing their performance characteristics and potential optimization pathways in GEE code generation. This work provides a unified protocol and foundational resource for the development and assessment of geospatial code generation models, advancing the frontier of automated natural language to domain-specific code translation.</p></details> |  |

CS-Sum is the first benchmark for CS dialogue summarization across Mandarin-English (EN-ZH), Tamil-English (EN-TA), and Malay-English (EN-MS), with 900-1300 human-annotated dialogues per language pair. Evaluating ten LLMs, including open and closed-source models, we analyze performance across few-shot, translate-summarize, and fine-tuning (LoRA, QLoRA on synthetic data) approaches. Our findings show that though the scores on automated metrics are high, LLMs make subtle mistakes that alter the complete meaning of the dialogue. To this end, we introduce 3 most common type of errors that LLMs make when handling CS input. Error rates vary across CS pairs and LLMs, with some LLMs showing more frequent errors on certain language pairs, underscoring the need for specialized training on code-switched data.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures and 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Selective Code Generation for Functional Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13553v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) show human-level performance and their specialized descendants, code generation models, play core roles in solving complex tasks, including mathematical reasoning and software development. On the downside, the hallucination of LLMs mainly hinders their applicability to systems requiring higher safety standards, thus drawing the attention of the AI community. However, the hallucination of code generation models is rarely considered. One critical bottleneck in considering code hallucination is the intricate property of code to identify whether generated code has the intended functionality due to its un-natural form, different to natural languages. Handful of unit tests have been considered to address this issue, but scaling-up its size is extremely expensive. We address this core bottleneck by automatically generating unit tests using dynamic code analysis tools, which leverages the \emph{executable nature} of code. Given generated unit tests from true code for measuring functional correctness of generated code, we propose to learn a \emph{selective code generator}, which abstains from answering for unsure generation, to control the rate of code hallucination among non-abstaining answers in terms of a false discovery rate. This learning algorithm provides a controllability guarantee, providing trustworthiness of code generation. Finally, we propose to use generated unit tests in evaluation as well as in learning for precise code evaluation, calling this evaluation paradigm \emph{FuzzEval}. We demonstrate the efficacy of our selective code generator over open and closed code generators, showing clear benefit of leveraging generated unit tests along with the controllability of code hallucination and reasonable selection efficiency via our selective code generator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards A Generalist Code Embedding Model Based On Massive Data Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12697v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code embedding models attract increasing attention due to the widespread popularity of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in software development. These models are expected to capture the rich semantic relationships inherent to code, which differ significantly from those found in text. However, existing models remain severely limited due to the scarcity of high-quality training data. In this work, we introduce \textbf{CodeR} (\underline{Code} \underline{R}etrieval), a state-of-the-art embedding model for general-purpose code retrieval. The superior performance of CodeR is built upon CodeR-Pile, a large-scale synthetic dataset constructed under the DRU (Diversity, Reliability, Usability) principle via a novel data synthesis pipeline. To optimize training effectiveness, we propose Annealing, a curriculum learning strategy that enables effective knowledge transfer across heterogeneous sources of data. We evaluate CodeR based on 16 diverse code retrieval tasks, where it significantly outperforms existing baselines and exhibits strong out-of-domain generalization performance. We have publicly released our code and the well-trained model to facilitate further research in this critical area. https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding/tree/master/research/BGE_Coder.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose CMLFormer, an enhanced multi-layer dual-decoder Transformer with a shared encoder and synchronized decoder cross-attention, designed to model the linguistic and semantic dynamics of code-mixed text. CMLFormer is pre-trained on an augmented Hinglish corpus with switching point and translation annotations with multiple new objectives specifically aimed at capturing switching behavior, cross-lingual structure, and code-mixing complexity. Our experiments show that CMLFormer improves F1 score, precision, and accuracy over other approaches on the HASOC-2021 benchmark under select pre-training setups. Attention analyses further show that it can identify and attend to switching points, validating its sensitivity to code-mixed structure. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of CMLFormer's architecture and multi-task pre-training strategy for modeling code-mixed languages.</p></details> |  |

In the meantime, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding scientific documents and generating high-quality code. Inspired by this, we introduce PaperCoder, a multi-agent LLM framework that transforms machine learning papers into functional code repositories. PaperCoder operates in three stages: planning, where it constructs a high-level roadmap, designs the system architecture with diagrams, identifies file dependencies, and generates configuration files; analysis, which focuses on interpreting implementation-specific details; and generation, where modular, dependency-aware code is produced. Moreover, each phase is instantiated through a set of specialized agents designed to collaborate effectively across the pipeline. We then evaluate PaperCoder on generating code implementations from machine learning papers based on both model-based and human evaluations, particularly from the authors of those papers, with author-released repositories as ground truth if available. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PaperCoder in creating high-quality, faithful implementations. Furthermore, it consistently shows strengths in the recently released PaperBench benchmark, surpassing strong baselines by substantial margins.

Despite the growing body of research focused on the security of CodeLMs, a comprehensive survey in this area remains absent. To address this gap, we systematically review 67 relevant papers, organizing them based on attack and defense strategies. Furthermore, we provide an overview of commonly used language models, datasets, and evaluation metrics, and highlight open-source tools and promising directions for future research in securing CodeLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |

Watermarking is a promising approach to distinguish machine-generated text from human text, embedding statistical signals in the output that are ideally undetectable to humans. We propose a watermarking framework that encodes such signals through an error correcting code. Our method, termed robust binary code (RBC) watermark, introduces no noticeable degradation in quality. We evaluate our watermark on base and instruction fine-tuned models and find our watermark is robust to edits, deletions, and translations. We provide an information-theoretic perspective on watermarking, a powerful statistical test for detection and for generating $p$-values, and theoretical guarantees. Our empirical findings suggest our watermark is fast, powerful, and robust, comparing favorably to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

Code LLMs are now household names for their abilities to do some programming tasks that have heretofore required people. The process that people follow to do programming tasks has long been understood to require static analysis. For example, human programmers navigate the call graph of large programs to comprehend the different parts of those programs. Education in programming includes static analysis under the assumption that better static analysis skills beget better programming. Yet while popular culture is replete with anthropomorphic references such as LLM "reasoning", in fact code LLMs could exhibit a wholly alien thought process to humans. This paper studies the specific question of static analysis by code LLMs. We use three different static analysis tasks (callgraph generation, AST generation, and dataflow generation) and three different code intelligence tasks (code generation, summarization, and translation) with two different open-source models (Gemini and GPT-4o) and closed-source models (CodeLlaMA and Jam) as our experiments. We found that LLMs show poor performance on static analysis tasks and that pretraining on the static analysis tasks does not generalize to better performance on the code intelligence tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 2 figures, Preprint in review</p></details> |

LLMs' capabilities to autonomously find and fix runtime logical errors in complex data science code remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce DSDBench: the Data Science Debugging Benchmark, the first benchmark for systematic evaluation of LLMs on multi-hop error tracing and multi-bug detection in data science code debugging. DSDBench adapts datasets from existing data science task benchmarks, such as DABench and MatPlotBench, featuring realistic data science debugging tasks with automatically synthesized multi-hop, multi-bug code snippets. DSDBench includes 1,117 annotated samples with 741 cause-effect error pairs and runtime error messages. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on DSDBench show significant performance gaps, highlighting challenges in debugging logical runtime errors in data science code. DSDBench offers a crucial resource to evaluate and improve LLMs' debugging and reasoning capabilities, enabling more reliable AI-assisted data science in the future.

Let $q$ be a prime power, and $n$ be a positive integer coprime to $q$. In this paper we determine explicitly the representatives and the sizes of all $q$-cyclotomic cosets modulo $n$ in the general settings. We introduce the definition of $2$-adic cyclotomic system, which is a profinite space consists of certain compatible sequences of cyclotomic cosets. A precise characterization of the structure of the $2$-adic cyclotomic system is given, which reveals the general formula for representatives of cyclotomic cosets. With the representatives and the sizes of $q$-cyclotomic cosets modulo $n$, we improve the formulas for the factorizations of $X^{n}-1$ and of $\Phi_{n}(X)$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ given in \cite{Graner}. As a consequence, we classify the cyclic codes over finite fields via giving their generator polynomials. Moreover, the self-dual cyclic codes are determined and enumerated.</p></details> | 28 pages |

Current research is hindered by redundant generation results and a tendency to overfit local patterns in the short term. Although existing studies attempt to alleviate the issue by adopting a multi-token prediction strategy, there remains limited focus on choosing the appropriate processing length for generations. By analyzing the attention between tokens during the generation process of LLMs, it can be observed that the high spikes of the attention scores typically appear at the end of lines. This insight suggests that it is reasonable to treat each line of code as a fundamental processing unit and generate them sequentially. Inspired by this, we propose the \textbf{LSR-MCTS} algorithm, which leverages MCTS to determine the code line-by-line and select the optimal path. Further, we integrate a self-refine mechanism at each node to enhance diversity and generate higher-quality programs through error correction. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analyses on three public coding benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art performance approaches.</p></details> |  |

We formalize this iterative, multi-turn paradigm as codeflow and introduce CodeFlowBench, the first benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' ability to perform codeflow, namely implementing new functionality by reusing existing functions over multiple turns. CodeFlowBench comprises 5,258 problems from Codeforces and is continuously updated via an automated pipeline, which decomposes each problem into subproblems with unit tests based on dependency tree analysis and dataflow analysis. We further propose a novel evaluation framework featured dual assessment protocol and structural metrics derived from dependency trees. Extensive experiments on 16 popular LLMs reveal significant performance degradation in multi-turn scenarios. For instance, o1-mini retains only 20.8% Pass@1 in multi-turn scenario versus 37.8% in single-turn scenario. More fine-grained analysis illustrates that model performance inversely correlates with dependency complexity. These findings not only highlight the critical challenges for supporting real-world workflows, but also establish CodeFlowBench as an essential tool for advancing code generation research.</p></details> |  |

However, these systems often overlook a critical dimension in real-world software development: \textit{maintainability}. To handle dynamic requirements with minimal rework, we propose \textbf{MaintainCoder} as a pioneering solution. It integrates the Waterfall model, design patterns, and multi-agent collaboration to systematically enhance cohesion, reduce coupling, achieving clear responsibility boundaries and better maintainability. We also introduce \textbf{MaintainBench}, a benchmark comprising requirement changes and novel dynamic metrics on maintenance efforts. Experiments demonstrate that existing code generation methods struggle to meet maintainability standards when requirements evolve. In contrast, MaintainCoder improves dynamic maintainability metrics by more than 60\% with even higher correctness of initial codes. Furthermore, while static metrics fail to accurately reflect maintainability and even contradict each other, our proposed dynamic metrics exhibit high consistency. Our work not only provides the foundation for maintainable code generation, but also highlights the need for more realistic and comprehensive code generation research.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/MaintainCoder</p></details> |

However, there is an unignorable programming language bias in existing code benchmarks -- over 95% code generation benchmarks are dominated by Python, leaving the LLMs' capabilities in other programming languages such as Java and C/C++ unknown. Moreover, coding task bias is also crucial. Most benchmarks focus on code generation capability, while benchmarks for code reasoning (given input, reasoning output; and given output, reasoning input), an essential coding capability, are insufficient. Yet, constructing multi-lingual benchmarks can be expensive and labor-intensive, and codes in contest websites such as Leetcode suffer from data contamination during training. To fill this gap, we propose CRUXEVAL-X, a multi-lingual code reasoning benchmark that contains 19 programming languages. It comprises at least 600 subjects for each language, along with 19K content-consistent tests in total. In particular, the construction pipeline of CRUXEVAL-X works in a fully automated and test-guided manner, which iteratively generates and repairs based on execution feedback. Also, to cross language barriers (e.g., dynamic/static type systems in Python/C++), we formulated various transition rules between language pairs to facilitate translation. Our intensive evaluation of 24 representative LLMs reveals the correlation between language pairs. For example, TypeScript and JavaScript show a significant positive correlation, while Racket has less correlation with other languages. More interestingly, even a model trained solely on Python can achieve at most 34.4% Pass@1 in other languages, revealing the cross-language generalization of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>18pag...</summary><p>18pages, Accepted to ACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Defending Code Language Models against Backdoor Attacks with Deceptive Cross-Entropy Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08956v3)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code Language Models (CLMs), particularly those leveraging deep learning, have achieved significant success in code intelligence domain. However, the issue of security, particularly backdoor attacks, is often overlooked in this process. The previous research has focused on designing backdoor attacks for CLMs, but effective defenses have not been adequately addressed. In particular, existing defense methods from natural language processing, when directly applied to CLMs, are not effective enough and lack generality, working well in some models and scenarios but failing in others, thus fall short in consistently mitigating backdoor attacks. To bridge this gap, we first confirm the phenomenon of "early learning" as a general occurrence during the training of CLMs. This phenomenon refers to that a model initially focuses on the main features of training data but may become more sensitive to backdoor triggers over time, leading to overfitting and susceptibility to backdoor attacks. We then analyze that overfitting to backdoor triggers results from the use of the cross-entropy loss function, where the unboundedness of cross-entropy leads the model to increasingly concentrate on the features of the poisoned data. Based on this insight, we propose a general and effective loss function DeCE (Deceptive Cross-Entropy) by blending deceptive distributions and applying label smoothing to limit the gradient to bounded, which prevents the model from overfitting to backdoor triggers and then enhances the security of CLMs against backdoor attacks.</p></details> | TOSEM |
| **[A Self-Improving Coding Agent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15228v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have spurred interest in deploying LLM agents to undertake tasks in the world. LLMs are often deployed in agent systems: code that orchestrates LLM calls and provides them with tools. We demonstrate that an agent system, equipped with basic coding tools, can autonomously edit itself, and thereby improve its performance on benchmark tasks. We find performance gains from 17% to 53% on a random subset of SWE Bench Verified, with additional performance gains on LiveCodeBench, as well as synthetically generated agent benchmarks. Our work represents an advancement in the automated and open-ended design of agentic systems, and demonstrates a data-efficient, non gradient-based learning mechanism driven by LLM reflection and code updates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted as a preprint to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Improving Assembly Code Performance with Large Language Models via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11480v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance across a wide range of programming tasks, yet their potential for code optimization remains underexplored. This work investigates whether LLMs can optimize the performance of assembly code, where fine-grained control over execution enables improvements that are difficult to express in high-level languages. We present a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), guided by a reward function that considers both functional correctness, validated through test cases, and execution performance relative to the industry-standard compiler gcc -O3. To support this study, we introduce a benchmark of 8,072 real-world programs. Our model, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-PPO, achieves 96.0% test pass rates and an average speedup of 1.47x over the gcc -O3 baseline, outperforming all 20 other models evaluated, including Claude-3.7-sonnet. These results indicate that reinforcement learning can unlock the potential of LLMs to serve as effective optimizers for assembly code performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Compression Really Linear with Code Intelligence?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11441v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the relationship between data compression and the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial, especially in specialized domains like code intelligence. Prior work posited a linear relationship between compression and general intelligence. However, it overlooked the multifaceted nature of code that encompasses diverse programming languages and tasks, and struggled with fair evaluation of modern Code LLMs. We address this by evaluating a diverse array of open-source Code LLMs on comprehensive multi-language, multi-task code benchmarks. To address the challenge of efficient and fair evaluation of pre-trained LLMs' code intelligence, we introduce \textit{Format Annealing}, a lightweight, transparent training methodology designed to assess the intrinsic capabilities of these pre-trained models equitably. Compression efficacy, measured as bits-per-character (BPC), is determined using a novel, large-scale, and previously unseen code validation set derived from GitHub. Our empirical results reveal a fundamental logarithmic relationship between measured code intelligence and BPC. This finding refines prior hypotheses of linearity, which we suggest are likely observations of the logarithmic curve's tail under specific, limited conditions. Our work provides a more nuanced understanding of compression's role in developing code intelligence and contributes a robust evaluation framework in the code domain.</p></details> | work in progress |
| **[The dimension and Bose distance of certain primitive BCH codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01118v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bose-Ray-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH) codes are a significant class of cyclic codes that play an important role in both theoretical research and practical applications. Their strong error-correcting abilities and efficient encoding and decoding methods make BCH codes widely applicable in various areas, including communication systems, data storage devices, and consumer electronics. Although BCH codes have been extensively studied, the parameters of BCH codes are not known in general. Let $q$ be a prime power and $m$ be a positive integer. Denote by $\mathcal{C}_{(q,m,\delta)}$ the narrow-sense primitive BCH code with length $q^m-1$ and designed distance $\delta$. As of now, the dimensions of $\mathcal{C}_{(q,m,\delta)}$ are fully understood only for $m \leq 2$. For $m \geq 4$, the dimensions of $\mathcal{C}_{(q,m,\delta)}$ are known only for the range $2 \leq \delta \leq q^{\lfloor (m+1)/2 \rfloor +1}$ and for a limited number of special cases. In this paper, we determined the dimension and Bose distance of $\mathcal{C}_{(q,m,\delta)}$ for $m\geq 4$ and $\delta\in [2, q^{\lfloor ( 2m-1)/{3}\rfloor+1}]. $ Additionally, we have also extended our results to primitive BCH codes that are not necessarily narrow-sense.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we present StRuCom - the first large-scale dataset (153K examples) specifically designed for Russian code documentation. Unlike machine-translated English datasets that distort terminology (e.g., technical loanwords vs. literal translations) and docstring structures, StRuCom combines human-written comments from Russian GitHub repositories with synthetically generated ones, ensuring compliance with Python, Java, JavaScript, C#, and Go standards through automated validation. Fine-tuning Qwen2.5-Coder models (0.5B-7B) on StRuCom shows statistically significant improvements of chrf++ and BERTScore over baseline models.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Better Understanding of Program-of-Thought Reasoning in Cross-Lingual and Multilingual Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17956v2)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-step reasoning is essential for large language models (LLMs), yet multilingual performance remains challenging. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning, it struggles with non-English languages due to the entanglement of reasoning and execution. Program-of-Thought (PoT) prompting separates reasoning from execution, offering a promising alternative but shifting the challenge to generating programs from non-English questions. We propose a framework to evaluate PoT by separating multilingual reasoning from code execution to examine (i) the impact of fine-tuning on question-reasoning alignment and (ii) how reasoning quality affects answer correctness. Our findings demonstrate that PoT fine-tuning substantially enhances multilingual reasoning, outperforming CoT fine-tuned models. We further demonstrate a strong correlation between reasoning quality (measured through code quality) and answer accuracy, highlighting its potential as a test-time performance improvement heuristic.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can a domain-specific language improve program structure comprehension of data pipelines? A mixed-methods study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16764v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many application domains, domain-specific languages can allow domain experts to contribute to collaborative projects more correctly and efficiently. To do so, they must be able to understand program structure from reading existing source code. With high-quality data becoming an increasingly important resource, the creation of data pipelines is an important application domain for domain-specific languages. We execute a mixed-method study consisting of a controlled experiment and a follow-up descriptive survey among the participants to understand the effects of a domain-specific language on bottom-up program understanding and generate hypotheses for future research. During the experiment, participants need the same time to solve program structure comprehension tasks, but are significantly more correct when using the domain-specific language. In the descriptive survey, participants describe reasons related to the programming language itself, such as a better pipeline overview, more enforced code structure, and a closer alignment to the mental model of a data pipeline. In addition, human factors such as less required programming experience and the ability to reuse experience from other data engineering tools are discussed. Based on these results, domain-specific languages are a promising tool for creating data pipelines that can increase correct understanding of program structure and lower barriers to entry for domain experts. Open questions exist to make more informed implementation decisions for domain-specific languages for data pipelines in the future.</p></details> |  |

In this setting, the objective function associated with the optimization problem is a summation of a set of functions, each held by one node in a network. The semi-infinite constraint, on the other hand, is known to all agents. The nodes collectively aim to solve the problem using local data about the objective and limited communication capabilities depending on the network topology. Our algorithm is built on three key ingredients: consensus step, gradient descent in the local objective, and local gradient descent iterations in the constraint at a node when the estimate violates the semi-infinite constraint. The algorithm is constructed, and its parameters are prescribed in such a way that the iterates held by each agent provably converge to an optimizer. That is, as the algorithm progresses, the estimates achieve consensus, and the constraint violation and the error in the optimal value are bounded above by vanishing terms. Simulation examples illustrate our results.</p></details> | 16 pages, 1 figure |

Thus, our work serves a three-fold purpose: First, we present the first taxonomy of human feedback consolidating the entire programming process, which promotes fine-grained evaluation. Second, we introduce ELABORATIONSET, a novel programming dataset specifically designed for human-LLM collaboration, meticulously annotated to enable large-scale simulated human feedback and facilitate costeffective real human interaction studies. Third, we introduce ELABORATION, a novel benchmark to facilitate a thorough assessment of human-LLM competitive programming.

Song et al. The v7.3 introduced a new Clang-based C++ front-end to address the challenges posed by modern C++ programs. Although the new front-end has demonstrated significant potential in previous studies, it remains in the developmental stage and lacks several essential features. ESBMC v7.6 further enhanced this foundation by adding and extending features based on the Clang AST, such as 1) exception handling, 2) extended memory management and memory safety verification, including dangling pointers, duplicate deallocation, memory leaks and rvalue references and 3) new operational models for STL updating the outdated C++ operational models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ESBMC v7.6 can handle a significantly broader range of C++ features introduced in recent versions of the C++ standard.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 2 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2308.05649</p></details> |

We argue that successfully deploying AI software engineers requires a level of trust equal to or even greater than the trust established by human-driven software engineering practices. The recent trend toward LLM agents offers a path toward integrating the power of LLMs to create new code with the power of analysis tools to increase trust in the code. This opinion piece comments on whether LLM agents could dominate software engineering workflows in the future and whether the focus of programming will shift from programming at scale to programming with trust.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[Logic-of-Thought: Empowering Large Language Models with Logic Programs for Solving Puzzles in Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16114v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving puzzles in natural language poses a long-standing challenge in AI. While large language models (LLMs) have recently shown impressive capabilities in a variety of tasks, they continue to struggle with complex puzzles that demand precise reasoning and exhaustive search. In this paper, we propose Logic-of-Thought (Logot), a novel framework that bridges LLMs with logic programming to address this problem. Our method leverages LLMs to translate puzzle rules and states into answer set programs (ASPs), the solution of which are then accurately and efficiently inferred by an ASP interpreter. This hybrid approach combines the natural language understanding of LLMs with the precise reasoning capabilities of logic programs. We evaluate our method on various grid puzzles and dynamic puzzles involving actions, demonstrating near-perfect accuracy across all tasks. Our code and data are available at: https://github.com/naiqili/Logic-of-Thought.</p></details> |  |
| **[MPL: Multiple Programming Languages with Large Language Models for Information Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16107v1)** | 2025-05-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research in information extraction (IE) focuses on utilizing code-style inputs to enhance structured output generation. The intuition behind this is that the programming languages (PLs) inherently exhibit greater structural organization than natural languages (NLs). This structural advantage makes PLs particularly suited for IE tasks. Nevertheless, existing research primarily focuses on Python for code-style simulation, overlooking the potential of other widely-used PLs (e.g., C++ and Java) during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase. In this research, we propose \textbf{M}ultiple \textbf{P}rogramming \textbf{L}anguages with large language models for information extraction (abbreviated as \textbf{MPL}), a novel framework that explores the potential of incorporating different PLs in the SFT phase. Additionally, we introduce \texttt{function-prompt} with virtual running to simulate code-style inputs more effectively and efficiently. Experimental results on a wide range of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MPL. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to provide a comprehensive analysis. We have released our code for future research.</p></details> | Findings of ACL2025 |
| **[Data-driven Verification of Procedural Programs with Integer Arrays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15958v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of verifying automatically procedural programs manipulating parametric-size arrays of integers, encoded as a constrained Horn clauses solving problem. We propose a new algorithmic method for synthesizing loop invariants and procedure pre/post-conditions represented as universally quantified first-order formulas constraining the array elements and program variables. We adopt a data-driven approach that extends the decision tree Horn-ICE framework to handle arrays. We provide a powerful learning technique based on reducing a complex classification problem of vectors of integer arrays to a simpler classification problem of vectors of integers. The obtained classifier is generalized to get universally quantified invariants and procedure pre/post-conditions. We have implemented our method and shown its efficiency and competitiveness w.r.t. state-of-the-art tools on a significant benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Intermediate Program Representation for Optimizing Stream-Based Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21458v2)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stream-based runtime monitors are safety assurance tools that check at runtime whether the system's behavior satisfies a formal specification. Specifications consist of stream equations, which relate input streams, containing sensor readings and other incoming information, to output streams, representing filtered and aggregated data. This paper presents a framework for the stream-based specification language RTLola. We introduce a new intermediate representation for stream-based languages, the StreamIR, which, like the specification language, operates on streams of unbounded length; while the stream equations are replaced by imperative programs. We developed a set of optimizations based on static analysis of the specification and have implemented an interpreter and a compiler for several target languages. In our evaluation, we measure the performance of several real-world case studies. The results show that using the StreamIR framework reduces the runtime significantly compared to the existing StreamIR interpreter. We evaluate the effect of the optimizations and show that significant performance gains are possible beyond the optimizations of the target language's compiler. While our current implementation is limited to RTLola, the StreamIR is designed to accommodate other stream-based languages, enabling their interpretation and compilation into all available target languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Let's Take Esoteric Programming Languages Seriously](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15327v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Esoteric programming languages are challenging to learn, but their unusual features and constraints may serve to improve programming ability. From languages designed to be intentionally obtuse (e.g. INTERCAL) to others targeting artistic expression (e.g. Piet) or exploring the nature of computation (e.g. Fractan), there is rich variety in the realm of esoteric programming languages. This essay examines the counterintuitive appeal of esoteric languages and seeks to analyse reasons for this popularity. We will explore why people are attracted to esoteric languages in terms of (a) program comprehension and construction, as well as (b) language design and implementation. Our assertion is that esoteric languages can improve general PL awareness, at the same time as enabling the esoteric programmer to impress their peers with obscure knowledge. We will also consider pedagogic principles and the use of AI, in relation to esoteric languages. Emerging from the specific discussion, we identify a general set of 'good' reasons for designing new programming languages. It may not be possible to be exhaustive on this topic, and it is certain we have not achieved that goal here. However we believe our most important contribution is to draw attention to the varied and often implicit motivations involved in programming language design.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

However, existing ATCG methods often fail to meet complex specifications or generate effective corner cases, limiting their utility. In this work, we introduce Context-Free Grammars with Counters (CCFGs), a formalism that captures both syntactic and semantic structures in input specifications. Using a fine-tuned CodeT5 model, we translate natural language input specifications into CCFGs, enabling the systematic generation of high-quality test cases. Experiments on the CodeContests dataset demonstrate that CCFG-based test cases outperform baseline methods in identifying incorrect algorithms, achieving significant gains in validity and effectiveness. Our approach provides a scalable and reliable grammar-driven framework for enhancing automated competitive programming evaluations.</p></details> |  |
| **[EquiBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models' Understanding of Program Semantics via Equivalence Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12466v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become integral to code-related tasks, a central question emerges: do LLMs truly understand program execution semantics? We introduce EquiBench, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs through equivalence checking, i.e., determining whether two programs produce identical outputs for all possible inputs. Unlike prior code generation benchmarks, this task directly tests a model's understanding of code execution semantics. EquiBench consists of 2400 program pairs across four languages and six categories. These pairs are generated through program analysis, compiler scheduling, and superoptimization, ensuring high-confidence labels, nontrivial difficulty, and full automation. The transformations span syntactic edits, structural modifications, and algorithmic changes, covering a broad spectrum of semantic variation. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art LLMs and find that in the most challenging categories, the best accuracies are 63.8% and 76.2%, only modestly above the 50% random baseline. Further analysis reveals that models often rely on syntactic similarity rather than exhibiting robust reasoning over execution semantics, highlighting fundamental limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cassandra: Efficient Enforcement of Sequential Execution for Cryptographic Programs (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04290v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constant-time programming is a widely deployed approach to harden cryptographic programs against side channel attacks. However, modern processors often violate the underlying assumptions of standard constant-time policies by transiently executing unintended paths of the program. Despite many solutions proposed, addressing control flow misspeculations in an efficient way without losing performance is an open problem. In this work, we propose Cassandra, a novel hardware/software mechanism to enforce sequential execution for constant-time cryptographic code in a highly efficient manner. Cassandra explores the radical design point of disabling the branch predictor and recording-and-replaying sequential control flow of the program. Two key insights that enable our design are that (1) the sequential control flow of a constant-time program is mostly static over different runs, and (2) cryptographic programs are loop-intensive and their control flow patterns repeat in a highly compressible way. These insights allow us to perform an upfront branch analysis that significantly compresses control flow traces. We add a small component to a typical processor design, the Branch Trace Unit, to store compressed traces and determine fetch redirections according to the sequential model of the program. Despite providing a strong security guarantee, Cassandra counterintuitively provides an average 1.85% speedup compared to an unsafe baseline processor, mainly due to enforcing near-perfect fetch redirections.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables, 1 listing</p></details> |

This paper introduces a unified, foundational approach to verifying such programs. Central to our approach is the knitted-tree encoding, modeling each program execution as a tree structure capturing input, output, and intermediate states. Leveraging the compositional nature of knitted-trees, we encode these structures as constrained Horn clauses (CHCs), reducing verification to CHC satisfiability task. To illustrate our approach, we focus on memory safety and show how it naturally leads to simple, modular invariants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transductively Informed Inductive Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14744v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abstraction and reasoning in program synthesis has seen significant progress through both inductive and transductive paradigms. Inductive approaches generate a program or latent function from input-output examples, which can then be applied to new inputs. Transductive approaches directly predict output values for given inputs, effectively serving as the function themselves. Current approaches combine inductive and transductive models via isolated ensembling, but they do not explicitly model the interaction between both paradigms. In this work, we introduce \acs{tiips}, a novel framework that unifies transductive and inductive strategies by explicitly modeling their interactions through a cooperative mechanism: an inductive model generates programs, while a transductive model constrains, guides, and refines the search to improve synthesis accuracy and generalization. We evaluate \acs{tiips} on two widely studied program synthesis domains: string and list manipulation. Our results show that \acs{tiips} solves more tasks and yields functions that more closely match optimal solutions in syntax and semantics, particularly in out-of-distribution settings, yielding state-of-the-art performance. We believe that explicitly modeling the synergy between inductive and transductive reasoning opens promising avenues for general-purpose program synthesis and broader applications.</p></details> |  |

However, the complexity of modern bugs often makes precise root cause analysis difficult and unreliable. To address this challenge, we propose crash-site repair to simplify the repair task while still mitigating the risk of exploitation. In addition, we introduce a template-guided patch generation approach that significantly reduces the token cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining both efficiency and effectiveness. We implement our prototype system, WILLIAMT, and evaluate it against state-of-the-art APR tools. Our results show that, when combined with the top-performing agent CodeRover-S, WILLIAMT reduces token cost by 45.9% and increases the bug-fixing rate to 73.5% (+29.6%) on ARVO, a ground-truth open source software vulnerabilities benchmark. Furthermore, we demonstrate that WILLIAMT can function effectively even without access to frontier LLMs: even a local model running on a Mac M4 Mini achieves a reasonable repair rate. These findings highlight the broad applicability and scalability of WILLIAMT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Reasoning for Repair Based on Inferred Program Intent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13008v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has shown promising results, particularly with the use of neural networks. Currently, most APR tools focus on code transformations specified by test suites, rather than reasoning about the program intent and the high-level bug specification. Without a proper understanding of program intent, these tools tend to generate patches that overfit incomplete test suites and fail to reflect the developers intentions. However, reasoning about program intent is challenging. In our work, we propose an approach called AdverIntent-Agent, based on critique and adversarial reasoning. Our approach is novel to shift the focus from generating multiple APR patches to inferring multiple potential program intents. Ideally, we aim to infer intents that are, to some extent, adversarial to each other, maximizing the probability that at least one aligns closely with the developers original intent. AdverIntent-Agent is a multi-agent approach consisting of three agents: a reasoning agent, a test agent, and a repair agent. First, the reasoning agent generates adversarial program intents along with the corresponding faulty statements. Next, the test agent produces adversarial test cases that align with each inferred intent, constructing oracles that use the same inputs but have different expected outputs. Finally, the repair agent uses dynamic and precise LLM prompts to generate patches that satisfy both the inferred program intent and the generated tests. AdverIntent-Agent was evaluated on two benchmarks: Defects4J 2.0 and HumanEval-Java. AdverIntent-Agent correctly repaired 77 and 105 bugs in both benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[CPRet: A Dataset, Benchmark, and Model for Retrieval in Competitive Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12925v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competitive programming benchmarks are widely used in scenarios such as programming contests and large language model assessments. However, the growing presence of duplicate or highly similar problems raises concerns not only about competition fairness, but also about the validity of competitive programming as a benchmark for model evaluation. In this paper, we propose a new problem -- similar question retrieval -- to address this issue. Due to the lack of both data and models, solving this problem is challenging. To this end, we introduce CPRet, a retrieval-oriented benchmark suite for competitive programming, covering four retrieval tasks: two code-centric (i.e., Text-to-Code and Code-to-Code) and two newly proposed problem-centric tasks (i.e., Problem-to-Duplicate and Simplified-to-Full), built from a combination of automatically crawled problem-solution data and manually curated annotations. Our contribution includes both high-quality training data and temporally separated test sets for reliable evaluation. In addition, we develop two task-specialized retrievers based on this dataset: CPRetriever-Code, trained with a novel Group-InfoNCE loss for problem-code alignment, and CPRetriever-Prob, fine-tuned for identifying problem-level similarity. Both models achieve strong results and are open-sourced for local use. Finally, we analyze LiveCodeBench and find that high-similarity problems inflate model pass rates and reduce differentiation, underscoring the need for similarity-aware evaluation in future benchmarks.

| **[CodeGRAG: Bridging the Gap between Natural Language and Programming Language via Graphical Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02355v4)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing large language models to generate codes has shown promising meaning in software development revolution. Despite the intelligence shown by the large language models, their specificity in code generation can still be improved due to the syntactic gap and mismatched vocabulary existing between natural language and programming languages. In this paper, we propose CodeGRAG, a Graphical Retrieval Augmented Code Generation framework that bridges the gap between NL and PL to enhance the performance of LLMs. CodeGRAG builds the graphical view of code blocks based on the control flow and data flow of them to better interpret the programming domain knowledge, which can facilitate natural language based LLMs for better understanding of code syntax and serve as a bridge among different programming languages. To take the extracted structural knowledge into the foundation models, we propose 1) a hard meta-graph prompt template to transform the challenging syntax graph into informative graphical view for tuning-free models and 2) a soft prompting technique that injects the domain knowledge of programming languages into model parameters via finetuning the models with the soft signals encoded by GNN expert model. Specifically, two constraints are designed to improve the alignment and structure expressiveness, contributing to the informativeness of the single-token-sized external <GraphEmb> for enhanced code generation. CodeGRAG significantly improves the code generation ability of LLMs and can even offer performance gain for cross-lingual code generation. Implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Code-5970/ .</p></details> |  |

However, a significant performance disparity persists between popular programming languages (e.g., Python, C++) and others. To address this capability gap, we leverage the code translation task to train LLMs, thereby facilitating the transfer of coding proficiency across diverse programming languages. Moreover, we introduce OORL for training, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates on-policy and off-policy strategies. Within OORL, on-policy RL is applied during code translation, guided by a rule-based reward signal derived from unit tests. Complementing this coarse-grained rule-based reward, we propose Group Equivalent Preference Optimization (GEPO), a novel preference optimization method. Specifically, GEPO trains the LLM using intermediate representations (IRs) groups. LLMs can be guided to discern IRs equivalent to the source code from inequivalent ones, while also utilizing signals about the mutual equivalence between IRs within the group. This process allows LLMs to capture nuanced aspects of code functionality. By employing OORL for training with code translation tasks, LLMs improve their recognition of code functionality and their understanding of the relationships between code implemented in different languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our OORL for LLMs training with code translation tasks achieves significant performance improvements on code benchmarks across multiple programming languages.</p></details> |  |

However, prior AI applications lack support for text-to-parametric models, essential for generating and optimizing diverse parametric design options. This study introduces Text-to-Visual Programming (Text2VP) GPT, a novel generative AI derived from GPT-4.1, designed to automate graph-based visual programming workflows, parameters, and their interconnections. Text2VP leverages detailed documentation, specific instructions, and example-driven few-shot learning to reflect user intentions accurately and facilitate interactive parameter adjustments. Testing demonstrates Text2VP's capability in generating functional parametric models, although higher complexity models present increased error rates. This research highlights generative AI's potential in visual programming and parametric modeling, laying groundwork for future improvements to manage complex modeling tasks. Ultimately, Text2VP aims to enable designers to easily create and modify parametric models without extensive training in specialized platforms like Grasshopper.</p></details> | <details><summary>Demon...</summary><p>Demonstration Video: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUOmOLuLSaDWss2En2buixBxvTPy-lDvA</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Optimize for Mixed-Integer Non-linear Programming with Feasibility Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11061v9)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs) arise in domains as diverse as energy systems and transportation, but are notoriously difficult to solve, particularly at scale. While learning-to-optimize (L2O) methods have been successful at continuous optimization, extending them to MINLPs is challenging due to integer constraints. To overcome this, we propose a novel L2O approach with two integer correction layers to ensure the integrality of the solution and a projection step to ensure the feasibility of the solution. We prove that the projection step converges, providing a theoretical guarantee for our method. Our experiments show that our methods efficiently solve MINLPs with up to tens of thousands of variables, providing high-quality solutions within milliseconds, even for problems where traditional solvers and heuristics fail. This is the first general L2O method for parametric MINLPs, finding solutions to some of the largest instances reported to date.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Program Quantum Measurements for Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13525v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have sparked significant interest, driving extensive exploration of quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to address a wide range of complex challenges. The development of high-performance QML models requires expert-level expertise, presenting a key challenge to the widespread adoption of QML. Critical obstacles include the design of effective data encoding strategies and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which are vital for the performance of QML models. Furthermore, the measurement process is often neglected-most existing QML models employ predefined measurement schemes that may not align with the specific requirements of the targeted problem. We propose an innovative framework that renders the observable of a quantum system-specifically, the Hermitian matrix-trainable. This approach employs an end-to-end differentiable learning framework, enabling simultaneous optimization of the neural network used to program the parameterized observables and the standard quantum circuit parameters. Notably, the quantum observable parameters are dynamically programmed by the neural network, allowing the observables to adapt in real time based on the input data stream. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method effectively programs observables dynamically within variational quantum circuits, achieving superior results compared to existing approaches. Notably, it delivers enhanced performance metrics, such as higher classification accuracy, thereby significantly improving the overall effectiveness of QML models.</p></details> |  |
| **[EVALOOP: Assessing LLM Robustness in Programming from a Self-consistency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12185v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing the programming capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for their effective use in software engineering. Current evaluations, however, predominantly measure the accuracy of generated code on static benchmarks, neglecting the critical aspect of model robustness during programming tasks. While adversarial attacks offer insights on model robustness, their effectiveness is limited and evaluation could be constrained. Current adversarial attack methods for robustness evaluation yield inconsistent results, struggling to provide a unified evaluation across different LLMs. We introduce EVALOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluate the robustness from a self-consistency perspective, i.e., leveraging the natural duality inherent in popular software engineering tasks, e.g., code generation and code summarization. EVALOOP initiates a self-contained feedback loop: an LLM generates output (e.g., code) from an input (e.g., natural language specification), and then use the generated output as the input to produce a new output (e.g., summarizes that code into a new specification). EVALOOP repeats the process to assess the effectiveness of EVALOOP in each loop. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without rely on any external attack setups, providing a unified metric to evaluate LLMs' robustness in programming. We evaluate 16 prominent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.1, O4-mini) on EVALOOP and found that EVALOOP typically induces a 5.01%-19.31% absolute drop in pass@1 performance within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, GPT-3.5-Turbo, despite superior initial code generation compared to DeepSeek-V2, demonstrated lower robustness over repeated evaluation loop.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |

Recently, data-driven approaches have emerged as a promising solution, automatically learning heuristics that perform well on training instances and generalize to unseen test cases. Such an approach learns (meta-)heuristics that can perform well on the training instances, expecting it to generalize well on the unseen test instances. A recent method, named GPGLS, uses Genetic Programming (GP) to learn the utility function in Guided Local Search (GLS) and solved large scale VRP effectively. However, the selection of appropriate training instances during the learning process remains an open question, with most existing studies including GPGLS relying on random instance selection. To address this, we propose a novel method, CL-GPGLS, which integrates Curriculum Learning (CL) into GPGLS. Our approach leverages a predefined curriculum to introduce training instances progressively, starting with simpler tasks and gradually increasing complexity, enabling the model to better adapt and optimize for large-scale VRP (LSVRP). Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of CL-GPGLS, demonstrating significant performance improvements over three baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Co-Evolutionary Defence of Active Directory Attack Graphs via GNN-Approximated Dynamic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11710v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern enterprise networks increasingly rely on Active Directory (AD) for identity and access management. However, this centralization exposes a single point of failure, allowing adversaries to compromise high-value assets. Existing AD defense approaches often assume static attacker behavior, but real-world adversaries adapt dynamically, rendering such methods brittle. To address this, we model attacker-defender interactions in AD as a Stackelberg game between an adaptive attacker and a proactive defender. We propose a co-evolutionary defense framework that combines Graph Neural Network Approximated Dynamic Programming (GNNDP) to model attacker strategies, with Evolutionary Diversity Optimization (EDO) to generate resilient blocking strategies. To ensure scalability, we introduce a Fixed-Parameter Tractable (FPT) graph reduction method that reduces complexity while preserving strategic structure. Our framework jointly refines attacker and defender policies to improve generalization and prevent premature convergence. Experiments on synthetic AD graphs show near-optimal results (within 0.1 percent of optimality on r500) and improved performance on larger graphs (r1000 and r2000), demonstrating the framework's scalability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalization Guarantees for Learning Branch-and-Cut Policies in Integer Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11636v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-integer programming (MIP) provides a powerful framework for optimization problems, with Branch-and-Cut (B&C) being the predominant algorithm in state-of-the-art solvers. The efficiency of B&C critically depends on heuristic policies for making sequential decisions, including node selection, cut selection, and branching variable selection. While traditional solvers often employ heuristics with manually tuned parameters, recent approaches increasingly leverage machine learning, especially neural networks, to learn these policies directly from data. A key challenge is to understand the theoretical underpinnings of these learned policies, particularly their generalization performance from finite data. This paper establishes rigorous sample complexity bounds for learning B&C policies where the scoring functions guiding each decision step (node, cut, branch) have a certain piecewise polynomial structure. This structure generalizes the linear models that form the most commonly deployed policies in practice and investigated recently in a foundational series of theoretical works by Balcan et al. Such piecewise polynomial policies also cover the neural network architectures (e.g., using ReLU activations) that have been the focal point of contemporary practical studies. Consequently, our theoretical framework closely reflects the models utilized by practitioners investigating machine learning within B&C, offering a unifying perspective relevant to both established theory and modern empirical research in this area. Furthermore, our theory applies to quite general sequential decision making problems beyond B&C.</p></details> |  |

Tubular structures naturally yield circular cross-sections when inflated, whereas a robotic sling must be both thin enough to grow between them and their resting surface and wide enough to cradle the human. Recent works have achieved flattened cross-sections by including rigid components into the structure, but this reduces conformability to the human. We present a method of mechanically programming the cross-section of soft everting robotic structures using flexible strips that constrain radial expansion between points along the outer membrane. Our method enables simultaneously wide and thin profiles while maintaining the full multi-axis flexibility of traditional slings. We develop and validate a model relating the geometric design specifications to the fabrication parameters, and experimentally characterize their effects on growth rate. Finally, we prototype a soft growing robotic sling system and demonstrate its use for assisting a single caregiver in bed-to-chair patient transfer.</p></details> |  |

However, a notable limitation of most ZC proxies is their inconsistency, as reflected by the substantial variation in their performance across different problems. Furthermore, the design of existing ZC metrics is manual, involving a time-consuming trial-and-error process that requires substantial domain expertise. These challenges raise two critical questions: (1) Can we automate the design of ZC metrics? and (2) Can we utilize the existing hand-crafted ZC metrics to synthesize a more generalizable one? In this study, we propose a framework based on Symbolic Regression via Genetic Programming to automate the design of ZC metrics. Our framework is not only highly extensible but also capable of quickly producing a ZC metric with a strong positive rank correlation to true network performance across diverse NAS search spaces and tasks. Extensive experiments on 13 problems from NAS-Bench-Suite-Zero demonstrate that our automatically generated proxies consistently outperform hand-crafted alternatives. Using our evolved proxy metric as the search objective in an evolutionary algorithm, we could identify network architectures with competitive performance within 15 minutes using a single consumer GPU.</p></details> |  |

By identifying specific issues students face, educators can provide targeted assistance to help them overcome obstacles and improve learning outcomes. While identifying sources of struggle, such as misconceptions, in real-time can be challenging in current educational practices, analyzing logical errors in students' code can offer valuable insights. This paper presents a scalable framework for automatically detecting logical errors in students' programming solutions. Our framework is based on an explainable Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) embedding model, the Subtree-based Attention Neural Network (SANN), that identifies the structural components of programs containing logical errors. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate its effectiveness, and the results suggest that our framework can accurately capture students' logical errors and, more importantly, provide us with deeper insights into their learning processes, offering a valuable tool for enhancing programming education.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 18th International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM), 2025</p></details> |

This paper investigates the case of class accuracy imbalance in LLMs, where deeply entangled pretraining biases and prompt-specific cues contribute to the imbalance. To overcome the difficulty in bias identification and inaccessibility of retraining, we post-hoc balance class accuracy using only output probabilities. This is enabled by reformulating debiasing as a combinatorial optimization problem. In details, we first motivate a post-hoc bias metric, the Contextual Oddity Bias (COBias), to quantify the over-/under-prediction (a tendency to over-predict some classes while under-predicting others) in LLMs. We then propose the Debiasing as Nonlinear Integer Programming (DNIP) method to reweight LLM output class probabilities towards minimizing COBias and max12 imizing overall accuracy, without being constrained by bias sources or updating LLM parameters. Since the DNIP model contains non-differentiable elements, we use simulated annealing to efficiently solve it. Evaluations on five LLMs across NLP classification benchmarks show that DNIP simultaneously achieves signifi16 cant COBias reduction (61% relative reduction) and accuracy improvement (18% relative increase) under different LLM prompting setups.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor Network Structure Search with Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02711v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor networks provide a powerful framework for compressing multi-dimensional data. The optimal tensor network structure for a given data tensor depends on both data characteristics and specific optimality criteria, making tensor network structure search a difficult problem. Existing solutions typically rely on sampling and compressing numerous candidate structures; these procedures are computationally expensive and therefore limiting for practical applications. We address this challenge by viewing tensor network structure search as a program synthesis problem and introducing an efficient constraint-based assessment method that avoids costly tensor decomposition. Specifically, we establish a correspondence between transformation programs and network structures. We also design a novel operation named output-directed splits to reduce the search space without hindering expressiveness. We then propose a synthesis algorithm to identify promising network candidates through constraint solving, and avoid tensor decomposition for all but the most promising candidates. Experimental results show that our approach improves search speed by up to $10\times$ and achieves compression ratios $1.5\times$ to $3\times$ better than state-of-the-art. Notably, our approach scales to larger tensors that are unattainable by prior work. Furthermore, the discovered topologies generalize well to similar data, yielding compression ratios up to $ 2.4\times$ better than a generic structure while the runtime remains around $110$ seconds.</p></details> |  |

Though these models have achieved the state-of-the-art performance for SE tasks for many popular programming languages, such as Java and Python, the Scientific Software and its related languages like R programming language have rarely benefited or even been evaluated with the Code-PLMs. Research has shown that R has many differences with other programming languages and requires specific techniques. In this study, we provide the first insights for code intelligence for R. For this purpose, we collect and open source an R dataset, and evaluate Code-PLMs for the two tasks of code summarization and method name prediction using several settings and strategies, including the differences in two R styles, Tidy-verse and Base R. Our results demonstrate that the studied models have experienced varying degrees of performance degradation when processing R programming language code, which is supported by human evaluation. Additionally, not all models show performance improvement in R-specific tasks even after multi-language fine-tuning. The dual syntax paradigms in R significantly impact the models' performance, particularly in code summarization tasks. Furthermore, the project-specific context inherent in R codebases significantly impacts the performance when attempting cross-project training.</p></details> |  |

However, most modern integrated development environments (IDEs) have not fully adapted to this paradigm shift. For example, physical 3D objects in the real world are still represented as 2D text variables in code, creating a significant perceptual distance between these representations. In response to this challenge, we introduce SnapNCode, a novel IDE for spatial programming. SnapNCode enables programmers to capture various states of physical objects through live video streams from cameras and directly insert these visual representations into their code. Moreover, users can augment physical objects by attaching code snippets onto objects, which are opportunistically triggered when observed by cameras. We conducted a user study (N=12) to assess the usability of SnapNCode. Feedback from participants indicates that the system is easy-to-use and holds promise for daily casual uses and integration into a broader range of workflows.</p></details> | 18 pages, HCII 2025 |

P4, a language designed for programming data-plane devices, allows developers to define custom packet processing behaviors directly on programmable network devices. This provides greater control over packet forwarding, inspection, and modification. However, the increased flexibility provided by P4 also brings significant security challenges, particularly in managing sensitive data and preventing information leakage within the data-plane. This paper presents a novel security type system for analyzing information flow in P4 programs that combines security types with interval analysis. The proposed type system allows the specification of security policies in terms of input and output packet bit fields rather than program variables. We formalize this type system and prove it sound, guaranteeing that well-typed programs satisfy noninterference. Our prototype implementation, Tap4s, is evaluated on several use cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting security violations and information leakages.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, including references and appendix.

To address this gap, we introduce a closed-form formula for single-variable changes, establishing novel necessary and sufficient conditions for 1-Opt local improvement in UQIP and CQIP. We develop a simple local and sophisticated tabu search with an oscillation strategy tailored for large-scale problems. Experimental results on instances with up to 8000 variables demonstrate the efficiency of these strategies, producing high-quality solutions within a short time.

They require quantum programs that define operations on quantum bits (qubits), the fundamental units of computation. Unlike traditional software development, the process of creating and debugging quantum programs requires specialized knowledge of quantum computation, making the development process more challenging. In this paper, we apply and evaluate mutation-based fault localization (MBFL) for quantum programs with the aim of enhancing debugging efficiency. We use quantum mutation operations, which are specifically designed for quantum programs, to identify faults. Our evaluation involves 23 real-world faults and 305 artificially induced faults in quantum programs developed with Qiskit(R). The results show that real-world faults are more challenging for MBFL than artificial faults. In fact, the median EXAM score, which represents the percentage of the code examined before locating the faulty statement (lower is better), is 1.2% for artificial benchmark and 19.4% for the real-world benchmark in the worst-case scenario. Our study highlights the potential and limitations of MBFL for quantum programs, considering different fault types and mutation operation types. Finally, we discuss future directions for improving MBFL in the context of quantum programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, Accepted at Short Papers, Emerging Results in the International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE), 2025</p></details> |

| **[Comparing Parallel Functional Array Languages: Programming and Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08906v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parallel functional array languages are an emerging class of programming languages that promise to combine low-effort parallel programming with good performance and performance portability. We systematically compare the designs and implementations of five different functional array languages: Accelerate, APL, DaCe, Futhark, and SaC. We demonstrate the expressiveness of functional array programming by means of four challenging benchmarks, namely N-body simulation, MultiGrid, Quickhull, and Flash Attention. These benchmarks represent a range of application domains and parallel computational models. We argue that the functional array code is much shorter and more comprehensible than the hand-optimized baseline implementations because it omits architecture-specific aspects. Instead, the language implementations generate both multicore and GPU executables from a single source code base. Hence, we further argue that functional array code could more easily be ported to, and optimized for, new parallel architectures than conventional implementations of numerical kernels. We demonstrate this potential by reporting the performance of the five parallel functional array languages on a total of 39 instances of the four benchmarks on both a 32-core AMD EPYC 7313 multicore system and on an NVIDIA A30 GPU. We explore in-depth why each language performs well or not so well on each benchmark and architecture. We argue that the results demonstrate that mature functional array languages have the potential to deliver performance competitive with the best available conventional techniques.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, if a quantum party can execute a semi-quantum token scheme (Shmueli 2022) with probability of success $1/2 + \delta$, we can build powerful cryptographic primitives with a multiplicative logarithmic overhead for the desired correctness error. Our scheme makes no assumptions about the quantum party's noise model except for a simple independence requirement: noise on two sets of non-entangled hardware must be independent. Using semi-quantum tokens and oracles which can only be queried classically, we first show how to construct a "short-lived" semi-quantum one-time program (OTP) which allows a classical sending party to prepare a one-time program on the receiving party's quantum computer. We then show how to use this semi-quantum OTP to construct a semi-quantum "stateful obfuscation" scheme (which we term "RAM obfuscation"). Importantly, the RAM obfuscation scheme does not require long-term quantum memory or global entanglement. Finally, we show how RAM obfuscation can be used to build long-lived one-time programs and copy-protection schemes.</p></details> |  |

However, these applications remain insufficiently automated and struggle to effectively integrate various types of information during the programming process, including coding history, current code, and user instructions. In this work, we propose a new conversational framework that comprehensively integrates these information sources, collect data to train our models and evaluate their performance. Firstly, to thoroughly evaluate how well models align with different types of information and the quality of their outputs, we introduce a new benchmark, APEval (Assist Programming Eval), to comprehensively assess the performance of models in programming assistance tasks. Then, for data collection, we develop a data generation pipeline, Programming-Instruct, which synthesizes training data from diverse sources, such as GitHub and online judge platforms. This pipeline can automatically generate various types of messages throughout the programming process. Finally, using this pipeline, we generate 219K samples, fine-tune multiple models, and develop the CursorCore series. We show that CursorCore outperforms other models of comparable size.

| **[A Quantum Constraint Generation Framework for Binary Linear Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21222v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new approach to utilize quantum computers for binary linear programming (BLP), which can be extended to general integer linear programs (ILP). Quantum optimization algorithms, hybrid or quantum-only, are currently general purpose, standalone solvers for ILP. However, to consider them practically useful, we expect them to overperform the current state of the art classical solvers. That expectation is unfair to quantum algorithms: in classical ILP solvers, after many decades of evolution, many different algorithms work together as a robust machine to get the best result. This is the approach we would like to follow now with our quantum 'solver' solutions. In this study we wrap any suitable quantum optimization algorithm into a quantum informed classical constraint generation framework. First we relax our problem by dropping all constraints and encode it into an Ising Hamiltonian for the quantum optimization subroutine. Then, by sampling from the solution state of the subroutine, we obtain information about constraint violations in the initial problem, from which we decide which coupling terms we need to introduce to the Hamiltonian. The coupling terms correspond to the constraints of the initial binary linear program. Then we optimize over the new Hamiltonian again, until we reach a feasible solution, or other stopping conditions hold. Since one can decide how many constraints they add to the Hamiltonian in a single step, our algorithm is at least as efficient as the (hybrid) quantum optimization algorithm it wraps. We support our claim with results on small scale minimum cost exact cover problem instances.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Failure of Plagiarism Detection in Competitive Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08244v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Plagiarism in programming courses remains a persistent challenge, especially in competitive programming contexts where assignments often have unique, known solutions. This paper examines why traditional code plagiarism detection methods frequently fail in these environments and explores the implications of emerging factors such as generative AI (genAI). Drawing on the author's experience teaching a Competitive Programming 1 (CP1) course over seven semesters at Purdue University (with $\approx 100$ students each term) and completely redesigning the CP1/2/3 course sequence, we provide an academically grounded analysis. We review literature on code plagiarism in computer science education, survey current detection tools (Moss, Kattis, etc.) and methods (manual review, code-authorship interviews), and analyze their strengths and limitations. Experience-based observations are presented to illustrate real-world detection failures and successes. We find that widely-used automated similarity checkers can be thwarted by simple code transformations or novel AI-generated code, while human-centric approaches like oral interviews, though effective, are labor-intensive. The paper concludes with opinions and preliminary recommendations for improving academic integrity in programming courses, advocating for a multi-faceted approach that combines improved detection algorithms, mastery-based learning techniques, and authentic assessment practices to better ensure code originality.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables, submitted for publication</p></details> |

An Empirical Evaluation of Generative AI as a Collaborative Teammate in a Semester-Long Classroom Setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08119v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI (GenAI), especially Large Language Models (LLMs), is rapidly reshaping both programming workflows and computer science education. Many programmers now incorporate GenAI tools into their workflows, including for collaborative coding tasks such as pair programming. While prior research has demonstrated the benefits of traditional pair programming and begun to explore GenAI-assisted coding, the role of LLM-based tools as collaborators in pair programming remains underexamined. In this work, we conducted a mixed-methods study with 39 undergraduate students to examine how GenAI influences collaboration, learning, and performance in pair programming. Specifically, students completed six in-class assignments under three conditions: Traditional Pair Programming (PP), Pair Programming with GenAI (PAI), and Solo Programming with GenAI (SAI). They used both LLM-based inline completion tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) and LLM-based conversational tools (e.g., ChatGPT). Our results show that students in PAI achieved the highest assignment scores, whereas those in SAI attained the lowest. Additionally, students' attitudes toward LLMs' programming capabilities improved significantly after collaborating with LLM-based tools, and preferences were largely shaped by the perceived usefulness for completing assignments and learning programming skills, as well as the quality of collaboration. Our qualitative findings further reveal that while students appreciated LLM-based tools as valuable pair programming partners, they also identified limitations and had different expectations compared to human teammates. Our study provides one of the first empirical evaluations of GenAI as a pair programming collaborator through a comparison of three conditions (PP, PAI, and SAI). We also discuss the design implications and pedagogical considerations for future GenAI-assisted pair programming approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Learning @ Scale 2025</p></details> |

The Clarke subdifferential and surrogate functions are not readily obtainable due to the latent decision dependency. To deal with such a computational difficulty, we develop an adaptive learning-based surrogate method that integrates the simulation scheme and statistical estimates to construct estimation-based surrogate functions in a way that the simulation process is adaptively guided by the algorithmic procedure. We establish the non-asymptotic convergence rate analysis in terms of $(\nu, \delta)$-near stationarity in expectation under variable proximal parameters and batch sizes, which exhibits the superior convergence performance and enhanced stability in both theory and practice. We provide numerical results with both synthetic and real data which illustrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm in terms of algorithmic stability and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATiM: Autotuning Tensor Programs for Processing-in-DRAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19630v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Processing-in-DRAM (DRAM-PIM) has emerged as a promising technology for accelerating memory-intensive operations in modern applications, such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its potential, current software stacks for DRAM-PIM face significant challenges, including reliance on hand-tuned libraries that hinder programmability, limited support for high-level abstractions, and the lack of systematic optimization frameworks. To address these limitations, we present ATiM, a search-based optimizing tensor compiler for UPMEM. Key features of ATiM include: (1) automated searches of the joint search space for host and kernel tensor programs, (2) PIM-aware optimizations for efficiently handling boundary conditions, and (3) improved search algorithms for the expanded search space of UPMEM systems. Our experimental results on UPMEM hardware demonstrate performance gains of up to 6.18$\times$ for various UPMEM benchmark kernels and 8.21$\times$ for GPT-J layers. To the best of our knowledge, ATiM is the first tensor compiler to provide fully automated, autotuning-integrated code generation support for a DRAM-PIM system. By bridging the gap between high-level tensor computation abstractions and low-level hardware-specific requirements, ATiM establishes a foundation for advancing DRAM-PIM programmability and enabling streamlined optimization.</p></details> | 17 pages, 15 figures |
| **[A Black-box Testing Framework for Oracle Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07243v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Oracle quantum programs are a fundamental class of quantum programs that serve as a critical bridge between quantum computing and classical computing. Many important quantum algorithms are built upon oracle quantum programs, making it essential to ensure their correctness during development. While software testing is a well-established approach for improving program reliability, no systematic method has been developed to test oracle quantum programs. This paper proposes a black-box testing framework designed for general oracle quantum programs. We define these programs formally, establish the foundational theory for their testing, and propose a detailed testing framework. We develop a prototype tool and conduct extensive experimental evaluations to evaluate the framework's effectiveness. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly aids developers in testing oracle quantum programs, providing insights to enhance the reliability of quantum software.</p></details> | 35 pages, 8 figures |
| **[LLM-Guided Probabilistic Program Induction for POMDP Model Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02216v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) model decision making under uncertainty. While there are many approaches to approximately solving POMDPs, we aim to address the problem of learning such models. In particular, we are interested in a subclass of POMDPs wherein the components of the model, including the observation function, reward function, transition function, and initial state distribution function, can be modeled as low-complexity probabilistic graphical models in the form of a short probabilistic program. Our strategy to learn these programs uses an LLM as a prior, generating candidate probabilistic programs that are then tested against the empirical distribution and adjusted through feedback. We experiment on a number of classical toy POMDP problems, simulated MiniGrid domains, and two real mobile-base robotics search domains involving partial observability. Our results show that using an LLM to guide in the construction of a low-complexity POMDP model can be more effective than tabular POMDP learning, behavior cloning, or direct LLM planning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Crypto-Economic Analysis of Web3 Funding Programs Using the Grant Maturity Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06801v1)** | 2025-05-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web3 grant programs are evolving mechanisms aimed at supporting innovation within the blockchain ecosystem, yet little is known on about their effectiveness. This paper proposes the concept of maturity to fill this gap and introduces the Grant Maturity Framework (GMF), a mixed-methods model for evaluating the maturity of Web3 grant programs. The GMF provides a systematic approach to assessing the structure, governance, and impact of Web3 grants, applied here to four prominent Ethereum layer-two (L2) grant programs: Arbitrum, Optimism, Mantle, and Taiko. By evaluating these programs using the GMF, the study categorizes them into four maturity stages, ranging from experimental to advanced. The findings reveal that Arbitrum's Long-Term Incentive Pilot Program (LTIPP) and Optimism's Mission Rounds show higher maturity, while Mantle and Taiko are still in their early stages. The research concludes by discussing the user-centric development of a Web3 grant management platform aimed at improving the maturity and effectiveness of Web3 grant management processes based on the findings from the GMF. This work contributes to both practical and theoretical knowledge on Web3 grant program evaluation and tooling, providing a valuable resource for Web3 grant operators and stakeholders.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Collaborative Conversational Agent System Based on LLMs and Answer Set Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06438v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the Large-Language-Model-driven (LLM-driven) Artificial Intelligence (AI) bots became popular, people realized their strong potential in Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD). However, bots relying wholly on LLMs are unreliable in their knowledge, and whether they can finally produce a correct result for the task is not guaranteed. The collaboration among these agents also remains a challenge, since the necessary information to convey is unclear, and the information transfer is by prompts -- unreliable, and malicious knowledge is easy to inject. With the help of logic programming tools such as Answer Set Programming (ASP), conversational agents can be built safely and reliably, and communication among the agents made more efficient and secure. We proposed an Administrator-Assistant Dual-Agent paradigm, where the two ASP-driven bots share the same knowledge base and complete their tasks independently, while the information can be passed by a Collaborative Rule Set (CRS). The knowledge and information conveyed are encapsulated and invisible to the users, ensuring the security of information transmission. We have constructed AutoManager, a dual-agent system for managing the drive-through window of a fast-food restaurant such as Taco Bell in the US. In AutoManager, the assistant bot takes the customer's order while the administrator bot manages the menu and food supply. We evaluated our AutoManager and compared it with the real-world Taco Bell Drive-Thru AI Order Taker, and the results show that our method is more reliable.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[From Observation to Orientation: an Adaptive Integer Programming Approach to Intervention Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03122v3)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Using both observational and experimental data, a causal discovery process can identify the causal relationships between variables. A unique adaptive intervention design paradigm is presented in this work, where causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are for effectively recovered with practical budgetary considerations. In order to choose treatments that optimize information gain under these considerations, an iterative integer programming (IP) approach is proposed, which drastically reduces the number of experiments required. Simulations over a broad range of graph sizes and edge densities are used to assess the effectiveness of the suggested approach. Results show that the proposed adaptive IP approach achieves full causal graph recovery with fewer intervention iterations and variable manipulations than random intervention baselines, and it is also flexible enough to accommodate a variety of practical constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[JustinANN: Realistic Test Generation for Java Programs Driven by Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05715v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated test case generation is important. However, the automatically generated test input does not always make sense, and the automated assertion is difficult to validate against the program under test. In this paper, we propose JustinANN, a flexible and scalable tool to generate test cases for Java programs, providing realistic test inputs and assertions. We have observed that, in practice, Java programs contain a large number of annotations from programs, which can be considered as part of the user specification. We design a systematic annotation set with 7 kinds of annotations and 4 combination rules based on them to modify complex Java objects. Annotations that modify the fields or return variables of methods can be used to generate assertions that represent the true intent of the program, and the ones that modify the input parameters can be used to generate test inputs that match the real business requirement. We have conducted experiments to evaluate the approach on open source Java programs. The results show that the annotations and their combinations designed in this paper are compatible with existing annotations; our approach is easier to generate test data in, on and outside the boundaries of the requirement domain; and it also helps to find program defects.</p></details> |  |
| **[ICNN-enhanced 2SP: Leveraging input convex neural networks for solving two-stage stochastic programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05261v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Two-stage stochastic programming (2SP) offers a basic framework for modelling decision-making under uncertainty, yet scalability remains a challenge due to the computational complexity of recourse function evaluation. Existing learning-based methods like Neural Two-Stage Stochastic Programming (Neur2SP) employ neural networks (NNs) as recourse function surrogates but rely on computationally intensive mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations. We propose ICNN-enhanced 2SP, a method that leverages Input Convex Neural Networks (ICNNs) to exploit linear programming (LP) representability in convex 2SP problems. By architecturally enforcing convexity and enabling exact inference through LP, our approach eliminates the need for integer variables inherent to the conventional MIP-based formulation while retaining an exact embedding of the ICNN surrogate within the 2SP framework. This results in a more computationally efficient alternative that maintains solution quality. Comprehensive experiments reveal that ICNNs incur only marginally longer training times while achieving validation accuracy on par with their MIP-based counterparts. Across benchmark problems, ICNN-enhanced 2SP often exhibits considerably faster solution times than the MIP-based formulations while preserving solution quality, with these advantages becoming significantly more pronounced as problem scale increases. For the most challenging instances, the method achieves speedups of up to 100$\times$ and solution quality superior to MIP-based formulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Neural Pathways to Program Success: Hopfield Networks for PERT Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05047v1)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Project and task scheduling under uncertainty remains a fundamental challenge in program and project management, where accurate estimation of task durations and dependencies is critical for delivering complex, multi project systems. The Program Evaluation and Review Technique provides a probabilistic framework to model task variability and critical paths. In this paper, the author presents a novel formulation of PERT scheduling as an energy minimization problem within a Hopfield neural network architecture. By mapping task start times and precedence constraints into a neural computation framework, the networks inherent optimization dynamics is exploited to approximate globally consistent schedules. The author addresses key theoretical issues related to energy function differentiability, constraint encoding, and convergence, and extends the Hopfield model for structured precedence graphs. Numerical simulations on synthetic project networks comprising up to 1000 tasks demonstrate the viability of this approach, achieving near optimal makespans with minimal constraint violations. The findings suggest that neural optimization models offer a promising direction for scalable and adaptive project tasks scheduling under uncertainty in areas such as the agentic AI workflows, microservice based applications that the modern AI systems are being built upon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Facilitating Instructors-LLM Collaboration for Problem Design in Introductory Programming Classrooms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01259v2)** | 2025-05-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, offer significant opportunities to enhance instructional support in introductory programming courses. While extensive research has explored the effectiveness of LLMs in supporting student learning, limited studies have examined how these models can assist instructors in designing instructional activities. This work investigates how instructors' expertise in effective activity design can be integrated with LLMs' ability to generate novel and targeted programming problems, facilitating more effective activity creation for programming classrooms. To achieve this, we employ a participatory design approach to develop an instructor-authoring tool that incorporates LLM support, fostering collaboration between instructors and AI in generating programming exercises. This tool also allows instructors to specify common student mistakes and misconceptions, which informs the adaptive feedback generation process. We conduct case studies with three instructors, analyzing how they use our system to design programming problems for their introductory courses. Through these case studies, we assess instructors' perceptions of the usefulness and limitations of LLMs in authoring problem statements for instructional purposes. Additionally, we compare the efficiency, quality, effectiveness, and coverage of designed activities when instructors create problems with and without structured LLM prompting guidelines. Our findings provide insights into the potential of LLMs in enhancing instructor workflows and improving programming education and provide guidelines for designing effective AI-assisted problem-authoring interfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CHI 2025 Workshop on Augmented Educators and AI: Shaping the Future of Human and AI Cooperation in Learning</p></details> |

However, the inner mechanism of CoT still remains largely unclear. In this paper, we empirically study the role of CoT tokens in LLMs on two compositional tasks: multi-digit multiplication and dynamic programming. While CoT is essential for solving these problems, we find that preserving only tokens that store intermediate results would achieve comparable performance. Furthermore, we observe that storing intermediate results in an alternative latent form will not affect model performance. We also randomly intervene some values in CoT, and notice that subsequent CoT tokens and the final answer would change correspondingly. These findings suggest that CoT tokens may function like variables in computer programs but with potential drawbacks like unintended shortcuts and computational complexity limits between tokens. The code and data are available at https://github.com/solitaryzero/CoTs_are_Variables.</p></details> |  |

To manage this crucial challenge, we employed a novel design process based on a large-scale, longitudinal, community-based structure. Across three annual programs we engaged with the BVI community in online and in-person modes. In total, our team included 67 total BVI participatory design participants online, 11 BVI co-designers in-person, and 4 BVI program coordinators. Through this design process we built a mobile application that enables users to generate, share, and navigate maps of indoor and outdoor environments without the need to instrument each environment with beacons or fiducial markers. We evaluated this app at a healthcare facility, and participants in the evaluation rated the app highly with respect to its design, features, and potential for positive impact on quality of life.</p></details> |  |

However, most approaches to LLM-based APR are limited to the static analysis of the programs, while disregarding their runtime behavior. Inspired by knowledge-augmented NLP, in this work, we aim to remedy this potential blind spot by augmenting standard APR prompts with program execution traces. We evaluate our approach using the GPT family of models on three popular APR datasets. Our findings suggest that simply incorporating execution traces into the prompt provides a limited performance improvement over trace-free baselines, in only 2 out of 6 tested dataset / model configurations. We further find that the effectiveness of execution traces for APR diminishes as their complexity increases. We explore several strategies for leveraging traces in prompts and demonstrate that LLM-optimized prompts help outperform trace-free prompts more consistently. Additionally, we show trace-based prompting to be superior to finetuning a smaller LLM on a small-scale dataset; and conduct probing studies reinforcing the notion that execution traces can complement the reasoning abilities of the LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond entropic regularization: Debiased Gaussian estimators for discrete optimal transport and general linear programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04312v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes new estimators for discrete optimal transport plans that enjoy Gaussian limits centered at the true solution. This behavior stands in stark contrast with the performance of existing estimators, including those based on entropic regularization, which are asymptotically biased and only satisfy a CLT centered at a regularized version of the population-level plan. We develop a new regularization approach based on a different class of penalty functions, which can be viewed as the duals of those previously considered in the literature. The key feature of these penalty schemes it that they give rise to preliminary estimates that are asymptotically linear in the penalization strength. Our final estimator is obtained by constructing an appropriate linear combination of two penalized solutions corresponding to two different tuning parameters so that the bias introduced by the penalization cancels out. Unlike classical debiasing procedures, therefore, our proposal entirely avoids the delicate problem of estimating and then subtracting the estimated bias term. Our proofs, which apply beyond the case of optimal transport, are based on a novel asymptotic analysis of penalization schemes for linear programs. As a corollary of our results, we obtain the consistency of the naive bootstrap for fully data-driven inference on the true optimal solution. Simulation results and two data analyses support strongly the benefits of our approach relative to existing techniques.</p></details> |  |

We analyze ten years (2015--2024) of International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) standings, comprising five long-running superregional championships (Africa \& Arab, Asia East, Asia West, North America, and Northern Eurasia), associated local regionals of North America and Northern Eurasia, and the World Finals. For 366 World Finalist teams (2021--2024) we augment the dataset with pre-contest Codeforces ratings. Pairwise rank alignment is measured with Kendall's $\tau$. Overall, superregional ranks predict World Final ranks only moderately (weighted $\tau=0.407$), but regional-to-superregional consistency varies widely: Northern Eurasia exhibits the strongest alignment ($\tau=0.521$) while Asia West exhibits the weakest ($\tau=0.188$). Internal consistency within a region can exceed its predictive value for Worlds -- e.g., Northern Eurasia and North America regionals vs. superregionals ($\tau=0.666$ and $\tau=0.577$, respectively). Codeforces ratings correlate more strongly with World Final results ($\tau=0.596$) than any single ICPC tier, suggesting that high-frequency online contests capture decisive skill factors that many superregional sets miss. We argue that contest organizers can improve both fairness and pedagogical value by aligning problem style and selection rules with the formats that demonstrably differentiate teams, in particular the Northern-Eurasian model and well-curated online rounds. All data, scripts, and additional analyses are publicly released to facilitate replication and further study.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 9 tables, submitted for publication</p></details> |

Through a series of controlled experiments, we measure the validator's throughput and resource efficiency as RAM availability ranges between 128 GB to 1,536 GB (1.5 TB). We discover that the validator performance degrades significantly below 256 GB, with transaction processing falling behind real-time block production. Additionally, we study the program cache behavior, identifying inefficiencies in program eviction and load latency. Our results provide practical guidance for hardware provisioning and suggest improvements to the Solana execution and caching strategy, reducing latency due to the program cache by 90%.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

Task and motion planning (TAMP) addresses this by combining symbolic planning and continuous trajectory generation. Recently, foundation model approaches to TAMP have presented impressive results, including fast planning times and the execution of natural language instructions. Yet, the optimal interface between high-level planning and low-level motion generation remains an open question: prior approaches are limited by either too much abstraction (e.g., chaining simplified skill primitives) or a lack thereof (e.g., direct joint angle prediction). Our method introduces a novel technique employing a form of meta-optimization to address these issues by: (i) using program search over trajectory optimization problems as an interface between a foundation model and robot control, and (ii) leveraging a zero-order method to optimize numerical parameters in the foundation model output. Results on challenging object manipulation and drawing tasks confirm that our proposed method improves over prior TAMP approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 8 figures, under review for the 9th Annual Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2025)</p></details> |

The full model, including neural components, is discretized using a high-order implicit Runge-Kutta method with flipped Legendre-Gauss-Radau points, resulting in a large-scale nonlinear program (NLP) efficiently solved by state-of-the-art NLP solvers such as Ipopt. This formulation enables simultaneous optimization of network parameters and state trajectories, addressing key limitations of ODE solver-based training in terms of stability, runtime, and accuracy. Extending on a recent direct collocation-based method for Neural ODEs, we generalize to PeNODEs, incorporate physical constraints, and present a custom, parallelized, open-source implementation. Benchmarks on a Quarter Vehicle Model and a Van-der-Pol oscillator demonstrate superior accuracy, speed, and generalization with smaller networks compared to other training techniques. We also outline a planned integration into OpenModelica to enable accessible training of Neural DAEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, submitted to 16th International Modelica & FMI Conference</p></details> |

Since the development of high-fidelity proxy-apps, which exhibit similar performance characteristics as corresponding production applications, is labor-intensive, synthetic proxy-apps are created as a useful supplement to manually developed proxy-apps. To thoroughly resemble performance characteristics of HPC applications represented by Message Passing Interface (MPI) programs, we propose Siesta, a novel framework to automatically synthesize proxy-apps based on communication-computation traces. Given an MPI program, Siesta synthesizes parameterized code snippets to mimic computation behaviors in different execution periods, and combines the code snippets and MPI function records into an event trace. It then extracts program behavior patterns from the trace as grammars and finally transforms the grammars into a synthetic proxy-app. We evaluate the proposed methods on representative MPI programs with various environments. The results show that our synthetic proxy-apps can precisely approximate the performance characteristics of MPI programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Cluster 2024</p></details> |

Recently, several authors have developed core point methods for solving symmetric integer linear programs (ILPs). An integer point is called a core point if its orbit polytope is lattice-free. It has been shown that for symmetric ILPs, optimizing over the set of core points gives the same answer as considering the entire space. Existing core point techniques rely on the number of core points (or equivalence classes) being finite, which requires special symmetry groups. In this paper we develop some new methods for solving symmetric ILPs (based on outer approximations of core points) that do not depend on finiteness but are more efficient if the group has large disjoint cycles in its set of generators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update discussion of single vs. multiple element essential set.

Before the rise of LLM-based agents, a common strategy was to increase the number of generated patches, sometimes to the thousands, to achieve better repair results on benchmarks. More recently, self-iterative capabilities enabled LLMs to refine patches over multiple rounds guided by feedback. However, literature often focuses on many iterations and disregards different numbers of outputs. We investigate an APR pipeline that balances these two approaches, the generation of multiple outputs and multiple rounds of iteration, while imposing a limit of 10 total patches per bug. We apply three SOTA instruction-tuned LLMs - DeepSeekCoder-Instruct, Codellama-Instruct, Llama3.1-Instruct - to the APR task. We further fine-tune each model on an APR dataset with three sizes (1K, 30K, 65K) and two techniques (Full Fine-Tuning and LoRA), allowing us to assess their repair capabilities on two APR benchmarks: HumanEval-Java and Defects4J. Our results show that by using only a fraction (<1%) of the fine-tuning dataset, we can achieve improvements of up to 78% in the number of plausible patches generated, challenging prior studies that reported limited gains using Full Fine-Tuning. However, we find that exceeding certain thresholds leads to diminishing outcomes, likely due to overfitting. Moreover, we show that base models greatly benefit from creating patches in an iterative fashion rather than generating them all at once. In addition, the benefit of iterative strategies becomes more pronounced in complex benchmarks. Even fine-tuned models, while benefiting less from iterations, still gain advantages, particularly on complex benchmarks. The research underscores the need for balanced APR strategies that combine multi-output generation and iterative refinement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the research track of the 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE), 17-20 June 2025, Istanbul, T\"urkiye</p></details> |
| **[Smoothing of Headland Path Edges and Headland-to-Mainfield Lane Transitions Based on a Spatial Domain Transformation and Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05979v3)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within the context of in-field path planning and under the assumption of nonholonomic vehicle models this paper addresses two tasks: smoothing of headland path edges and smoothing of headland-to-mainfield lane transitions. Both tasks are solved by a two-step hierarchical algorithm. The first step differs for the two tasks generating either a piecewise-affine or a Dubins reference path. The second step leverages a transformation of vehicle dynamics from the time domain into the spatial domain and linear programming. Benefits such as a hyperparameter-free objective function and spatial constraints useful for area coverage gaps avoidance and precision path planning are discussed. The method, which is a deterministic optimisation-based method, is evaluated on 5 real-world fields solving 19 instances of the first task and 84 instances of the second task.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[RouthSearch: Inferring PID Parameter Specification for Flight Control Program by Coordinate Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02357v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Flight control programs use PID control modules with user-configurable Proportional (P), Integral (I), and Derivative (D) parameters to manage UAV flying behaviors. Users can adjust these PID parameters during flight. However, flight control programs lack sufficient safety checks on user-provided PID parameters, leading to a severe UAV vulnerability - the input validation bug. This occurs when a user misconfigures PID parameters, causing dangerous states like deviation from the expected path, loss of control, or crash. Prior works use random testing like fuzzing, but these are not effective in the three-dimensional search space of PID parameters. The expensive dynamic execution of UAV tests further hinders random testing performance. We address PID parameter misconfiguration by combining the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion with coordinate search, introducing RouthSearch. Instead of ad-hoc identification, RouthSearch principledly determines valid ranges for three-dimensional PID parameters. We first leverage the Routh-Hurwitz Criterion to identify a theoretical PID parameter boundary, then refine it using efficient coordinate search. The determined valid range can filter misconfigured PID parameters from users during flight and help discover logical bugs in flight control programs. We evaluated RouthSearch across eight flight modes in PX4 and Ardupilot. Results show RouthSearch determines valid ranges with 92.0% accuracy compared to ground truth. RouthSearch discovers 3,853 PID misconfigurations within 48 hours, while the STOA work PGFuzz discovers only 449 sets, significantly outperforming prior works by 8.58 times. Our method also helped detect three bugs in ArduPilot and PX4.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 34rd ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Conformal Predictive Programming for Chance Constrained Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07407v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose conformal predictive programming (CPP), a framework to solve chance constrained optimization problems, i.e., optimization problems with constraints that are functions of random variables. CPP utilizes samples from these random variables along with the quantile lemma - central to conformal prediction - to transform the chance constrained optimization problem into a deterministic problem with a quantile reformulation. CPP inherits a priori guarantees on constraint satisfaction from existing sample average approximation approaches for a class of chance constrained optimization problems, and it provides a posteriori guarantees that are of conditional and marginal nature otherwise. The strength of CPP is that it can easily support different variants of conformal prediction which have been (or will be) proposed within the conformal prediction community. To illustrate this, we present robust CPP to deal with distribution shifts in the random variables and Mondrian CPP to deal with class conditional chance constraints. To enable tractable solutions to the quantile reformulation, we present a mixed integer programming method (CPP-MIP) encoding, a bilevel optimization strategy (CPP-Bilevel), and a sampling-and-discarding optimization strategy (CPP-Discarding). We also extend CPP to deal with joint chance constrained optimization (JCCO). In a series of case studies, we show the validity of the aforementioned approaches, empirically compare CPP-MIP, CPP-Bilevel, as well as CPP-Discarding, and illustrate the advantage of CPP as compared to scenario approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-Driven Team Selection in Fantasy Premier League Using Integer Programming and Predictive Modeling Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02170v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fantasy football is a billion-dollar industry with millions of participants. Constrained by a fixed budget, decision-makers draft a squad whose players are expected to perform well in the upcoming weeks to maximize total points. This paper proposes novel deterministic and robust integer programming models that select the optimal starting eleven and the captain. A new hybrid scoring metric is constructed using an interpretable artificial intelligence framework and underlying match performance data. Several objective functions and estimation techniques are introduced for the programming model. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to approach fantasy football through this lens. The models' performance is evaluated using data from the 2023/24 Premier League season. Results indicate that the proposed hybrid method achieved the highest score while maintaining consistent performance. Utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation, the strategic choice of averaging techniques for estimating cost vectors, and the proposed hybrid approach are shown to be effective during the out-of-sample period. This paper also provides a thorough analysis of the optimal formations and players selected by the models, offering valuable insights into effective fantasy football strategies.</p></details> |  |
