With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability, and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world programming style.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We release all the experimental dataset and source code at: https://github.com/ignorancex/LLM_code</p></details> |
| **[Black-Box Adversarial Attacks on LLM-Based Code Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02509v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern code completion engines, powered by large language models (LLMs), assist millions of developers with their strong capabilities to generate functionally correct code. Due to this popularity, it is crucial to investigate the security implications of relying on LLM-based code completion. In this work, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art black-box LLM-based code completion engines can be stealthily biased by adversaries to significantly increase their rate of insecure code generation. We present the first attack, named INSEC, that achieves this goal. INSEC works by injecting an attack string as a short comment in the completion input. The attack string is crafted through a query-based optimization procedure starting from a set of carefully designed initialization schemes. We demonstrate INSEC's broad applicability and effectiveness by evaluating it on various state-of-the-art open-source models and black-box commercial services (e.g., OpenAI API and GitHub Copilot). On a diverse set of security-critical test cases, covering 16 CWEs across 5 programming languages, INSEC increases the rate of generated insecure code by more than 50%, while maintaining the functional correctness of generated code. We consider INSEC practical -- it requires low resources and costs less than 10 US dollars to develop on commodity hardware. Moreover, we showcase the attack's real-world deployability, by developing an IDE plug-in that stealthily injects INSEC into the GitHub Copilot extension.</p></details> |  |

We also determine the parity check matrices for these codes. Using the connection of MDS codes with arcs in finite projective spaces, we give a new characterization of o-monomials.</p></details> |  |
| **[GeoPandas-AI: A Smart Class Bringing LLM as Stateful AI Code Assistant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11781v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geospatial data analysis plays a crucial role in tackling intricate societal challenges such as urban planning and climate modeling. However, employing tools like GeoPandas, a prominent Python library for geospatial data manipulation, necessitates expertise in complex domain-specific syntax and workflows. GeoPandas-AI addresses this gap by integrating LLMs directly into the GeoPandas workflow, transforming the GeoDataFrame class into an intelligent, stateful class for both data analysis and geospatial code development. This paper formalizes the design of such a smart class and provides an open-source implementation of GeoPandas-AI in PyPI package manager. Through its innovative combination of conversational interfaces and stateful exploitation of LLMs for code generation and data analysis, GeoPandas-AI introduces a new paradigm for code-copilots and instantiates it for geospatial development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ACM SIGSPATIAL 2025</p></details> |
| **[The JPEG XL Image Coding System: History, Features, Coding Tools, Design Rationale, and Future](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05987v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>JPEG XL is a new image coding system offering state-of-the-art compression performance, lossless JPEG recompression, and advanced features. It aims to replace JPEG, PNG, GIF, and other formats with a single universal codec. This article provides an overview of JPEG XL, including its history, design rationale, coding tools, and future potential. It can be used as a companion document to the standard (ISO/IEC 18181), or as a standalone article to better understand JPEG XL, either at a high level or in considerable technical detail.</p></details> | 73 pages, 62 figures |
| **[KEENHash: Hashing Programs into Function-Aware Embeddings for Large-Scale Binary Code Similarity Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11612v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary code similarity analysis (BCSA) is a crucial research area in many fields such as cybersecurity. Specifically, function-level diffing tools are the most widely used in BCSA: they perform function matching one by one for evaluating the similarity between binary programs. However, such methods need a high time complexity, making them unscalable in large-scale scenarios (e.g., 1/n-to-n search). Towards effective and efficient program-level BCSA, we propose KEENHash, a novel hashing approach that hashes binaries into program-level representations through large language model (LLM)-generated function embeddings. KEENHash condenses a binary into one compact and fixed-length program embedding using K-Means and Feature Hashing, allowing us to do effective and efficient large-scale program-level BCSA, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that KEENHash is at least 215 times faster than the state-of-the-art function matching tools while maintaining effectiveness. Furthermore, in a large-scale scenario with 5.3 billion similarity evaluations, KEENHash takes only 395.83 seconds while these tools will cost at least 56 days. We also evaluate KEENHash on the program clone search of large-scale BCSA across extensive datasets in 202,305 binaries. Compared with 4 state-of-the-art methods, KEENHash outperforms all of them by at least 23.16%, and displays remarkable superiority over them in the large-scale BCSA security scenario of malware detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Code Review Comment Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11591v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code review comment generation (RCG) aims to assist developers by automatically producing natural language feedback for code changes. Existing approaches are primarily either generation-based, using pretrained language models, or information retrieval-based (IR), reusing comments from similar past examples. While generation-based methods leverage code-specific pretraining on large code-natural language corpora to learn semantic relationships between code and natural language, they often struggle to generate low-frequency but semantically important tokens due to their probabilistic nature. In contrast, IR-based methods excel at recovering such rare tokens by copying from existing examples but lack flexibility in adapting to new code contexts-for example, when input code contains identifiers or structures not found in the retrieval database. To bridge the gap between generation-based and IR-based methods, this work proposes to leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for RCG by conditioning pretrained language models on retrieved code-review exemplars. By providing relevant examples that illustrate how similar code has been previously reviewed, the model is better guided to generate accurate review comments. Our evaluation on the Tufano et al. benchmark shows that RAG-based RCG outperforms both generation-based and IR-based RCG. It achieves up to +1.67% higher exact match and +4.25% higher BLEU scores compared to generation-based RCG. It also improves the generation of low-frequency ground-truth tokens by up to 24.01%. We additionally find that performance improves as the number of retrieved exemplars increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Last-Pair Swapping Polar Codes: A Structure to Improve Polarization on Channels with Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11535v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A new structure of polar codes is proposed for channels with memory to improve polarization and approach the polarization efficiency of conventional polar codes on memoryless channels. We classify trellis channels, a particular type of finite state channels into two categories, called sub-injective trellis channels and non-sub-injective trellis channels, where an explicit polarization loss is observed on the former. For sub-injective trellis channels, we substitute the last kernel of each layer in polar coding structure by a swapping matrix, thus leading to our proposed coding structure named last-pair swapping structure. Simulation shows on sub-injective trellis channels polarization efficiency of the proposed polar code exceeds that of conventional one. Furthermore, we point out a special type of sub-injective trellis channels, called bijective trellis channels, and indicate on them the proposed structure achieves identical polarization efficiency with that of conventional one on memoryless channels, which is later theoretically proved. Moreover, limit of the proposed structure is also analyzed. Simulation results of error rate are given on continuous phase modulation (CPM) with additional white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, showing a considerable signal-to-noise power ratio (snr) gain of the proposed polar code over conventional one, and identical performances between the proposed polar code on bijective trellis channels and conventional one on memoryless channels.</p></details> | 23 pages, 15 figures |
| **[How Well Do Large Language Models Serve as End-to-End Secure Code Agents for Python?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10495v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 has revolutionized the landscape of software engineering, positioning these models at the core of modern development practices. As we anticipate these models to evolve into the primary and trustworthy tools used in software development, ensuring the security of the code they produce becomes paramount. How well can LLMs serve as end-to-end secure code producers? This paper presents a systematic investigation into LLMs' inherent potential to generate code with fewer vulnerabilities. Specifically, We studied GPT-3.5 and GPT-4's capability to identify and repair vulnerabilities in the code generated by four popular LLMs including themselves (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Code Llama, and CodeGeeX2). By manually or automatically reviewing 4,900 pieces of code, our study reveals that: (1) large language models lack awareness of scenario-relevant security risks, which leads to the generation of over 75% vulnerable code on the SecurityEval benchmark; (2) LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are unable to precisely identify vulnerabilities in the code they generated; (3) GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can achieve 33.2%~59.6% success rates in repairing the insecure code produced by the 4 LLMs, but they both perform poorly when repairing self-produced code, indicating self-repair "blind spots". To address the limitation of a single round of repair, we developed a lightweight tool that prompts LLMs to construct safer source code through an iterative repair procedure based on the insights gained from our study. Experiments show that assisted by semantic analysis engines, our tool significantly improves the success rates of repair to 65.9%~85.5%.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReVeal: Self-Evolving Code Agents via Iterative Generation-Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11442v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable outcome rewards have significantly improved the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), especially when combined with multi-turn tool interactions. However, existing methods lack both meaningful verification signals from realistic environments and explicit optimization for verification, leading to unreliable self-verification. To address these limitations, we propose ReVeal, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that interleaves code generation with explicit self-verification and tool-based evaluation. ReVeal enables LLMs to autonomously generate test cases, invoke external tools for precise feedback, and improves performance via a customized RL algorithm with dense, per-turn rewards. As a result, ReVeal fosters the co-evolution of a model's generation and verification capabilities through RL training, expanding the reasoning boundaries of the base model, demonstrated by significant gains in Pass@k on LiveCodeBench. It also enables test-time scaling into deeper inference regimes, with code consistently evolving as the number of turns increases during inference, ultimately surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B. These findings highlight the promise of ReVeal as a scalable and effective paradigm for building more robust and autonomous AI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[VeriLeaky: Navigating IP Protection vs Utility in Fine-Tuning for LLM-Driven Verilog Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13116v3)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for coding, yet fine-tuning (FT) with curated data is essential for niche languages like Verilog. Using proprietary intellectual property (IP) for FT presents a serious risk, as FT data can be leaked through LLM inference. This leads to a critical dilemma for design houses: seeking to build externally accessible LLMs offering competitive Verilog coding, how can they leverage in-house IP to enhance FT utility while ensuring IP protection? For the first time in the literature, we study this dilemma. Using LLaMA 3.1-8B, we conduct in-house FT on a baseline Verilog dataset (RTLCoder) supplemented with our own in-house IP, which is validated through multiple tape-outs. To rigorously assess IP leakage, we quantify structural similarity (AST/Dolos) and functional equivalence (Synopsys Formality) between generated codes and our in-house IP. We show that our IP can indeed be leaked, confirming the threat. As defense, we evaluate logic locking of Verilog codes (ASSURE). This offers some level of protection, yet reduces the IP's utility for FT and degrades the LLM's performance. Our study shows the need for novel strategies that are both effective and minimally disruptive to FT, an essential effort for enabling design houses to fully utilize their proprietary IP toward LLM-driven Verilog coding.</p></details> |  |
| **[The complete weight distribution of a family of irreducible cyclic codes of dimension two](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11349v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An important family of codes for data storage systems, cryptography, consumer electronics, and network coding for error control in digital communications are the so-called cyclic codes. This kind of linear codes are also important due to their efficient encoding and decoding algorithms. Because of this, cyclic codes have been studied for many years, however their complete weight distributions are known only for a few cases. The complete weight distribution has a wide range of applications in many research fields as the information it contains is of vital use in practical applications. Unfortunately, obtaining these distributions is in general a very hard problem that normally involves the evaluation of sophisticated exponential sums, which leaves this problem open for most of the cyclic codes. In this paper we determine, for any finite field $\bbbf_q$, the explicit factorization of any polynomial of the form $x^{q+1}-c$, where $c \in \bbbf_{q}^*$. Then we use this result to obtain, without the need to evaluate any kind of exponential sum, the complete weight distributions of a family of irreducible cyclic codes of dimension two over any finite field. As an application of our findings, we employ the complete weight distributions of some irreducible cyclic codes presented here to construct systematic authentication codes, showing that they are optimal or almost optimal.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we present a novel construction method for FDPC codes, introduce a generalization of these codes, and propose a low-complexity encoding algorithm. Numerical results demonstrate the fast convergence of the message-passing decoder for FDPC codes.</p></details> |  |

A Novel Hierarchical Feature Fusion Method for CoSAm: A Code-Switched Autism Corpus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14328v3)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neuro-developmental challenge, presenting a spectrum of difficulties in social interaction, communication, and the expression of repetitive behaviors in different situations. This increasing prevalence underscores the importance of ASD as a major public health concern and the need for comprehensive research initiatives to advance our understanding of the disorder and its early detection methods. This study introduces a novel hierarchical feature fusion method aimed at enhancing the early detection of ASD in children through the analysis of code-switched speech (English and Hindi). Employing advanced audio processing techniques, the research integrates acoustic, paralinguistic, and linguistic information using Transformer Encoders. This innovative fusion strategy is designed to improve classification robustness and accuracy, crucial for early and precise ASD identification. The methodology involves collecting a code-switched speech corpus, CoSAm, from children diagnosed with ASD and a matched control group. The dataset comprises 61 voice recordings from 30 children diagnosed with ASD and 31 from neurotypical children, aged between 3 and 13 years, resulting in a total of 159.75 minutes of voice recordings. The feature analysis focuses on MFCCs and extensive statistical attributes to capture speech pattern variability and complexity. The best model performance is achieved using a hierarchical fusion technique with an accuracy of 98.75% using a combination of acoustic and linguistic features first, followed by paralinguistic features in a hierarchical manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ar...</summary><p>We are withdrawing this paper as the current version requires substantial changes to the experimental design and analysis in Sections 4 and 5. These changes go beyond a minor revision, and there is no replacement version available at this time. A thoroughly revised version may be submitted as a new paper in the future</p></details> |
| **[LLM-as-a-Judge for Reference-less Automatic Code Validation and Refinement for Natural Language to Bash in IT Automation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11237v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an effort to automatically evaluate and select the best model and improve code quality for automatic incident remediation in IT Automation, it is crucial to verify if the generated code for remediation action is syntactically and semantically correct and whether it can be executed correctly as intended. There are three approaches: 1) conventional methods use surface form similarity metrics (token match, exact match, etc.) which have numerous limitations, 2) execution-based evaluation focuses more on code functionality based on pass/fail judgments for given test-cases, and 3) LLM-as-a-Judge employs LLMs for automated evaluation to judge if it is a correct answer for a given problem based on pre-defined metrics. In this work, we focused on enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge using bidirectional functionality matching and logic representation for reference-less automatic validation and refinement for Bash code generation to select the best model for automatic incident remediation in IT Automation. We used execution-based evaluation as ground-truth to evaluate our LLM-as-a-Judge metrics. Results show high accuracy and agreement with execution-based evaluation (and up to 8% over baseline). Finally, we built Reflection code agents to utilize judgments and feedback from our evaluation metrics which achieved significant improvement (up to 24% increase in accuracy) for automatic code refinement.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Execution Guided Line-by-Line Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10948v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel approach to neural code generation that incorporates real-time execution signals into the language model generation process. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation capabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during inference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our method, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically incorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing line-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable solutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search to sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract execution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and finally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By maintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and refreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance while preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports native parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in parallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad set of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks demonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance compared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across various levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging competitive programming tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/boazlavon/eg_cfg</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Large Language Models on Non-Code Software Engineering Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10833v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code understanding and generation; however, their effectiveness on non-code Software Engineering (SE) tasks remains underexplored. We present the first comprehensive benchmark, which we name `Software Engineering Language Understanding' (SELU), for evaluating LLMs on 17 non-code tasks, spanning from identifying whether a requirement is functional or non-functional to estimating the effort and complexity of backlog items. SELU covers classification, regression, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Masked Language Modeling (MLM) targets, with data drawn from diverse sources such as code repositories, issue tracking systems, and developer forums. We fine-tune 22 open-source LLMs, prompt two proprietary alternatives, and train two baselines. Performance is measured using metrics such as F1-macro, SMAPE, F1-micro, and accuracy, and compared via the Bayesian signed-rank test. Our results show that moderate-scale decoder-only models consistently form a top-tier, exhibiting high mean performance and low across-task variance, while domain adaptation via code-focused pre-training might yield only modest improvements. These insights guide model selection for non-code SE workflows and highlight directions for expanding SELU to generative and design-oriented scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Code Collapse: Reasoning Failures in LLMs via Adversarial Prompting in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06971v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in tasks requiring complex reasoning, such as code generation, mathematical problem solving, and algorithmic synthesis -- especially when aided by reasoning tokens and Chain-of-Thought prompting. Yet, a core question remains: do these models truly reason, or do they merely exploit shallow statistical patterns? In this paper, we introduce Chain-of-Code Collapse, where we systematically investigate the robustness of reasoning LLMs by introducing a suite of semantically faithful yet adversarially structured prompt perturbations. Our evaluation -- spanning 700 perturbed code generations derived from LeetCode-style problems -- applies transformations such as storytelling reframing, irrelevant constraint injection, example reordering, and numeric perturbation. We observe that while certain modifications severely degrade performance (with accuracy drops up to -42.1%), others surprisingly improve model accuracy by up to 35.3%, suggesting sensitivity not only to semantics but also to surface-level prompt dynamics. These findings expose the fragility and unpredictability of current reasoning systems, underscoring the need for more principles approaches to reasoning alignments and prompting robustness. We release our perturbation datasets and evaluation framework to promote further research in trustworthy and resilient LLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[VeriContaminated: Assessing LLM-Driven Verilog Coding for Data Contamination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13572v3)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized code generation, achieving exceptional results on various established benchmarking frameworks. However, concerns about data contamination - where benchmark data inadvertently leaks into pre-training or fine-tuning datasets - raise questions about the validity of these evaluations. While this issue is known, limiting the industrial adoption of LLM-driven software engineering, hardware coding has received little to no attention regarding these risks. For the first time, we analyze state-of-the-art (SOTA) evaluation frameworks for Verilog code generation (VerilogEval and RTLLM), using established methods for contamination detection (CCD and Min-K% Prob). We cover SOTA commercial and open-source LLMs (CodeGen2.5, Minitron 4b, Mistral 7b, phi-4 mini, LLaMA-{1,2,3.1}, GPT-{2,3.5,4o}, Deepseek-Coder, and CodeQwen 1.5), in baseline and fine-tuned models (RTLCoder and Verigen). Our study confirms that data contamination is a critical concern. We explore mitigations and the resulting trade-offs for code quality vs fairness (i.e., reducing contamination toward unbiased benchmarking).</p></details> |  |
| **[CoRT: Code-integrated Reasoning within Thinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09820v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown remarkable progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought (CoT), yet they remain inefficient or inaccurate when handling complex mathematical operations. Addressing these limitations through computational tools (e.g., computation libraries and symbolic solvers) is promising, but it introduces a technical challenge: Code Interpreter (CI) brings external knowledge beyond the model's internal text representations, thus the direct combination is not efficient. This paper introduces CoRT, a post-training framework for teaching LRMs to leverage CI effectively and efficiently. As a first step, we address the data scarcity issue by synthesizing code-integrated reasoning data through Hint-Engineering, which strategically inserts different hints at appropriate positions to optimize LRM-CI interaction. We manually create 30 high-quality samples, upon which we post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, with supervised fine-tuning, rejection fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Hint-Engineering models achieve 4\% and 8\% absolute improvements on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B respectively, across five challenging mathematical reasoning datasets. Furthermore, Hint-Engineering models use about 30\% fewer tokens for the 32B model and 50\% fewer tokens for the 1.5B model compared with the natural language models. The models and code are available at https://github.com/ChengpengLi1003/CoRT.</p></details> | work in progress |

While changed files are commonly presented in alphabetical order, this does not necessarily coincide with the reviewer's preferred navigation sequence. This study investigates the different navigation orders developers follow while commenting on changes submitted in pull requests. We mined code review comments from 23,241 pull requests in 100 popular Java and Python repositories on GitHub to analyze the order in which the reviewers commented on the submitted changes. Our analysis shows that for 44.6% of pull requests, the reviewers comment in a non-alphabetical order. Among these pull requests, we identified traces of alternative meaningful orders: 20.6% (2,134) followed a largest-diff-first order, 17.6% (1,827) were commented in the order of the files' similarity to the pull request's title and description, and 29% (1,188) of pull requests containing changes to both production and test files adhered to a test-first order. We also observed that the proportion of reviewed files to total submitted files was significantly higher in non-alphabetically ordered reviews, which also received slightly fewer approvals from reviewers, on average. Our findings highlight the need for additional support during code reviews, particularly for larger pull requests, where reviewers are more likely to adopt complex strategies rather than following a single predefined order.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Unsupervised Adaptation of a Speech Recogniser Using Entropy Minimisation and Speaker Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10653v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech recognisers usually perform optimally only in a specific environment and need to be adapted to work well in another. For adaptation to a new speaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that data is usually unlabelled. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to make adaptation to a single minute of data robust. First, instead of estimating the adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis or "pseudo-label", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional entropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation more robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a "speaker code" characterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data to estimate. On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the proposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning-Based Digitization of Overlapping ECG Images with Open-Source Python Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10617v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366, respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research and clinical applications.

| **[Downlink CSIT under Compressed Feedback: Joint vs. Separate Source-Channel Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10554v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The acquisition of Downlink (DL) channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is known to be a challenging task in multiuser massive MIMO systems when uplink/downlink channel reciprocity does not hold (e.g., in frequency division duplexing systems). From a coding viewpoint, the DL channel state acquired at the users via DL training can be seen as an information source that must be conveyed to the base station via the UL communication channels. The transmission of a source through a channel can be accomplished either by separate or joint source-channel coding (SSCC or JSCC). In this work, using classical remote distortion-rate (DR) theory, we first provide a theoretical lower bound on the channel estimation mean-square-error (MSE) of both JSCC and SSCC-based feedback schemes, which however requires encoding of large blocks of successive channel states and thus cannot be used in practicesince it would incur in an extremely large feedback delay. We then focus on the relevant case of minimal (one slot) feedback delay and propose a practical JSCC-based feedback scheme that fully exploits the channel second-order statistics to optimize the dimension projection in the eigenspace. We analyze the large SNR behavior of the proposed JSCC-based scheme in terms of the quality scaling exponent (QSE). Given the second-order statistics of channel estimation of any feedback scheme, we further derive the closed-form of the lower bound to the ergodic sum-rate for DL data transmission under maximum ratio transmission and zero-forcing precoding. Via extensive numerical results, we show that our proposed JSCC-based scheme outperforms known JSCC, SSCC baseline and deep learning-based schemes and is able to approach the performance of the optimal DR scheme in the range of practical SNR.</p></details> |  |

Dynamically selecting the optimal LLM based on task difficulty and resource constraints offers a promising approach to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. However, existing model selection methods are resource-intensive and often neglect cost efficiency. Moreover, these approaches rely on human-annotated difficulty labels that are frequently inaccessible in real-world settings and may not align with the LLM's own assessment of task difficulty. In this paper, we introduce AdaptiveLLM, a framework that dynamically selects optimal LLMs for a given coding task by automatically assessing task difficulty. Our framework first estimates task difficulty using Chain-of-Thought lengths generated by reasoning model, clusters these into three difficulty levels via k-means, and fine-tunes CodeBERT to embed difficulty-aware features. A trained XGBoost classifier then selects the best model for each problem, optimizing the performance-cost trade-off. Experimental results show that AdaptiveLLM achieves a 7.86% improvement in pass@1 score while reducing resource consumption by 88.9% compared to baseline method ComplexityNet. When compared to a single model, AdaptiveLLM demonstrates an approximately 15% accuracy improvement, while maintaining the same level of cost consumption. Apart from that, the difficulty assessment using CoT provides more reliable selection criteria than human evaluation. Our replication package is available at https://github.com/cjhCoder7/AdaptiveLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Internetware 2025</p></details> |

This paradigm has achieved significant success in face video compression. However, compared to facial videos, human body videos pose greater challenges due to their more complex and diverse motion patterns, i.e., when using explicit motion guidance for Generative Human Video Coding (GHVC), the reconstruction results could suffer severe distortions and inaccurate motion. As such, this paper highlights the limitations of explicit motion-based approaches for human body video compression and investigates the GHVC performance improvement with the aid of Implicit Motion Transformation, namely IMT. In particular, we propose to characterize complex human body signal into compact visual features and transform these features into implicit motion guidance for signal reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed IMT paradigm, which can facilitate GHVC to achieve high-efficiency compression and high-fidelity synthesis.</p></details> |  |

This study presents AutoGEEval++, an enhanced framework building on AutoGEEval, and the first automated assessment system for large language models (LLMs) generating geospatial code on Google Earth Engine (GEE). It supports diverse data modalities and varying task complexities. Built on the GEE Python API, AutoGEEval++ features a benchmark dataset-AutoGEEval++-Bench-with 6,365 test cases across 26 data types and three task categories: unit, combo, and theme tests. It includes a submission programme and a judge module to realise an end-to-end automated evaluation pipeline from code generation to execution-based validation. The framework adopts multi-dimensional metrics-accuracy, resource usage, run-time efficiency, and error types-balancing hallucination control and efficiency, and enabling boundary testing and error pattern analysis. Using AutoGEEval++, we evaluate 24 state-of-the-art LLMs (as of June 2025), including general-purpose, reasoning-enhanced, code-centric, and geoscience-specific models. Results reveal clear performance, stability, and error differences across task types, model designs, and deployment settings, confirming AutoGEEval++'s practical value and scalability in vertical-domain code generation. This work establishes the first standardised evaluation protocol and foundational benchmark for GEE-based LLM code generation, providing a unified basis for performance comparison and a methodological framework for systematic, domain-specific code evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoding for Punctured Convolutional and Turbo Codes: A Deep Learning Solution for Protocols Compliance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15475v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network-based decoding methods have shown promise in enhancing error correction performance, but traditional approaches struggle with the challenges posed by punctured codes. In particular, these methods fail to address the complexities of variable code rates and the need for protocol compatibility. This paper presents a unified Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based decoding architecture specifically designed to overcome these challenges. The proposed method unifies punctured convolutional and Turbo codes. A puncture embedding mechanism integrates puncturing patterns directly into the network, enabling seamless adaptation to varying code rates, while balanced bit error rate training ensures robustness across different code lengths, rates, and channels, maintaining protocol flexibility. Extensive simulations in Additive White Gaussian Noise and Rayleigh fading channels demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional decoding techniques, providing significant improvements in decoding accuracy and robustness. These results underscore the potential of LSTM-based decoding as a promising solution for next-generation artificial intelligence powered communication systems.</p></details> |  |

However, obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable, step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and overthinking.</p></details> |  |

A static code analysis framework detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and resource expenditure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FORGE 2025</p></details> |

The success of these optimizations primarily depends on the selection and ordering of the optimization passes applied to the code. While most compilers rely on a fixed sequence of optimization passes, current methods to find the optimal sequence either employ impractically slow search algorithms or learning methods that struggle to generalize to code unseen during training. We introduce CompilerDream, a model-based reinforcement learning approach to general code optimization. CompilerDream comprises a compiler world model that accurately simulates the intrinsic properties of optimization passes and an agent trained on this model to produce effective optimization strategies. By training on a large-scale program dataset, CompilerDream is equipped to serve as a general code optimizer across various application scenarios and source-code languages. Our extensive experiments first highlight CompilerDream's strong optimization capabilities for autotuning, where it leads the CompilerGym leaderboard. More importantly, the zero-shot generalization ability of large-scale trained compiler world model and agent, excels across diverse datasets, surpassing LLVM's built-in optimizations and other state-of-the-art methods in both settings of value prediction and end-to-end code optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2025 camera-ready version with extended appendix.

| **[Prompt Variability Effects On LLM Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10204v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation is one of the most active areas of application of Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs lower barriers to writing code and accelerate development process, the overall quality of generated programs depends on the quality of given prompts. Specifically, functionality and quality of generated code can be sensitive to user's background and familiarity with software development. It is therefore important to quantify LLM's sensitivity to variations in the input. To this end we propose a synthetic evaluation pipeline for code generation with LLMs, as well as a systematic persona-based evaluation approach to expose qualitative differences of LLM responses dependent on prospective user background. Both proposed methods are completely independent from specific programming tasks and LLMs, and thus are widely applicable. We provide experimental evidence illustrating utility of our methods and share our code for the benefit of the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-aware Berrut Approximated Coded Computing for Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01704v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) is an interesting strategy that enables the collaborative training of an AI model among different data owners without revealing their private datasets. Even so, FL has some privacy vulnerabilities that have been tried to be overcome by applying some techniques like Differential Privacy (DP), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), or Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). However, these techniques have some important drawbacks that might narrow their range of application: problems to work with non-linear functions and to operate large matrix multiplications and high communication and computational costs to manage semi-honest nodes. In this context, we propose a solution to guarantee privacy in FL schemes that simultaneously solves the previously mentioned problems. Our proposal is based on the Berrut Approximated Coded Computing, a technique from the Coded Distributed Computing paradigm, adapted to a Secret Sharing configuration, to provide input privacy to FL in a scalable way. It can be applied for computing non-linear functions and treats the special case of distributed matrix multiplication, a key primitive at the core of many automated learning tasks. Because of these characteristics, it could be applied in a wide range of FL scenarios, since it is independent of the machine learning models or aggregation algorithms used in the FL scheme. We provide analysis of the achieved privacy and complexity of our solution and, due to the extensive numerical results performed, a good trade-off between privacy and precision can be observed.</p></details> |  |

Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec) trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety; labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate communications to address pertinent HC questions.

Yet, despite recent advances, their output often suffers from syntactic and semantic errors and remains difficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs), researchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output. Nevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals significant limitations, such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation. In this paper, we present D-LiFT, an automated decompiler backend that harnesses and further trains LLMs to improve the quality of decompiled code via reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving accuracy, D-LiFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of decompiled code: \textit{preserving accuracy while improving readability}. Central to D-LiFT, we propose D-SCORE, an integrated quality assessment system to score the decompiled code from multiple aspects. In line with our principle, D-SCORE assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher scores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Specifically, D-SCORE first verifies the syntactic and semantic correctness via the compiler and symbolic execution; only if a candidate is deemed accurate, it then evaluates readability using established metrics to compare the LLM output with the original decompiled code. The score will then be fed back to the LLM for fine-tuning. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs, demonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without D-SCORE-driven fine-tuning, D-LiFT produces 55.3% more improved decompiled functions, as measured by D-SCORE.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiKO: A Hierarchical Framework for Beyond-Second-Order KO Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10121v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces HiKO (Hierarchical Kronecker Operation), a novel framework for training high-rate neural error-correcting codes that enables KO codes to outperform Reed-Muller codes beyond second order. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to extend KO codes beyond second order. While conventional KO codes show promising results for low-rate regimes ($r < 2$), they degrade at higher rates -- a critical limitation for practical deployment. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) a hierarchical training methodology that decomposes complex high-rate codes into simpler constituent codes for efficient knowledge transfer, (2) enhanced neural architectures with dropout regularization and learnable skip connections tailored for the Plotkin structure, and (3) a progressive unfreezing strategy that systematically transitions from pre-trained components to fully optimized integrated codes. Our experiments show that HiKO codes consistently outperform traditional Reed-Muller codes across various configurations, achieving notable performance improvements for third-order ($r = 3$) and fourth-order ($r = 4$) codes. Analysis reveals that HiKO codes successfully approximate Shannon-optimal Gaussian codebooks while preserving efficient decoding properties. This represents the first successful extension of KO codes beyond second order, opening new possibilities for neural code deployment in high-throughput communication systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChartReasoner: Code-Driven Modality Bridging for Long-Chain Reasoning in Chart Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10116v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities through long-chain reasoning before responding. However, how to extend this capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations, especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Models Enable Scalable Code Verification by Trading Accuracy for Throughput](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10056v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The standard paradigm for solving coding tasks via large language models (LLMs) is to generate-then-rank programs, where the latter step uses a verifier in the ranking process. The growing consensus is that a comprehensive verifier (e.g., a full test suite) should be prioritized over an outcome reward model (ORM) whenever possible, with little consideration given to the trade-offs involved. We aim to challenge this assumption by systematically exploring the tradeoff between speed and accuracy. We find that ORMs play a crucial role in scaling verification through trading accuracy for speed, even when a comprehensive verifier is available. Their value becomes especially apparent when used in a generate-prune-then-rank approach, where a faster but less accurate verifier removes incorrect solutions prior to ranking -- leading to a system that is 11.65x faster while only being 8.33% less accurate than the full test suite. We analyze the generate-prune-then-rank approach and show that it works by filtering out incorrect but highly ranked solutions. These findings enable the design of scalable and accurate program ranking systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 6 figures, code released here: https://github.com/SprocketLab/orm-code-verifier</p></details> |

The spiking neural networks (SNNs) with low-power consumption characteristics can provide a novel solution for this research. Therefore, we apply SNNs to monocular 3D object detection and propose the SpikeSMOKE architecture in this paper, which is a new attempt for low-power monocular 3D object detection. As we all know, discrete signals of SNNs will generate information loss and limit their feature expression ability compared with the artificial neural networks (ANNs).In order to address this issue, inspired by the filtering mechanism of biological neuronal synapses, we propose a cross-scale gated coding mechanism(CSGC), which can enhance feature representation by combining cross-scale fusion of attentional methods and gated filtering mechanisms.In addition, to reduce the computation and increase the speed of training, we present a novel light-weight residual block that can maintain spiking computing paradigm and the highest possible detection performance. Compared to the baseline SpikeSMOKE under the 3D Object Detection, the proposed SpikeSMOKE with CSGC can achieve 11.78 (+2.82, Easy), 10.69 (+3.2, Moderate), and 10.48 (+3.17, Hard) on the KITTI autonomous driving dataset by AP|R11 at 0.7 IoU threshold, respectively. It is important to note that the results of SpikeSMOKE can significantly reduce energy consumption compared to the results on SMOKE. For example,the energy consumption can be reduced by 72.2% on the hard category, while the detection performance is reduced by only 4%. SpikeSMOKE-L (lightweight) can further reduce the amount of parameters by 3 times and computation by 10 times compared to SMOKE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mutual-Supervised Learning for Sequential-to-Parallel Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11153v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of GPU-based high-performance computing (HPC) has driven the widespread adoption of parallel programming models such as CUDA. Yet, the inherent complexity of parallel programming creates a demand for the automated sequential-to-parallel approaches. However, data scarcity poses a significant challenge for machine learning-based sequential-to-parallel code translation. Although recent back-translation methods show promise, they still fail to ensure functional equivalence in the translated code. In this paper, we propose a novel Mutual-Supervised Learning (MSL) framework for sequential-to-parallel code translation to address the functional equivalence issue. MSL consists of two models, a Translator and a Tester. Through an iterative loop consisting of Co-verify and Co-evolve steps, the Translator and the Tester mutually generate data for each other and improve collectively. The Tester generates unit tests to verify and filter functionally equivalent translated code, thereby evolving the Translator, while the Translator generates translated code as augmented input to evolve the Tester. Experimental results demonstrate that MuSL significantly enhances the performance of the base model: when applied to Qwen2.5-Coder, it not only improves Pass@1 by up to 28.91% and boosts Tester performance by 68.90%, but also outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method CodeRosetta by 1.56 and 6.92 in BLEU and CodeBLEU scores, while achieving performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1.

Furthermore, basing on the properties of finite fields, we construct a class of optimal ternary cyclic codes with respect to the Sphere Packing Bound, and show that these codes are not equivalent to any known codes.</p></details> | 17 pages |

Inspired by the human process of second language acquisition, particularly code-switching$\unicode{x2014}$the practice of language alternation in a conversation$\unicode{x2014}$we propose code-switching curriculum learning (CSCL) to enhance cross-lingual transfer for LLMs. CSCL mimics the stages of human language learning by progressively training models with a curriculum consisting of 1) token-level code-switching, 2) sentence-level code-switching, and 3) monolingual corpora. Using Qwen 2 as our underlying model, we demonstrate the efficacy of the CSCL in improving language transfer to Korean, achieving significant performance gains compared to monolingual continual pre-training methods. Ablation studies reveal that both token- and sentence-level code-switching significantly enhance cross-lingual transfer and that curriculum learning amplifies these effects. We also extend our findings into various languages, including Japanese (high-resource) and Indonesian (low-resource), and using two additional models (Gemma 2 and Phi 3.5). We further show that CSCL mitigates spurious correlations between language resources and safety alignment, presenting a robust, efficient framework for more equitable language transfer in LLMs. We observe that CSCL is effective for low-resource settings where high-quality, monolingual corpora for language transfer are hardly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Findings of ACL 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we discover that code-switching in red-teaming queries can effectively elicit undesirable behaviors of LLMs, which are common practices in natural language. We introduce a simple yet effective framework, CSRT, to synthesize codeswitching red-teaming queries and investigate the safety and multilingual understanding of LLMs comprehensively. Through extensive experiments with ten state-of-the-art LLMs and code-switching queries combining up to 10 languages, we demonstrate that the CSRT significantly outperforms existing multilingual red-teaming techniques, achieving 46.7% more attacks than standard attacks in English and being effective in conventional safety domains. We also examine the multilingual ability of those LLMs to generate and understand codeswitching texts. Additionally, we validate the extensibility of the CSRT by generating codeswitching attack prompts with monolingual data. We finally conduct detailed ablation studies exploring code-switching and propound unintended correlation between resource availability of languages and safety alignment in existing multilingual LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in ACL 2025</p></details> |

Rather than being an incidental byproduct of prompting, we argue that the trade-off between rapid, direct answers ("fast thinking") and elaborate, chain-of-thought deliberation ("slow thinking") must be explicitly managed. We contend that optimizing reasoning budgets across the entire model lifecycle - from synthetic data creation and benchmarking to real-world deploymen - can unlock superior trade-offs among accuracy, latency, and cost. This paper outlines how adaptive control over reasoning can enrich supervision signals, motivate new multi-dimensional benchmarks, and inform cost-aware, security-conscious deployment policies. By viewing fast and slow thinking as complementary modes to be scheduled, we envision coding agents that think deep when necessary and act fast when possible.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Better Code Generation: Adaptive Decoding with Uncertainty Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08980v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation using large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to the choice of tokens during decoding, especially at points of uncertainty that critically affect the generated program's logic. Conventional decoding methods such as greedy search and beam search apply uniform treatment to all tokens, neglecting the unique uncertainty characteristics inherent in code generation, which can result in suboptimal outputs. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis demonstrating that a significant portion of generation errors arises from incorrect token ranking at high-uncertainty steps, where the ground truth token exists in the candidate set but fails to be ranked first. Inspired by this insight, we introduce AdaDec, an adaptive decoding framework guided by token-level uncertainty quantified via Shannon entropy. AdaDec dynamically learns uncertainty thresholds tailored to each model and employs a pause-then-rerank mechanism with lookahead when the uncertainty surpasses these thresholds. Evaluation on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks reveals that AdaDec achieves up to a 15.5% improvement in Pass@1 accuracy compared to greedy decoding, matches or outperforms traditional beam search, and reduces both computational overhead and latency through targeted, selective pausing. Our findings suggest that uncertainty-aware adaptive decoding holds considerable potential for enhancing both the reliability and efficiency of code generation with LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Less is More: DocString Compression in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.22793v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread use of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering has intensified the need for improved model and resource efficiency. In particular, for neural code generation, LLMs are used to translate function/method signature and DocString to executable code. DocStrings which capture user re quirements for the code and used as the prompt for LLMs, often contains redundant information. Recent advancements in prompt compression have shown promising results in Natural Language Processing (NLP), but their applicability to code generation remains uncertain. Our empirical study show that the state-of-the-art prompt compression methods achieve only about 10% reduction, as further reductions would cause significant performance degradation. In our study, we propose a novel compression method, ShortenDoc, dedicated to DocString compression for code generation. Our extensive experiments on six code generation datasets, five open-source LLMs (1B to 10B parameters), and one closed-source LLM GPT-4o confirm that ShortenDoc achieves 25-40% compression while preserving the quality of generated code, outperforming other baseline methods at similar compression levels. The benefit of this research is to improve efficiency and reduce the cost while maintaining the quality of the generated code, especially when calling third-party APIs, and is able to reduce the token processing cost by 25-40%.</p></details> | TOSEM |
| **[Enhancing Code LLMs with Reinforcement Learning in Code Generation: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20367v4)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for enhancing large language models (LLMs) in code generation and optimization. This survey systematically reviews RL-driven techniques across the code development lifecycle, from compiler-level optimizations and resource allocation strategies to end-to-end code synthesis frameworks. We first examine classical and modern RL algorithms -- spanning policy gradients, actor-critic methods, human-feedback alignment, and preference-based optimization -- and their adaptations to the unique challenges of code generation, such as sparse and delayed rewards. Next, we analyze key benchmarks, datasets, and evaluation metrics that drive progress in RL-augmented Code LLMs. Finally, we identify open problems, including the need for richer feedback sources, support for low-level and domain-specific languages, and methods to reduce computational overhead. By consolidating current insights and outlining future directions, this work aims to guide researchers and practitioners in leveraging RL to produce more robust, efficient, and human-aligned code generation systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code Vulnerability Repair with Large Language Model using Context-Aware Prompt Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18395v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown significant challenges in detecting and repairing vulnerable code, particularly when dealing with vulnerabilities involving multiple aspects, such as variables, code flows, and code structures. In this study, we utilize GitHub Copilot as the LLM and focus on buffer overflow vulnerabilities. Our experiments reveal a notable gap in Copilot's abilities when dealing with buffer overflow vulnerabilities, with a 76% vulnerability detection rate but only a 15% vulnerability repair rate. To address this issue, we propose context-aware prompt tuning techniques designed to enhance LLM performance in repairing buffer overflow. By injecting a sequence of domain knowledge about the vulnerability, including various security and code contexts, we demonstrate that Copilot's successful repair rate increases to 63%, representing more than four times the improvement compared to repairs without domain knowledge.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a class of binary linear codes that generalizes the RM family by replacing the domain $\mathbb{Z}_2^m$ with an arbitrary finite Coxeter group. Like RM codes, this class is closed under duality, forms a nested code sequence, satisfies a multiplication property, and has asymptotic rate determined by a Gaussian distribution.

With this widespread penetration, the carbon emissions of software are rapidly growing as well, thereby negatively impacting the long-term sustainability of our environment. Hence, optimizing software from a sustainability standpoint becomes more crucial than ever. We believe that the adoption of automated tools that can identify energy-inefficient patterns in the code and guide appropriate refactoring can significantly assist in this optimization. In this extended abstract, we present an industry case study that evaluates the sustainability impact of refactoring energy-inefficient code patterns identified by automated software sustainability assessment tools for a large application. Preliminary results highlight a positive impact on the application's sustainability post-refactoring, leading to a 29% decrease in per-user per-month energy consumption.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 pag...</summary><p>3 pages.

| **[On The Impact of Merge Request Deviations on Code Review Practices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08860v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is a key practice in software engineering, ensuring quality and collaboration. However, industrial Merge Request (MR) workflows often deviate from standardized review processes, with many MRs serving non-review purposes (e.g., drafts, rebases, or dependency updates). We term these cases deviations and hypothesize that ignoring them biases analytics and undermines ML models for review analysis. We identify seven deviation categories, occurring in 37.02% of MRs, and propose a few-shot learning detection method (91% accuracy). By excluding deviations, ML models predicting review completion time improve performance in 53.33% of cases (up to 2.25x) and exhibit significant shifts in feature importance (47% overall, 60% top-*k*). Our contributions include: (1) a taxonomy of MR deviations, (2) an AI-driven detection approach, and (3) empirical evidence of their impact on ML-based review analytics. This work aids practitioners in optimizing review efforts and ensuring reliable insights.</p></details> |  |
| **[UTBoost: Rigorous Evaluation of Coding Agents on SWE-Bench](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09289v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has spurred the development of coding agents for real-world code generation. As a widely used benchmark for evaluating the code generation capabilities of these agents, SWE-Bench uses real-world problems based on GitHub issues and their corresponding pull requests. However, the manually written test cases included in these pull requests are often insufficient, allowing generated patches to pass the tests without resolving the underlying issue. To address this challenge, we introduce UTGenerator, an LLM-driven test case generator that automatically analyzes codebases and dependencies to generate test cases for real-world Python projects. Building on UTGenerator, we propose UTBoost, a comprehensive framework for test case augmentation. In our evaluation, we identified 36 task instances with insufficient test cases and uncovered 345 erroneous patches incorrectly labeled as passed in the original SWE Bench. These corrections, impacting 40.9% of SWE-Bench Lite and 24.4% of SWE-Bench Verified leaderboard entries, yield 18 and 11 ranking changes, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[RocketPPA: Code-Level Power, Performance, and Area Prediction via LLM and Mixture of Experts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21971v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents RocketPPA, a novel ultra-fast power, performance (delay), and area (PPA) estimator operating directly at the code-level abstraction using HDL code as input. The key technical innovation is its LLM-based regression model, which uniquely integrates a large language model (LLM) with a mixture-of-experts (MoE) architecture composed of multilayer perceptrons (MLPs). The LLM interprets the input HDL code and then utilizes its final hidden-layer representations to predict PPA metrics. Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) is used for parameter-efficient fine-tuning to enable efficient LLM training. Furthermore, the work includes the development of an LLM-based HDL code repair framework to generate a large and synthesizable training dataset. Experimental results on the VerilogEval benchmark demonstrate that RocketPPA achieves significant improvements in the accuracy of PPA estimation compared to previous state-of-the-art methods like Llama3-MetRex-8B. Specifically, at a 10% relative error threshold, RocketPPA enhances the pass rate for area prediction by 13.6%, delay by 9.4%, and power by 14.7%. At a 20% threshold, the improvements are 9.6% for area, 10.8% for delay, and 18.5% for power. Moreover, RocketPPA achieves a speedup of over 20x compared to MetRex and 30x over MasterRTL in processing the test set. The impact of RocketPPA is the potential to substantially accelerate the hardware design process by providing accurate PPA estimations early in the design cycle, thus avoiding the overhead of manual feature engineering and time-consuming synthesis flows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rejection-Sampled Linear Codes for Lossy Compression and Channel Simulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09239v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that a linear code combined with rejection sampling can give a capacity-achieving scheme for simulating channels with additive noises with exchangeable distributions. Hence, it can be used in lossy source coding to achieve the rate-distortion function. Interestingly, unlike conventional linear covering codes for lossy compression which concerns the trade-off between the rate and the covering radius, our construction only requires the linear code to have a large distance (not a large covering radius), and is not sensitive to the rate of the linear code. Experiments reveal that our construction can outperform conventional covering codes for lossy source coding with Hamming distortion for a certain range of distortion levels, and performs well even when the blocklength is small (e.g., 24).</p></details> | 12 pages, 5 figures |

While LLMs excel at producing documentation from code alone, we hypothesize that incorporating formally verified invariants yields more complete and accurate results. We present a systematic comparison of documentation generated from JML-annotated and non-annotated Java classes, evaluating quality through both automated metrics and expert analysis. Our findings demonstrate that JML significantly improves class-level documentation completeness, with more moderate gains at the method level. Formal specifications prove particularly effective in capturing complex class invariants and design contracts that are frequently overlooked in code-only documentation. A threshold effect emerges, where the benefits of JML become more pronounced for classes with richer sets of invariants. While JML enhances specification coverage, its impact on core descriptive quality is limited, suggesting that formal specifications primarily ensure comprehensive coverage rather than fundamentally altering implementation descriptions. These results offer actionable insights for software teams adopting formal methods in documentation workflows, highlighting scenarios where JML provides clear advantages. The study contributes to AI-assisted software documentation research by demonstrating how formal methods and LLMs can synergistically improve documentation quality.</p></details> |  |

A distributed storage system uses a linear code to encode a large file across several nodes. If one of the nodes fails, a linear exact repair scheme efficiently recovers the failed node by accessing and downloading data from the rest of the servers of the storage system. In this article, we develop a linear repair scheme for free maximum distance separable codes, which coincide with free maximum distance with respect to the rank codes over Galois rings. In particular, we give a linear repair scheme for full-length Reed-Solomon codes over a Galois ring.</p></details> |  |

Global diffusion and impact of generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08945v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative coding tools promise big productivity gains, but uneven uptake could widen skill and income gaps. We train a neural classifier to spot AI-generated Python functions in 80 million GitHub commits (2018-2024) by 200,000 developers and track how fast--and where--these tools take hold. By December 2024, AI wrote an estimated 30.1% of Python functions from U.S. contributors, versus 24.3% in Germany, 23.2% in France, 21.6% in India, 15.4% in Russia and 11.7% in China. Newer GitHub users use AI more than veterans, while male and female developers adopt at similar rates. Within-developer fixed-effects models show that moving to 30% AI use raises quarterly commits by 2.4%. Coupling this effect with occupational task and wage data puts the annual value of AI-assisted coding in the United States at $9.6-$14.4 billion, rising to $64-$96 billion if we assume higher estimates of productivity effects reported by randomized control trials. Moreover, generative AI prompts learning and innovation, leading to increases in the number of new libraries and library combinations that programmers use. In short, AI usage is already widespread but highly uneven, and the intensity of use, not only access, drives measurable gains in output and exploration.</p></details> | 42 pages |

This work introduces a novel method to improve inference in discrete Variational Autoencoders by reframing the inference problem through a generative perspective. We conceptualize the model as a communication system, and propose to leverage Error-Correcting Codes (ECCs) to introduce redundancy in latent representations, allowing the variational posterior to produce more accurate estimates and reduce the variational gap. We present a proof-of-concept using a Discrete Variational Autoencoder with binary latent variables and low-complexity repetition codes, extending it to a hierarchical structure for disentangling global and local data features. Our approach significantly improves generation quality, data reconstruction, and uncertainty calibration, outperforming the uncoded models even when trained with tighter bounds such as the Importance Weighted Autoencoder objective. We also outline the properties that ECCs should possess to be effectively utilized for improved discrete variational inference.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at UAI 2025 Conference</p></details> |

The sustainability or "greenness" of software is typically determined by the adoption of sustainable coding practices. With a maturing ecosystem around generative AI, many software developers now rely on these tools to generate code using natural language prompts. Despite their potential advantages, there is a significant lack of studies on the sustainability aspects of AI-generated code. Specifically, how environmentally friendly is the AI-generated code based upon its adoption of sustainable coding practices? In this paper, we present the results of an early investigation into the sustainability aspects of AI-generated code across three popular generative AI tools - ChatGPT, BARD, and Copilot. The results highlight the default non-green behavior of tools for generating code, across multiple rules and scenarios. It underscores the need for further in-depth investigations and effective remediation strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages.

Existing detection methods, relying on heuristics or Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) techniques, often face limitations such as unsatisfactory performance. Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods have emerged as a resource-efficient approach for adapting LLMs to specific tasks, but their effectiveness for code smell detection remains underexplored. In this regard, this study evaluates state-of-the-art PEFT methods on both Small (SLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) for detecting four types of code smells: Complex Conditional, Complex Method, Feature Envy, and Data Class. Using high-quality and balanced datasets sourced from GitHub, we fine-tuned four SLMs and five LLMs with PEFT techniques, including prompt tuning, prefix tuning, LoRA, and (IA)3. Results show that PEFT methods achieve comparable or better performance than full fine-tuning while consuming less GPU memory. LLMs generally outperform SLMs on detecting certain smells (e.g., Complex Conditional), while SLMs do better on others (e.g., Data Class). Additionally, increasing training dataset size significantly boosted performance, while increasing trainable parameters did not. Our findings highlight PEFT methods as effective and scalable solutions, outperforming existing heuristic-based, DL-based, and In-Context Learning approaches for code smell detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 7 images, 11 tables, Manuscript revision submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |

This work investigates the viability of leveraging large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization by fine-tuning a parameter-efficient version of Code Llama using LoRA. The adapted LLM is capable of generating accurate and efficient hyperparameter recommendations tailored to diverse neural network architectures. Unlike traditional approaches such as Optuna, which rely on computationally intensive trial-and-error procedures, our method achieves competitive or superior results in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our findings demonstrate that LLM-based optimization not only matches the performance of state-of-the-art techniques like Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) but also substantially accelerates the tuning process. This positions LLMs as a promising alternative for rapid experimentation, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and mobile platforms, where computational efficiency is essential. In addition to improved efficiency, the method offers time savings and consistent performance across various tasks, highlighting its robustness and generalizability. All generated hyperparameters are included in the LEMUR Neural Network (NN) Dataset, which is publicly available and serves as an open-source benchmark for hyperparameter optimization research.</p></details> |  |

We extend the scope of RM codes development and analysis to multiple-access channels (MACs) and quantum Pauli channels, leveraging a unified approach. Specifically, we first derive the achievable rate region for RM codes on so-called Q-MACs, a class of MACs with additive correlated noise. This is achieved via a generalization of the bending and boosting arguments defined in arXiv:2304.02509. We then put forward a connection between the rate region of these QMACs and quantum RM codes designed for Pauli noise channels. This connection highlights a universality property of quantum RM codes, demonstrating their rate-optimal performance across a range of channel parameters, rather than for a single Pauli channel.</p></details> |  |

This extraneous generation suggests a lack of awareness regarding output boundaries, requiring truncation for effective evaluation. The determination of an optimal truncation strategy, however, often proves intricate, particularly when the scope includes several programming languages. This study investigates the necessity of post-processing instruction-tuned LLM outputs. Our findings reveal that supervised fine-tuning significantly enhances FIM code generation, enabling LLMs to generate code that seamlessly integrates with the surrounding context. Evaluating our fine-tuned \texttt{Qwen2.5-Coder} (base and instruct) models on HumanEval Infilling and SAFIM benchmarks demonstrates improved performances without post-processing, especially when the \emph{middle} consist of complete lines. However, post-processing of the LLM outputs remains necessary when the \emph{middle} is a random span of code.</p></details> | Work in progress |
| **[Adversarial Attack Classification and Robustness Testing for Large Language Models for Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07942v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become vital tools in software development tasks such as code generation, completion, and analysis. As their integration into workflows deepens, ensuring robustness against vulnerabilities especially those triggered by diverse or adversarial inputs becomes increasingly important. Such vulnerabilities may lead to incorrect or insecure code generation when models encounter perturbed task descriptions, code, or comments. Prior research often overlooks the role of natural language in guiding code tasks. This study investigates how adversarial perturbations in natural language inputs including prompts, comments, and descriptions affect LLMs for Code (LLM4Code). It examines the effects of perturbations at the character, word, and sentence levels to identify the most impactful vulnerabilities. We analyzed multiple projects (e.g., ReCode, OpenAttack) and datasets (e.g., HumanEval, MBPP), establishing a taxonomy of adversarial attacks. The first dimension classifies the input type code, prompts, or comments while the second dimension focuses on granularity: character, word, or sentence-level changes. We adopted a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative performance metrics with qualitative vulnerability analysis. LLM4Code models show varying robustness across perturbation types. Sentence-level attacks were least effective, suggesting models are resilient to broader contextual changes. In contrast, word-level perturbations posed serious challenges, exposing semantic vulnerabilities. Character-level effects varied, showing model sensitivity to subtle syntactic deviations.Our study offers a structured framework for testing LLM4Code robustness and emphasizes the critical role of natural language in adversarial evaluation. Improving model resilience to semantic-level disruptions is essential for secure and reliable code-generation systems.</p></details> |  |

Considering that the model requires a confluence of multidimensional sub-capabilities to address the challenges of various development phases, constructing a multi-view evaluation framework is crucial for accurately guiding the enhancement of development efficiency. However, existing benchmarks usually fail to provide an assessment of sub-capabilities and focus solely on webpage generation outcomes. In this work, we draw inspiration from the principles of software engineering and further propose WebUIBench, a benchmark systematically designed to evaluate MLLMs in four key areas: WebUI Perception, HTML Programming,WebUI-HTML Understanding, and WebUI-to-Code. WebUIBench comprises 21K high-quality question-answer pairs derived from over 0.7K real-world websites. The extensive evaluation of 29 mainstream MLLMs uncovers the skill characteristics and various weakness that models encountered during the development process.</p></details> |  |
| **[A General Coding Framework for Adaptive Private Information Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07787v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of $T$-colluding private information retrieval (PIR) enables the user to retrieve one out of $M$ files from a distributed storage system with $N$ servers without revealing anything about the index of the desired file to any group of up to $T$ colluding servers. In the considered storage system, the $M$ files are stored across the $N$ distributed servers in an $X$-secure $K$-coded manner such that any group of up to $X$ colluding servers learns nothing about the files; the storage overhead at each server is reduced by a factor of $\frac{1}{K}$ compared to the total size of the files; and the files can be reconstructed from any $K+X$ servers. However, in practical scenarios, when the user retrieves the desired file from the distributed system, some servers may respond to the user very slowly or not respond at all. These servers are referred to as \emph{stragglers}, and particularly their identities and numbers are unknown in advance and may change over time. This paper considers the adaptive PIR problem that can be capable of tolerating the presence of a varying number of stragglers. We propose a general coding method for designing adaptive PIR schemes by introducing the concept of a \emph{feasible PIR coding framework}. We demonstrate that any \emph{feasible PIR coding framework} over a finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with size $q$ can be used to construct an adaptive PIR scheme that achieves a retrieval rate of $1-\frac{K+X+T-1}{N-S}$ simultaneously for all numbers of stragglers $0\leq S\leq N-(K+X+T)$ over the same finite field. Additionally, we provide an implementation of the \emph{feasible PIR coding framework}, ensuring that the adaptive PIR scheme operates over any finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$ with size $q\geq N+\max\{K, N-(K+X+T-1)\}$.</p></details> | Accepted by IEEE TIT |

However, most existing neural B-frame codecs directly adopt P-frame coding tools without adequately addressing the unique challenges of B-frame compression, leading to suboptimal performance. To bridge this gap, we propose novel enhancements for motion compression and temporal fusion for neural B-frame coding. First, we design a fine-grained motion compression method. This method incorporates an interactive dual-branch motion auto-encoder with per-branch adaptive quantization steps, which enables fine-grained compression of bi-directional motion vectors while accommodating their asymmetric bitrate allocation and reconstruction quality requirements. Furthermore, this method involves an interactive motion entropy model that exploits correlations between bi-directional motion latent representations by interactively leveraging partitioned latent segments as directional priors. Second, we propose a selective temporal fusion method that predicts bi-directional fusion weights to achieve discriminative utilization of bi-directional multi-scale temporal contexts with varying qualities. Additionally, this method introduces a hyperprior-based implicit alignment mechanism for contextual entropy modeling. By treating the hyperprior as a surrogate for the contextual latent representation, this mechanism implicitly mitigates the misalignment in the fused bi-directional temporal priors. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed codec outperforms state-of-the-art neural B-frame codecs and achieves comparable or even superior compression performance to the H.266/VVC reference software under random-access configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Criss-Cross Deletion Correcting Codes: Optimal Constructions with Efficient Decoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07607v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses fundamental challenges in two-dimensional error correction by constructing optimal codes for \emph{criss-cross deletions}. We consider an $ n \times n $ array over a $ q $-ary alphabet $\Sigma_q := \{0, 1, \ldots, q-1\}$ that is subject to a \emph{$(t_r, t_c)$-criss-cross deletion}, which involves the simultaneous removal of $ t_r $ rows and $ t_c $ columns. A code $\mathcal{C} \subseteq \Sigma_q^{n \times n}$ is defined as a \emph{$(t_r,t_c)$-criss-cross deletion correcting code} if it can successfully correct these deletions. We derive a sphere-packing type lower bound and a Gilbert-Varshamov type upper bound on the redundancy of optimal codes. Our results indicate that the optimal redundancy for a $(t_r, t_c)$-criss-cross deletion correcting code lies between $(t_r + t_c)n\log q + (t_r + t_c)\log n + O_{q,t_r,t_c}(1)$ and $(t_r + t_c)n\log q + 2(t_r + t_c)\log n + O_{q,t_r,t_c}(1)$, where the logarithm is on base two, and $O_{q,t_r,t_c}(1)$ is a constant that depends solely on $q$, $t_r$, and $t_c$. For the case of $(1,1)$-criss-cross deletions, we develop two families of constructions. One achieves a redundancy of $2n\log q + 2\log n$ for non-binary alphabets, while the other requires $2n\log q + 2\log n + O_q(1)$ bits of redundancy for arbitrary alphabets. Both constructions match our lower bound, differing only by a constant $O_q(1)$ that depends solely on $q$, thereby confirming their optimality. For the case of $(t_r, t_c)$-criss-cross deletions, we provide a strategy to derive optimal codes when both unidirectional deletions occur consecutively. We propose decoding algorithms with a time complexity of $O(n^2)$ for our codes, which are optimal for two-dimensional scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compliance-to-Code: Enhancing Financial Compliance Checking via Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.19804v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, regulatory compliance has become a cornerstone of corporate governance, ensuring adherence to systematic legal frameworks. At its core, financial regulations often comprise highly intricate provisions, layered logical structures, and numerous exceptions, which inevitably result in labor-intensive or comprehension challenges. To mitigate this, recent Regulatory Technology (RegTech) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in automating the conversion of regulatory text into executable compliance logic. However, their performance remains suboptimal particularly when applied to Chinese-language financial regulations, due to three key limitations: (1) incomplete domain-specific knowledge representation, (2) insufficient hierarchical reasoning capabilities, and (3) failure to maintain temporal and logical coherence. One promising solution is to develop a domain specific and code-oriented datasets for model training. Existing datasets such as LexGLUE, LegalBench, and CODE-ACCORD are often English-focused, domain-mismatched, or lack fine-grained granularity for compliance code generation. To fill these gaps, we present Compliance-to-Code, the first large-scale Chinese dataset dedicated to financial regulatory compliance. Covering 1,159 annotated clauses from 361 regulations across ten categories, each clause is modularly structured with four logical elements-subject, condition, constraint, and contextual information-along with regulation relations. We provide deterministic Python code mappings, detailed code reasoning, and code explanations to facilitate automated auditing. To demonstrate utility, we present FinCheck: a pipeline for regulation structuring, code generation, and report generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pixel-Sensitive and Robust Steganography Based on Polar Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07404v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Steganography is an information hiding technique for covert communication. The core issue in steganography design is the rate-distortion coding problem. Polar codes, which have been proven to achieve the rate-distortion bound for any binary symmetric source, are utilized to design a steganographic scheme that can reach the embedding capacity for the Distortion-Limited Sender problem in certain cases. In adaptive steganography, for attack scenarios where each noise element can have different intensities, existing steganographic coding methods fail to resist such attacks. In this paper, we propose a pixel-sensitive and robust steganographic scheme based on polar codes. Our steganographic scheme not only matches the adaptive distortion well but is also robust against sophisticated noise attacks. Futher, it is proven that our scheme achieves the embedding capacity in certain cases. Experimentally, a steganographic scheme can be designed and implemented with a secret message error rate at the $10^{-5}$ level when the attack noise is known to both the sender and the receiver. This demonstrates its significant robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Image Semantic Communication via Nonlinear Transform Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07391v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates distributed source-channel coding for correlated image semantic transmission over wireless channels. In this setup, correlated images at different transmitters are separately encoded and transmitted through dedicated channels for joint recovery at the receiver. We propose a general approach for distributed image semantic communication that applies to both separate source and channel coding (SSCC) and joint source-channel coding (JSCC). Unlike existing learning-based approaches that implicitly learn source correlation in a purely data-driven manner, our method leverages nonlinear transform coding (NTC) to explicitly model source correlation from both probabilistic and geometric perspectives. A joint entropy model approximates the joint distribution of latent representations to guide adaptive rate allocation, while a transformation module aligns latent features for maximal correlation learning at the decoder. We implement this framework as D-NTSC for SSCC and D-NTSCC for JSCC, both built on Swin Transformers for effective feature extraction and correlation exploitation. Variational inference is employed to derive principled loss functions that jointly optimize encoding, decoding, and joint entropy modeling. Extensive experiments on real-world multi-view datasets demonstrate that D-NTSC and D-NTSCC outperform existing distributed SSCC and distributed JSCC baselines, respectively, achieving state-of-the-art performance in both pixel-level and perceptual quality metrics.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2503.21249</p></details> |
| **[The error-correcting pair for several classes of NMDS linear codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07380v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The error-correcting pair is a general algebraic decoding method for linear codes. The near maximal distance separable (NMDS) linear code is a subclass of linear codes and has applications in secret sharing scheme and communication systems due to the efficient performance, thus we focus on the error-correcting pair of NMDS linear codes. In 2023, He and Liao showed that for an NMDS linear code $\mathcal{C}$ with minimal distance $2\ell+1$ or $2\ell+2$, if $\mathcal{C}$ has an $\ell$-error-correcting pair $\left( \mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B} \right)$, then the parameters of $\mathcal{A}$ have 6 or 10 possibilities, respectively. In this manuscript, basing on Product Singleton Bound, we give several necessary conditions for that the NMDS linear code $\mathcal{C}$ with minimal distance $2\ell+1$ has an $\ell$-error-correcting pair $(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B})$, where the parameters of $\mathcal{A}$ is the 1st, 2nd, 4th or 5th case, then basing on twisted generalized Reed-Solomon codes, we give an example for that the parameters of $\mathcal{A}$ is the 1st case. Moreover, we also give several necessary conditions for that the NMDS linear code $\mathcal{C}$ with minimal distance $2\ell+2$ has an $\ell$-error-correcting pair $(\mathcal{A}, \mathcal{B})$, where the parameters of $\mathcal{A}$ is the 2nd, 4th, 7th or 8th case, then we give an example for that the parameters of $\mathcal{A}$ is the 1st or 2nd case, respectively.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Generative Models at the Frontier of Compression: A Survey on Generative Face Video Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07369v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of deep generative models has greatly advanced video compression, reshaping the paradigm of face video coding through their powerful capability for semantic-aware representation and lifelike synthesis. Generative Face Video Coding (GFVC) stands at the forefront of this revolution, which could characterize complex facial dynamics into compact latent codes for bitstream compactness at the encoder side and leverages powerful deep generative models to reconstruct high-fidelity face signal from the compressed latent codes at the decoder side. As such, this well-designed GFVC paradigm could enable high-fidelity face video communication at ultra-low bitrate ranges, far surpassing the capabilities of the latest Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard. To pioneer foundational research and accelerate the evolution of GFVC, this paper presents the first comprehensive survey of GFVC technologies, systematically bridging critical gaps between theoretical innovation and industrial standardization. In particular, we first review a broad range of existing GFVC methods with different feature representations and optimization strategies, and conduct a thorough benchmarking analysis. In addition, we construct a large-scale GFVC-compressed face video database with subjective Mean Opinion Scores (MOSs) based on human perception, aiming to identify the most appropriate quality metrics tailored to GFVC. Moreover, we summarize the GFVC standardization potentials with a unified high-level syntax and develop a low-complexity GFVC system which are both expected to push forward future practical deployments and applications. Finally, we envision the potential of GFVC in industrial applications and deliberate on the current challenges and future opportunities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Watermarking Language Models with Error Correcting Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10281v4)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large language models enables the creation of realistic machine-generated content. Watermarking is a promising approach to distinguish machine-generated text from human text, embedding statistical signals in the output that are ideally undetectable to humans. We propose a watermarking framework that encodes such signals through an error correcting code. Our method, termed robust binary code (RBC) watermark, introduces no noticeable degradation in quality. We evaluate our watermark on base and instruction fine-tuned models and find that our watermark is robust to edits, deletions, and translations. We provide an information-theoretic perspective on watermarking, a powerful statistical test for detection and for generating $p$-values, and theoretical guarantees. Our empirical findings suggest our watermark is fast, powerful, and robust, comparing favorably to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

However current LLMs, despite producing functional code, do not prioritize security and may generate code with exploitable vulnerabilities. In this work, we propose techniques for generating code that is more likely to be secure and introduce SCGAgent, a proactive secure coding agent that implements our techniques. We use security coding guidelines that articulate safe programming practices, combined with LLM-generated unit tests to preserve functional correctness. In our evaluation, we find that SCGAgent is able to preserve nearly 98% of the functionality of the base Sonnet-3.7 LLM while achieving an approximately 25% improvement in security. Moreover, SCGAgent is able to match or best the performance of sophisticated reasoning LLMs using a non-reasoning model and an agentic workflow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Selective Prompt Anchoring for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09121v5)** | 2025-06-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have transformed software development by automatically generating code from natural language. Yet challenges remain in generating fully correct code that aligns with user intent. Our study reveals that LLMs tend to pay less attention to user prompts as more code tokens are generated. We hypothesize that this attention dilution issue is an important reason for code generation errors. To mitigate this issue, we propose Selective Prompt Anchoring (SPA) to guide code LLMs to pay more attention to user intent when generating code. We evaluate SPA using six base LLMs across six benchmarks. Our results demonstrate that SPA enhances Pass@1 by up to 12.9%, consistently outperforming SOTA code generation methods in all settings. Our code is available at https://github.com/magic-YuanTian/Selective-Prompt-Anchoring.</p></details> | Accepted by ICML'25 |

While recent work has explored the use of large language models (LLMs) for sequence-level tagging, few approaches systematically investigate how well these models capture syntactic structure in code-switched contexts. Moreover, existing parsers trained on monolingual treebanks often fail to generalize to multilingual and mixed-language input. To address this gap, we introduce the BiLingua Parser, an LLM-based annotation pipeline designed to produce Universal Dependencies (UD) annotations for code-switched text. First, we develop a prompt-based framework for Spanish-English and Spanish-Guaran\'i data, combining few-shot LLM prompting with expert review. Second, we release two annotated datasets, including the first Spanish-Guaran\'i UD-parsed corpus. Third, we conduct a detailed syntactic analysis of switch points across language pairs and communicative contexts. Experimental results show that BiLingua Parser achieves up to 95.29% LAS after expert revision, significantly outperforming prior baselines and multilingual parsers. These results show that LLMs, when carefully guided, can serve as practical tools for bootstrapping syntactic resources in under-resourced, code-switched environments.

Drawing on knowledge from a group of medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim, examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning. LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in code-centric LLM reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page at https://livecodebenchpro.com/</p></details> |
| **[Interior Point Differential Dynamic Programming, Redux](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08278v3)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present IPDDP2, a structure-exploiting algorithm for solving discrete-time, finite-horizon optimal control problems (OCPs) with nonlinear constraints. Inequality constraints are handled using a primal-dual interior point formulation and step acceptance for equality constraints follows a line-search filter approach. The iterates of the algorithm are derived under the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) framework. A proof of local quadratic convergence of the IPDDP2 iterates is provided. Our numerical experiments evaluate IPDDP2 on over 500 OCPs derived from five different classes of robotic motion planning problems, three of which are contact-implicit trajectory optimisation problems. IPDDP2 demonstrates improvements in robustness against existing constrained DDP algorithms for contact-implicit planning, while being significantly faster than general-purpose solver IPOPT. We provide a full implementation of IPDDP2 in the Julia programming language.</p></details> |  |
| **[KEENHash: Hashing Programs into Function-Aware Embeddings for Large-Scale Binary Code Similarity Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11612v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary code similarity analysis (BCSA) is a crucial research area in many fields such as cybersecurity. Specifically, function-level diffing tools are the most widely used in BCSA: they perform function matching one by one for evaluating the similarity between binary programs. However, such methods need a high time complexity, making them unscalable in large-scale scenarios (e.g., 1/n-to-n search). Towards effective and efficient program-level BCSA, we propose KEENHash, a novel hashing approach that hashes binaries into program-level representations through large language model (LLM)-generated function embeddings. KEENHash condenses a binary into one compact and fixed-length program embedding using K-Means and Feature Hashing, allowing us to do effective and efficient large-scale program-level BCSA, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that KEENHash is at least 215 times faster than the state-of-the-art function matching tools while maintaining effectiveness. Furthermore, in a large-scale scenario with 5.3 billion similarity evaluations, KEENHash takes only 395.83 seconds while these tools will cost at least 56 days. We also evaluate KEENHash on the program clone search of large-scale BCSA across extensive datasets in 202,305 binaries. Compared with 4 state-of-the-art methods, KEENHash outperforms all of them by at least 23.16%, and displays remarkable superiority over them in the large-scale BCSA security scenario of malware detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Quadratic Programming Approach to Flight Envelope Protection Using Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18951v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safe operation of aerospace systems within their prescribed flight envelope is a fundamental requirement for modern flight control systems. Flight envelope protection prevents violations of aerodynamic, structural, and performance constraints, mitigating risks such as stall, excessive loads, and loss of control. Conventional FEP approaches, such as reference clipping via saturation functions and model-based command filtering, impose constraints at the reference input level but often fail to account for closed-loop system dynamics, potentially leading to constraint violations during transients. This paper introduces a new approach to the flight envelope protection problem by employing a quadratic programming-based safety filter using control barrier functions to dynamically enforce flight envelope constraints while preserving control performance. Unlike traditional reference filtering methods, the control barrier function-based safety filter actively ensures strict forward invariance of the safe flight envelope set, integrating seamlessly with existing control architectures. The proposed framework is implemented in a nonlinear missile flight control system and evaluated in a simulated environment. The results demonstrate its ability to prevent constraint violations while minimizing conservatism, offering a robust alternative to existing flight envelope protection methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 12 figures, submitted to the AIAA Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics as an Engineering Note</p></details> |

On the one hand, the analysis needs to be precise enough to draw meaningful conclusions. On the other hand, relevant programs in practice are large and require substantial abstraction. It is this inherent trade-off that is the crux of the problem. In this work, we present AProVE, a tool that uses symbolic execution to analyze termination of memory-manipulating C programs. While traditionally, AProVE's focus was on the preciseness of the analysis, we describe how we adapted our approach towards a modular analysis. Due to this adaption, our approach can now also handle recursive programs. Moreover, we present further performance improvements which we developed to make AProVE scale to large programs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Time To Impeach LLM-as-a-Judge: Programs are the Future of Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10403v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are widely used to evaluate the quality of LLM generations and responses, but this leads to significant challenges: high API costs, uncertain reliability, inflexible pipelines, and inherent biases. To address these, we introduce PAJAMA (Program-As-a-Judge for Automated Model Assessment), a new alternative that uses LLMs to synthesize executable judging programs instead of directly scoring responses. These synthesized programs can be stored and run locally, costing orders of magnitude less while providing interpretable, and auditable judging logic that can be easily adapted. Program-based judges mitigate biases, improving judgment consistency by 15.83% and reducing biased responses by 23.7% on average compared to a Qwen2.5-14B-based LLM-as-a-judge. When program judgments are distilled into a model, PAJAMA outperforms LLM-as-a-judge on the challenging CHAT-HARD subset of RewardBench, outperforming metrics by 2.19% on Prometheus and 8.67% on the JudgeLM dataset, all at three orders of magnitude lower cost.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-task Representation Learning for Mixed Integer Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14409v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed Integer Linear Programs (MILPs) are highly flexible and powerful tools for modeling and solving complex real-world combinatorial optimization problems. Recently, machine learning (ML)-guided approaches have demonstrated significant potential in improving MILP-solving efficiency. However, these methods typically rely on separate offline data collection and training processes, which limits their scalability and adaptability. This paper introduces the first multi-task learning framework for ML-guided MILP solving. The proposed framework provides MILP embeddings helpful in guiding MILP solving across solvers (e.g., Gurobi and SCIP) and across tasks (e.g., Branching and Solver configuration). Through extensive experiments on three widely used MILP benchmarks, we demonstrate that our multi-task learning model performs similarly to specialized models within the same distribution. Moreover, it significantly outperforms them in generalization across problem sizes and tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Balans: Multi-Armed Bandits-based Adaptive Large Neighborhood Search for Mixed-Integer Programming Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.14382v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-integer programming (MIP) is a powerful paradigm for modeling and solving various important combinatorial optimization problems. Recently, learning-based approaches have shown a potential to speed up MIP solving via offline training that then guides important design decisions during the search. However, a significant drawback of these methods is their heavy reliance on offline training, which requires collecting training datasets and computationally costly training epochs yet offering only limited generalization to unseen (larger) instances. In this paper, we propose Balans, an adaptive meta-solver for MIPs with online learning capability that does not require any supervision or apriori training. At its core, Balans is based on adaptive large-neighborhood search, operating on top of an MIP solver by successive applications of destroy and repair neighborhood operators. During the search, the selection among different neighborhood definitions is guided on the fly for the instance at hand via multi-armed bandit algorithms. Our extensive experiments on hard optimization instances show that Balans offers significant performance gains over the default MIP solver, is better than committing to any single best neighborhood, and improves over the state-of-the-art large-neighborhood search for MIPs. Finally, we release Balans as a highly configurable, MIP solver agnostic, open-source software.</p></details> |  |

In these so-called brownfield software development settings, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) coding assistants like GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software development practices, yet the impact of GenAI on student programmers performing brownfield development tasks remains underexplored. This paper investigates how GitHub Copilot influences undergraduate students' programming performance, behaviors, and understanding when completing brownfield programming tasks in which they add new code to an unfamiliar code base. We conducted a controlled experiment in which 10 undergraduate computer science students completed highly similar brownfield development tasks with and without Copilot in a legacy web application. Using a mixed-methods approach combining performance analysis, behavioral analysis, and exit interviews, we found that students completed tasks 35% faster (p < 0.05) and made 50% more solution progress p (< 0.05) when using Copilot. Moreover, our analysis revealed that, when using Copilot, students spent 11% less time manually writing code (p < 0.05), and 12% less time conducting web searches (p < 0.05), providing evidence of a fundamental shift in how they engaged in programming. In exit interviews, students reported concerns about not understanding how or why Copilot suggestions work. This research suggests the need for computing educators to develop new pedagogical approaches that leverage GenAI assistants' benefits while fostering reflection on how and why GenAI suggestions address brownfield programming tasks. Complete study results and analysis are presented at https://ghcopilot-icer.github.io/.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Our approach first regularizes the primal problem with the von Neumann entropy, then solve the regularized problem using dual gradient ascent with respect to a problem-adapted norm. In particular, we show that the dual gradient norm converges to zero at a rate independent of the ambient dimension and, via rounding arguments, construct primal-feasible solutions in certain special cases. We also derive explicit convergence rates for the objective. In order to achieve optimal computational scaling, we must accommodate the use of stochastic gradients constructed via randomized trace estimators. Throughout we illustrate the generality of our framework via three important special cases -- the Goemans-Williamson SDP relaxation of the Max-Cut problem, the optimal transport linear program, and several SDP relaxations of the permutation synchronization problem. Numerical experiments confirm that our methods achieve dimension-independent convergence in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Rust Unit Test Coverage through Hybrid Program Analysis and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09002v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit testing is essential for ensuring software reliability and correctness. Classic Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) methods and concolic execution-based approaches for generating unit tests often fail to achieve high coverage due to difficulties in handling complex program units, such as branching conditions and external dependencies. Recent work has increasingly utilized large language models (LLMs) to generate test cases, improving the quality of test generation by providing better context and correcting errors in the model's output. However, these methods rely on fixed prompts, resulting in relatively low compilation success rates and coverage. This paper presents PALM, an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance the generation of high-coverage unit tests. PALM performs program analysis to identify branching conditions within functions, which are then combined into path constraints. These constraints and relevant contextual information are used to construct prompts that guide the LLMs in generating unit tests. We implement the approach and evaluate it in 10 open-source Rust crates. Experimental results show that within just two or three hours, PALM can significantly improves test coverage compared to classic methods, with increases in overall project coverage exceeding 50% in some instances and its generated tests achieving an average coverage of 75.77%, comparable to human effort (71.30%), highlighting the potential of LLMs in automated test generation. We submitted 91 PALM-generated unit tests targeting new code. Of these submissions, 80 were accepted, 5 were rejected, and 6 remain pending review. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating program analysis with AI and open new avenues for future research in automated software testing.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Causal Graph Recovery in Neuroimaging through Answer Set Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09286v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning graphical causal structures from time series data presents significant challenges, especially when the measurement frequency does not match the causal timescale of the system. This often leads to a set of equally possible underlying causal graphs due to information loss from sub-sampling (i.e., not observing all possible states of the system throughout time). Our research addresses this challenge by incorporating the effects of sub-sampling in the derivation of causal graphs, resulting in more accurate and intuitive outcomes. We use a constraint optimization approach, specifically answer set programming (ASP), to find the optimal set of answers. ASP not only identifies the most probable underlying graph, but also provides an equivalence class of possible graphs for expert selection. In addition, using ASP allows us to leverage graph theory to further prune the set of possible solutions, yielding a smaller, more accurate answer set significantly faster than traditional approaches. We validate our approach on both simulated data and empirical structural brain connectivity, and demonstrate its superiority over established methods in these experiments. We further show how our method can be used as a meta-approach on top of established methods to obtain, on average, 12% improvement in F1 score. In addition, we achieved state of the art results in terms of precision and recall of reconstructing causal graph from sub-sampled time series data. Finally, our method shows robustness to varying degrees of sub-sampling on realistic simulations, whereas other methods perform worse for higher rates of sub-sampling.</p></details> |  |

A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |
| **[Program Synthesis from Partial Traces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14480v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first technique to synthesize programs that compose side-effecting functions, pure functions, and control flow, from partial traces containing records of only the side-effecting functions. This technique can be applied to synthesize API composing scripts from logs of calls made to those APIs, or a script from traces of system calls made by a workload, for example. All of the provided traces are positive examples, meaning that they describe desired behavior. Our approach does not require negative examples. Instead, it generalizes over the examples and uses cost metrics to prevent over-generalization. Because the problem is too complex for traditional monolithic program synthesis techniques, we propose a new combination of optimizing rewrites and syntax-guided program synthesis. The resulting program is correct by construction, so its output will always be able to reproduce the input traces. We evaluate the quality of the programs synthesized when considering various optimization metrics and the synthesizer's efficiency on real-world benchmarks. The results show that our approach can generate useful real-world programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at PLDI 2025 (46th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation)</p></details> |

The key idea is to decompose synthesis tasks into simpler relational synthesis subtasks. Specifically, our representation decomposes a training input-output example into sets of input and output facts respectively. We then learn relations between the input and output facts. We demonstrate our approach using an off-the-shelf inductive logic programming (ILP) system on four challenging synthesis datasets. Our results show that (i) our representation can outperform a standard one, and (ii) an off-the-shelf ILP system with our representation can outperform domain-specific approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-lingual Transfer in Programming Languages: An Extensive Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16937v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various software engineering tasks, including error detection, clone detection, and code translation, primarily leveraging high-resource programming languages like Python and Java. However, many critical languages, such as COBOL, as well as emerging languages, such as Rust and Swift, remain low-resource due to limited openly available code. This scarcity hampers the training and effectiveness of LLMs for these languages, increasing software maintenance costs and stifling innovation. Addressing this gap, we investigate the potential of transfer learning to enhance LLM performance on low-resource programming languages by leveraging data from high-resource counterparts. Our extensive empirical study evaluates transferability across 10 to 41 programming languages and five key tasks: code generation, clone detection, code repair, solution domain classification, and error detection. Additionally, we develop a performance prediction model to guess the best source languages for a given target and task, and analyze the features that influence transfer performance. We further replicate a representative subset of experiments with a larger model to test the generalizability of our conclusions to contemporary large-scale LLMs. Our findings demonstrate that cross-lingual transfer significantly outperforms zero-shot learning, with effectiveness varying based on both source and target languages. Furthermore, our model reliably predicts successful transfer sources by considering linguistic and dataset-specific features, offering practical guidance for data acquisition and model training. This work contributes to the development of LLM-driven tools for low-resource programming languages and provides insights into the characteristics that facilitate transfer across language pairs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (06/2025) 26 pages, 5 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

The advanced capabilities of LLM-based programming assistants to support software development tasks have led to a rise in the adoption of LLMs in SE. However, little is known about the evidenced-based practices, tools and processes verified by research findings, supported and adopted by AI programming assistants. To this end, our work conducts a preliminary evaluation exploring the beliefs of LLM used to support software development tasks. We investigate 17 evidence-based claims posited by empirical SE research across five LLM-based programming assistants. Our findings show that LLM-based programming assistants have ambiguous beliefs regarding research claims and lack credible evidence to support responses. Based on our results, we provide implications for practitioners adopting LLM-based programming assistants in development contexts and shed light on future research directions to enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs -- aiming to increase awareness and adoption of evidence-based SE research findings in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Outcome Logic: A Unified Approach to the Metatheory of Program Logics with Branching Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04594v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Starting with Hoare Logic over 50 years ago, numerous program logics have been devised to reason about the diverse programs encountered in the real world. This includes reasoning about computational effects, particularly those effects that cause the program execution to branch into multiple paths due to, e.g., nondeterministic or probabilistic choice. The recently introduced Outcome Logic reimagines Hoare Logic with branching at its core, using an algebraic representation of choice to capture programs that branch into many outcomes. In this article, we expand on prior Outcome Logic papers in order to give a more authoritative and comprehensive account of the metatheory. This includes a relatively complete proof system for Outcome Logic with the ability to reason about general purpose looping. We also show that this proof system applies to programs with various types of branching and that it facilitates the reuse of proof fragments across different kinds of specifications.</p></details> |  |

To improve the interpretability and transparency in control systems, models can be defined as white-box symbolic policies described by mathematical expressions. For better performance in partially observable and volatile environments, the symbolic policies are extended with memory represented by continuous-time latent variables, governed by differential equations. Genetic programming is used for optimisation, resulting in interpretable policies consisting of symbolic expressions. Our results show that symbolic policies with memory compare with black-box policies on a variety of control tasks. Furthermore, the benefit of the memory in symbolic policies is demonstrated on experiments where memory-less policies fall short. Overall, we present a method for evolving high-performing symbolic policies that offer interpretability and transparency, which lacks in black-box models.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages including references and appendix, 7 figures, 1 algorithm, 6 tables</p></details> |

The language introduces anaphoric constructs, such as pronoun variables (e.g., "it", "them"), that are statically resolved through referent-tracking analysis combined with a Hindley-Milner-style type system. Each pronoun is guaranteed to be unambiguous and well-typed at compile time. The Linguine compiler pipeline includes lexing, parsing, clause graph construction, desugaring into a typed intermediate representation, type inference, and abstract interpretation. This enables the early detection of semantic errors, such as undefined or type-inconsistent references. A lightweight backend currently generates Python code. This paper formalizes the core language, defines its typing and operational semantics, and proves the soundness of its pronoun resolution mechanism. An initial evaluation shows that Linguine allows the expression of concise and readable programs while supporting static verification. Linguine represents a step toward programming systems that prioritize human linguistic intuition while remaining grounded in formal methods and type-theoretic rigor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compiling Metric Temporal Answer Set Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08150v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a computational approach to Metric Answer Set Programming (ASP) to allow for expressing quantitative temporal constrains, like durations and deadlines. A central challenge is to maintain scalability when dealing with fine-grained timing constraints, which can significantly exacerbate ASP's grounding bottleneck. To address this issue, we leverage extensions of ASP with difference constraints, a simplified form of linear constraints, to handle time-related aspects externally. Our approach effectively decouples metric ASP from the granularity of time, resulting in a solution that is unaffected by time precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Collaborative Conversational Agent System Based on LLMs and Answer Set Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06438v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the Large-Language-Model-driven (LLM-driven) Artificial Intelligence (AI) bots became popular, people realized their strong potential in Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD). However, bots relying wholly on LLMs are unreliable in their knowledge, and whether they can finally produce a correct outcome for the task is not guaranteed. The collaboration among these agents also remains a challenge, since the necessary information to convey is unclear, and the information transfer is by prompts: unreliable, and malicious knowledge is easy to inject. With the help of knowledge representation and reasoning tools such as Answer Set Programming (ASP), conversational agents can be built safely and reliably, and communication among the agents made more reliable as well. We propose a Manager-Customer-Service Dual-Agent paradigm, where ASP-driven bots share the same knowledge base and complete their assigned tasks independently. The agents communicate with each other through the knowledge base, ensuring consistency. The knowledge and information conveyed are encapsulated and invisible to the users, ensuring the security of information transmission. To illustrate the dual-agent conversational paradigm, we have constructed AutoManager, a collaboration system for managing the drive-through window of a fast-food restaurant such as Taco Bell in the US. In AutoManager, the customer service bot takes the customer's order while the manager bot manages the menu and food supply. We evaluated our AutoManager system and compared it with the real-world Taco Bell Drive-Thru AI Order Taker, and the results show that our method is more reliable.</p></details> | 9 pages |

To aid debugging, program reduction techniques try to produce a smaller variant of the input program that still triggers the bug. However, existing execution-unaware program reduction techniques struggle with large and complex Wasm programs, because they rely on static information and apply syntactic transformations, while ignoring the valuable information offered by the input program's execution behavior. We present RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce, novel execution-aware program reduction techniques that leverage execution behaviors via record and replay. RR-Reduce identifies a bug-triggering function as the target function, isolates that function from the rest of the program, and generates a reduced program that replays only the interactions between the target function and the rest of the program. Hybrid-Reduce combines a complementary execution-unaware reduction technique with RR-Reduce to further reduce program size. We evaluate RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce on 28 Wasm programs that trigger a diverse set of bugs in three engines. On average, RR-Reduce reduces the programs to 1.20 percent of their original size in 14.5 minutes, which outperforms the state of the art by 33.15 times in terms of reduction time. Hybrid-Reduce reduces the programs to 0.13 percent of their original size in 3.5 hours, which outperforms the state of the art by 3.42 times in terms of reduced program size and 2.26 times in terms of reduction time. We envision RR-Reduce as the go-to tool for rapid, on-demand debugging in minutes, and Hybrid-Reduce for scenarios where developers require the smallest possible programs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MacroSwarm: A Field-based Compositional Framework for Swarm Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10969v4)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Swarm behaviour engineering is an area of research that seeks to investigate methods and techniques for coordinating computation and action within groups of simple agents to achieve complex global goals like pattern formation, collective movement, clustering, and distributed sensing. Despite recent progress in the analysis and engineering of swarms (of drones, robots, vehicles), there is still a need for general design and implementation methods and tools that can be used to define complex swarm behaviour in a principled way. To contribute to this quest, this article proposes a new field-based coordination approach, called MacroSwarm, to design and program swarm behaviour in terms of reusable and fully composable functional blocks embedding collective computation and coordination. Based on the macroprogramming paradigm of aggregate computing, MacroSwarm builds on the idea of expressing each swarm behaviour block as a pure function, mapping sensing fields into actuation goal fields, e.g., including movement vectors. In order to demonstrate the expressiveness, compositionality, and practicality of MacroSwarm as a framework for swarm programming, we perform a variety of simulations covering common patterns of flocking, pattern formation, and collective decision-making. The implications of the inherent self-stabilisation properties of field-based computations in MacroSwarm are discussed, which formally guarantee some resilience properties and guided the design of the library.</p></details> |  |
| **[New Limits on Distributed Quantum Advantage: Dequantizing Linear Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07574v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we give two results that put new limits on distributed quantum advantage in the context of the LOCAL model of distributed computing. First, we show that there is no distributed quantum advantage for any linear program. Put otherwise, if there is a quantum-LOCAL algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ that finds an $\alpha$-approximation of some linear optimization problem $\Pi$ in $T$ communication rounds, we can construct a classical, deterministic LOCAL algorithm $\mathcal{A}'$ that finds an $\alpha$-approximation of $\Pi$ in $T$ rounds. As a corollary, all classical lower bounds for linear programs, including the KMW bound, hold verbatim in quantum-LOCAL. Second, using the above result, we show that there exists a locally checkable labeling problem (LCL) for which quantum-LOCAL is strictly weaker than the classical deterministic SLOCAL model. Our results extend from quantum-LOCAL also to finitely dependent and non-signaling distributions, and one of the corollaries of our work is that the non-signaling model and the SLOCAL model are incomparable in the context of LCL problems: By prior work, there exists an LCL problem for which SLOCAL is strictly weaker than the non-signaling model, and our work provides a separation in the opposite direction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pel, A Programming Language for Orchestrating AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13453v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new frontiers in computing, yet controlling and orchestrating their capabilities beyond simple text generation remains a challenge. Current methods, such as function/tool calling and direct code generation, suffer from limitations in expressiveness, scalability, cost, security, and the ability to enforce fine-grained control. This paper introduces Pel, a novel programming language specifically designed to bridge this gap. Inspired by the strengths of Lisp, Elixir, Gleam, and Haskell, Pel provides a syntactically simple, homoiconic, and semantically rich platform for LLMs to express complex actions, control flow, and inter-agent communication safely and efficiently. Pel's design emphasizes a minimal, easily modifiable grammar suitable for constrained LLM generation, eliminating the need for complex sandboxing by enabling capability control at the syntax level. Key features include a powerful piping mechanism for linear composition, first-class closures enabling easy partial application and functional patterns, built-in support for natural language conditions evaluated by LLMs, and an advanced Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPeL) with Common Lisp-style restarts and LLM-powered helper agents for automated error correction. Furthermore, Pel incorporates automatic parallelization of independent operations via static dependency analysis, crucial for performant agentic systems. We argue that Pel offers a more robust, secure, and expressive paradigm for LLM orchestration, paving the way for more sophisticated and reliable AI agentic frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>1.

| **[Validating Quantum State Preparation Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.05616v3)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the key steps in quantum algorithms is to prepare an initial quantum superposition state with different kinds of features. These so-called state preparation algorithms are essential to the behavior of quantum algorithms, and complicated state preparation algorithms are difficult to develop correctly and effectively. This paper presents Pqasm: a high-assurance framework implemented with the Coq proof assistant, allowing us to certify our Pqasm tool to correctly reflect quantum program behaviors. The key in the framework is to reduce the program correctness assurance of a program containing a quantum superposition state to the program correctness assurance for the program state without superposition. The reduction allows the development of an effective testing framework for testing quantum state preparation algorithm implementations on a classical computer - considered to be a hard problem with no clear solution until this point. We utilize the QuickChick property-based testing framework to test state preparation programs. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach over 5 case studies implemented using Pqasm; such cases are not even simulatable in the current quantum simulators.</p></details> | Version 3 |
| **[Object-Spatial Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15812v6)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of programming languages from low-level assembly to high-level abstractions demonstrates a fundamental principle: by constraining how programmers express computation and enriching semantic information at the language level, we can make previously undecidable program properties tractable for optimization. Building on the insight of this undecidability-lessening effect, we introduce Object-Spatial Programming (OSP), a novel programming model that extends Object-Oriented Programming by introducing topologically-aware class constructs called archetypes. OSP fundamentally inverts the traditional relationship between data and computation, enabling computation to move to data through four specialized archetypes: object classes, node classes (discrete data locations), edge classes (first-class relationships), and walker classes (mobile computational entities). By making topological relationships and traversal patterns explicit at the language level, OSP transforms previously opaque program behaviors into observable, optimizable patterns. This semantic enhancement enables runtime systems to make informed decisions about data locality, parallel execution, and distribution strategies based on explicit topology, while providing programmers with intuitive abstractions for modeling complex systems where connection topology is central to the computational model. The paradigm addresses fundamental limitations in traditional programming models when representing agent-based systems, social networks, neural networks, distributed systems, finite state machines, and other spatially-oriented computational problems, demonstrating how thoughtful abstraction design can simultaneously enhance programmer expressiveness and enable sophisticated system-level optimizations across the computing stack.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 45 pages with appendix</p></details> |
| **[Hadamard-$Π$: Equational Quantum Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06835v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing offers advantages over classical computation, yet the precise features that set the two apart remain unclear. In the standard quantum circuit model, adding a 1-qubit basis-changing gate -- commonly chosen to be the Hadamard gate -- to a universal set of classical reversible gates yields computationally universal quantum computation. However, the computational behaviours enabled by this addition are not fully characterised. We give such a characterisation by introducing a small quantum programming language extending the universal classical reversible programming language $\Pi$ with a single primitive corresponding to the Hadamard gate. The language comes equipped with a sound and complete categorical semantics that is specified by a purely equational theory, enabling reasoning about the equivalence of quantum programs in a way that can be automated. Completeness is shown by means of a novel finite presentation, and corresponding synthesis algorithm, for the groups of orthogonal matrices with entries in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]$.</p></details> | 116 pages |

Whereas semantics for concurrent or randomized programs in isolation is well studied, their combination has not been thoroughly explored and presents unique challenges. The crux of the problem is that interactions between control flow, probabilistic actions, and concurrent execution cannot be captured by straightforward generalizations of prior work on pomsets and convex languages, prominent models for those effects, individually. Our model has good domain theoretic properties, important for semantics of unbounded loops. We also prove two adequacy theorems, showing that the model subsumes typical powerdomain semantics for concurrency and convex powerdomain semantics for probabilistic nondeterminism.</p></details> |  |
| **[Denoising Programming Knowledge Tracing with a Code Graph-based Tuning Adaptor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11107v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Programming Knowledge Tracking (PKT) aims to dynamically diagnose learners' mastery levels of programming knowledge based on their coding activities, facilitating more effective and personalized programming education. However, current PKT studies primarily focus on the implicit relationship between code content and knowledge assessment, often overlooking two types of noise signals in long-term programming activities: unwanted signals from unrelated submissions and weak signals from minor modifications. This practical challenge significantly limits model performance and application. To address this issue, we propose Coda, a Code graph-based tuning adaptor designed to enhance existing PKT models by identifying and mitigating the impact of noise. Specifically, Coda first transforms the loose code sequences submitted by each learner into a compact code graph. By leveraging this code graph, unwanted signals can be identified from a semantic similarity perspective. We then apply a cluster-aware GCN to the code graph, which improves the discrimination of weak signals and enables their clustering for identification. Finally, a lightweight yet effective adaptor is incorporated into the PKT task through optimization with two noise feature-based constraints and a navigational regularization term, to correct knowledge states affected by noise. It is worth mentioning that the Coda framework is model-agnostic and can be adapted to most existing PKT solutions. Extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that Coda effectively performs the PKT task in the presence of noisy programming records, outperforming typical baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD August 2025</p></details> |
| **[SDP-CROWN: Efficient Bound Propagation for Neural Network Verification with Tightness of Semidefinite Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06665v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network verifiers based on linear bound propagation scale impressively to massive models but can be surprisingly loose when neuron coupling is crucial. Conversely, semidefinite programming (SDP) verifiers capture inter-neuron coupling naturally, but their cubic complexity restricts them to only small models. In this paper, we propose SDP-CROWN, a novel hybrid verification framework that combines the tightness of SDP relaxations with the scalability of bound-propagation verifiers. At the core of SDP-CROWN is a new linear bound, derived via SDP principles, that explicitly captures $\ell_{2}$-norm-based inter-neuron coupling while adding only one extra parameter per layer. This bound can be integrated seamlessly into any linear bound-propagation pipeline, preserving the inherent scalability of such methods yet significantly improving tightness. In theory, we prove that our inter-neuron bound can be up to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$ tighter than traditional per-neuron bounds. In practice, when incorporated into the state-of-the-art $\alpha$-CROWN verifier, we observe markedly improved verification performance on large models with up to 65 thousand neurons and 2.47 million parameters, achieving tightness that approaches that of costly SDP-based methods.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Q-WSL: Optimizing Goal-Conditioned RL with Weighted Supervised Learning via Dynamic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06648v5)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel class of advanced algorithms, termed Goal-Conditioned Weighted Supervised Learning (GCWSL), has recently emerged to tackle the challenges posed by sparse rewards in goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL). GCWSL consistently delivers strong performance across a diverse set of goal-reaching tasks due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and stability. However, GCWSL methods lack a crucial capability known as trajectory stitching, which is essential for learning optimal policies when faced with unseen skills during testing. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced when the replay buffer is predominantly filled with sub-optimal trajectories. In contrast, traditional TD-based RL methods, such as Q-learning, which utilize Dynamic Programming, do not face this issue but often experience instability due to the inherent difficulties in value function approximation. In this paper, we propose Q-learning Weighted Supervised Learning (Q-WSL), a novel framework designed to overcome the limitations of GCWSL by incorporating the strengths of Dynamic Programming found in Q-learning. Q-WSL leverages Dynamic Programming results to output the optimal action of (state, goal) pairs across different trajectories within the replay buffer. This approach synergizes the strengths of both Q-learning and GCWSL, effectively mitigating their respective weaknesses and enhancing overall performance. Empirical evaluations on challenging goal-reaching tasks demonstrate that Q-WSL surpasses other goal-conditioned approaches in terms of both performance and sample efficiency. Additionally, Q-WSL exhibits notable robustness in environments characterized by binary reward structures and environmental stochasticity.</p></details> |  |
| **[MergeRepair: An Exploratory Study on Merging Task-Specific Adapters in Code LLMs for Automated Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09568v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown high capabilities in several software development-related tasks such as program repair, documentation, code refactoring, debugging, and testing. However, training these models requires massive amount of data and significant computational resources. Adapters are specialized, small modules designed for parameter efficient fine-tuning of LLMs for specific tasks, domains, or applications without requiring extensive retraining of the entire model. These adapters offer a more efficient way to customize LLMs for particular needs, leveraging the pre-existing capabilities of the large model. Model (and adapter) merging have emerged as a technique to develop one model capable of multiple tasks, with minimal or no training required. Although model and adapter merging has shown promising performance in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, its applicability to software engineering tasks remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of merged adapters within the context of software engineering, with a particular focus on the Automated Program Repair (APR) task, through our approach, MergeRepair. In particular, we merge multiple task-specific adapters using three different merging methods, including weight-averaging, ties, and dare-ties, and evaluate the performance of the merged adapter on the APR task. We introduce a continual merging approach, a novel method in which we sequentially merge the task-specific adapters where the order and weight of the merged adapters play a significant role. We further compare the performance of our approach with a baseline method consisting of equal-weight merging applied on parameters of different adapters, where all adapters are of equal importance.</p></details> |  |

In recent MaxSAT evaluations, most MaxSAT solvers have adopted an ILP solver as part of their portfolios. This paper investigates the impact of Integer Linear Programming (ILP) preprocessing techniques on MaxSAT solving. Experimental results show that ILP preprocessing techniques help WMaxCDCL-OpenWbo1200, the winner of the MaxSAT evaluation 2024 in the unweighted track, solve 15 additional instances. Moreover, current state-of-the-art MaxSAT solvers heavily use an ILP solver in their portfolios, while our proposed approach reduces the need to call an ILP solver in a portfolio including WMaxCDCL or MaxCDCL.</p></details> |  |

To narrow this gap, we explore program-based TR (P-TR), which circumvents key limitations of text-based TR (T-TR), notably in numerical reasoning, by generating executable programs. However, applying P-TR to SLMs introduces two challenges: (i) vulnerability to heterogeneity in table layouts, and (ii) inconsistency in reasoning due to limited code generation capability. We propose Table-r1, a two-stage P-TR method designed for SLMs. Stage 1 introduces an innovative self-supervised learning task, Layout Transformation Inference, to improve tabular layout generalization from a programmatic view. Stage 2 adopts a mix-paradigm variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization, enhancing P-TR consistency while allowing dynamic fallback to T-TR when needed. Experiments on four TR benchmarks demonstrate that Table-r1 outperforms all SLM-based methods, achieving at least a 15% accuracy improvement over the base model (LLaMA-8B) across all datasets and reaching performance competitive with LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convergence of linear programming hierarchies for Gibbs states of spin systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06125v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of computing expectation values of local functions under the Gibbs distribution of a spin system. In particular, we study two families of linear programming hierarchies for this problem. The first hierarchy imposes local spin flip equalities and has been considered in the bootstrap literature in high energy physics. For this hierarchy, we prove fast convergence under a spatial mixing (decay of correlations) condition. This condition is satisfied for example above the critical temperature for Ising models on a $d$-dimensional grid. The second hierarchy is based on a Markov chain having the Gibbs state as a fixed point and has been studied in the optimization literature and more recently in the bootstrap literature. For this hierarchy, we prove fast convergence provided the Markov chain mixes rapidly. Both hierarchies lead to an $\varepsilon$-approximation for local expectation values using a linear program of size quasi-polynomial in $n/\varepsilon$, where $n$ is the total number of sites, provided the interactions can be embedded in a $d$-dimensional grid with constant $d$. Compared to standard Monte Carlo methods, an advantage of this approach is that it always (i.e., for any system) outputs rigorous upper and lower bounds on the expectation value of interest, without needing an a priori analysis of the convergence speed.</p></details> | 11 pages |

However, generating comprehensive test cases to effectively assess programming solutions remains resource-intensive and challenging for educators. This paper introduces an innovative NLP-driven method leveraging generative AI (large language models) to automate the creation of high-quality test cases for competitive programming assessments. We extensively evaluated our approach on diverse datasets, including 25 years of Romanian Informatics Olympiad (OJI) data for 5th graders, recent competitions hosted on the Kilonova.ro platform, and the International Informatics Olympiad in Teams (IIOT). Our results demonstrate that AI-generated test cases substantially enhanced assessments, notably identifying previously undetected errors in 67% of the OJI 5th grade programming problems. These improvements underscore the complementary educational value of our technique in formative assessment contexts. By openly sharing our prompts, translated datasets, and methodologies, we offer practical NLP-based tools that educators and contest organizers can readily integrate to enhance assessment quality, reduce workload, and deepen insights into learner performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 chart pies, 1 figure Pre-print version Accepted at BEA 2025</p></details> |

Tubular structures naturally yield circular cross-sections when inflated, whereas a robotic sling must be both thin enough to grow between them and their resting surface and wide enough to cradle the human. Recent works have achieved flattened cross-sections by including rigid components into the structure, but this reduces conformability to the human. We present a method of mechanically programming the cross-section of soft everting robotic structures using flexible strips that constrain radial expansion between points along the outer membrane. Our method enables simultaneously wide and thin profiles while maintaining the full multi-axis flexibility of traditional slings. We develop and validate a model relating the geometric design specifications to the fabrication parameters, and experimentally characterize their effects on growth rate. Finally, we prototype a soft growing robotic sling system and demonstrate its use for assisting a single caregiver in bed-to-chair patient transfer.</p></details> |  |

This tight coupling makes GP solutions more fragile and prone to overfitting, reducing their ability to generalize. In this work, we propose LaSER (Latent Semantic Representation Regression)} -- a general framework that decouples representation evolution from lifetime learning. At each generation, candidate programs produce features which are passed to an external learner to model the target task. This approach enables any function approximator, from linear models to neural networks, to serve as a lifetime learner, allowing expressive modeling beyond conventional symbolic forms. Here we show for the first time that LaSER can outcompete standard GP and GP followed by linear regression when it employs non-linear methods to fit coefficients to GP-generated equations against complex data sets. Further, we explore how LaSER enables the emergence of innate representations, supporting long-standing hypotheses in evolutionary learning such as the Baldwin Effect. By separating the roles of representation and adaptation, LaSER offers a principled and extensible framework for symbolic regression and classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Genetic Programming Theory and Practice (GPTP) 2025.

It is no longer necessary to be a computer specialist to use them. Paradoxically, the development of computer programs generally requires writing lines of code in a programming language whose syntax is particularly strict. This process poses many difficulties for programmers. We propose an original tool in which arbitrary programs (Turing-complete) can be developed in a completely visual manner by direct manipulation of the data, without writing a line of code. The user can thus develop an algorithm by directly visualizing the result of actions taken on the data. A method for constructing iterations is associated with the tool. It proposes to create each part, including the loop body, in a non-linear manner under visual control of the state of the data. In addition, the tool supports the production of lines of code in several languages including Python, C, Java, that correspond to the actions performed. In this article, we present the tool, the design choices, the problems to be solved, and the limits and the contributions of the direct-data-manipulation approach.</p></details> | in French language |

One of the domains of application of this type of analysis is cryptocurrency ledgers, both for the purpose of analyzing the behaviour of the ledger itself, and any user-defined programs called by it, known as smart contracts. The (extended) UTxO ledger model is a kind of ledger model where all smart contract code is stateless, and additional work must be done to model stateful programs. We formalize the application of trace-based analysis to UTxO ledgers and contracts, expressing it in the languages of topology, as well as graph and category theory. To describe valid traces of UTxO ledger executions, and their relation to the behaviour of stateful programs implemented on the ledger, we define a category of simple graphs, infinite paths in which form an ultra-metric space. Maps in this category are arbitrary partial sieve-define homomorphisms of simple graphs. Programs implemented on the ledger correspond to non-expanding maps out of the graph of valid UTxO execution traces. We reason about safety properties in this framework, and prove properties of valid UTxO ledger traces.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings LSFA 2024, arXiv:2506.05219</p></details> |

In this work, we applied logic-based machine learning methods to drive biological discovery by guiding experimentation. Genome-scale metabolic network models (GEMs) - comprehensive representations of metabolic genes and reactions - are widely used to evaluate genetic engineering of biological systems. However, GEMs often fail to accurately predict the behaviour of genetically engineered cells, primarily due to incomplete annotations of gene interactions. The task of learning the intricate genetic interactions within GEMs presents computational and empirical challenges. To efficiently predict using GEM, we describe a novel approach called Boolean Matrix Logic Programming (BMLP) by leveraging Boolean matrices to evaluate large logic programs. We developed a new system, $BMLP_{active}$, which guides cost-effective experimentation and uses interpretable logic programs to encode a state-of-the-art GEM of a model bacterial organism. Notably, $BMLP_{active}$ successfully learned the interaction between a gene pair with fewer training examples than random experimentation, overcoming the increase in experimental design space. $BMLP_{active}$ enables rapid optimisation of metabolic models to reliably engineer biological systems for producing useful compounds. It offers a realistic approach to creating a self-driving lab for biological discovery, which would then facilitate microbial engineering for practical applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeContests+: High-Quality Test Case Generation for Competitive Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05817v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competitive programming, due to its high reasoning difficulty and precise correctness feedback, has become a key task for both training and evaluating the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs). However, while a large amount of public problem data, such as problem statements and solutions, is available, the test cases of these problems are often difficult to obtain. Therefore, test case generation is a necessary task for building large-scale datasets, and the quality of the test cases directly determines the accuracy of the evaluation. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-based agent system that creates high-quality test cases for competitive programming problems. We apply this system to the CodeContests dataset and propose a new version with improved test cases, named CodeContests+. We evaluated the quality of test cases in CodeContestsPlus. First, we used 1.72 million submissions with pass/fail labels to examine the accuracy of these test cases in evaluation. The results indicated that CodeContests+ achieves significantly higher accuracy than CodeContests, particularly with a notably higher True Positive Rate (TPR). Subsequently, our experiments in LLM Reinforcement Learning (RL) further confirmed that improvements in test case quality yield considerable advantages for RL.</p></details> | 28 pages, 7 figures |

A key idea in Mirage is $\mu$Graphs, a uniform representation of tensor programs at the kernel, thread block, and thread levels of the GPU compute hierarchy. $\mu$Graphs enable Mirage to discover novel optimizations that combine algebraic transformations, schedule transformations, and generation of new custom kernels. To navigate the large search space, Mirage introduces a pruning technique based on abstraction that significantly reduces the search space and provides a certain optimality guarantee. To ensure that the optimized $\mu$Graph is equivalent to the input program, Mirage introduces a probabilistic equivalence verification procedure with strong theoretical guarantees. Our evaluation shows that Mirage outperforms existing approaches by up to 3.3$\times$ even for DNNs that are widely used and heavily optimized.

Finding a general methodology for verifying such programs is challenging due to both the number of different tools involved and the intricate interface between the ``neural'' and ``symbolic'' program components. In this paper we present a general decomposition of the neuro-symbolic verification problem into parts, and examine the problem of the embedding gap that occurs when one tries to combine proofs about the neural and symbolic components. To address this problem we then introduce Vehicle -- standing as an abbreviation for a ``verification condition language'' -- an intermediate programming language interface between machine learning frameworks, automated theorem provers, and dependently-typed formalisations of neuro-symbolic programs. Vehicle allows users to specify the properties of the neural components of neuro-symbolic programs once, and then safely compile the specification to each interface using a tailored typing and compilation procedure. We give a high-level overview of Vehicle's overall design, its interfaces and compilation & type-checking procedures, and then demonstrate its utility by formally verifying the safety of a simple autonomous car controlled by a neural network, operating in a stochastic environment with imperfect information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pushe...</summary><p>Pushed in Formal Structures for Computation and Deduction 2025</p></details> |
| **[Model Checking as Program Verification by Abstract Interpretation (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05525v1)** | 2025-06-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abstract interpretation offers a powerful toolset for static analysis, tackling precision, complexity and state-explosion issues. In the literature, state partitioning abstractions based on (bi)simulation and property-preserving state relations have been successfully applied to abstract model checking. Here, we pursue a different track in which model checking is seen as an instance of program verification. To this purpose, we introduce a suitable language-called MOKA (for MOdel checking as abstract interpretation of Kleene Algebras)-which is used to encode temporal formulae as programs. In particular, we show that (universal fragments of) temporal logics, such as ACTL or, more generally, universal mu-calculus can be transformed into MOKA programs. Such programs return all and only the initial states which violate the formula. By applying abstract interpretation to MOKA programs, we pave the way for reusing more general abstractions than partitions as well as for tuning the precision of the abstraction to remove or avoid false alarms. We show how to perform model checking via a program logic that combines under-approximation and abstract interpretation analysis to avoid false alarms. The notion of locally complete abstraction is used to dynamically improve the analysis precision via counterexample-guided domain refinement.</p></details> |  |

Triton-distributed is the first compiler that supports native overlapping optimizations for distributed AI workloads, providing a good coverage of existing optimizations from different frameworks. First, we integrate communication primitives compliant with the OpenSHMEM standard into the compiler. This enables programmers to utilize these primitives with a higher-level Python programming model. Second, we illustrate how to achieve complex joint optimization of computation, memory access, and communication with the assistance of the compiler. In particular, we show how to use overlapping techniques to hide latency and present our compiler-based programming methods in both single-node and multi-node scenarios. Finally, we showcase the performance of the code generated by our compiler. In a test environment with up to 64 devices, our compiler can fully utilize heterogeneous communication and computation resources to provide effective overlapping and high performance. In many cases, the performance of the generated code can even outperform hand-optimized code. Moreover, the development difficulty and the time cost for development using our compiler are far less than those of low-level programming such as CUDA/C++, which clearly demonstrates significant productivity advantages.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose an efficient verification framework for QEC programs. We define an assertion logic and a program logic specifically crafted for QEC programs and establish a sound proof system. We then develop an efficient method for handling verification conditions (VCs) of QEC programs: for Pauli errors, the VCs are reduced to classical assertions that can be solved by SMT solvers, and for non-Pauli errors, we provide a heuristic algorithm. We formalize the proposed program logic in Coq proof assistant, making it a verified QEC verifier. Additionally, we implement an automated QEC verifier, Veri-QEC, for verifying various fault-tolerant scenarios. We demonstrate the efficiency and broad functionality of the framework by performing different verification tasks across various scenarios. Finally, we present a benchmark of 14 verified stabilizer codes.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables; v2: Extended version of the paper in PLDI 2025; Evaluated artifact at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15267327</p></details> |

As a special case of Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problems (QCSP), QIP provides a versatile framework for addressing complex decision-making scenarios. Additionally, the inclusion of a linear objective function enables QIP to effectively model multistage robust discrete linear optimization problems, making it a powerful tool for tackling uncertainty in optimization. While two primary solution paradigms exist for QBF -- search-based and expansion-based approaches -- only search-based methods have been explored for QIP and QCSP. We introduce an expansion-based approach for QIP using Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), adapting techniques from QBF. We extend this methodology to tackle multistage robust discrete optimization problems with linear constraints and further embed it in an optimization framework, enhancing its applicability. Our experimental results highlight the advantages of this approach, demonstrating superior performance over existing search-based solvers for QIP in specific instances. Furthermore, the ability to model problems using linear constraints enables notable performance gains over state-of-the-art expansion-based solvers for QBF.</p></details> |  |

However, in the open ocean neither anchored farming nor floating farms with powerful engines are economically viable. Thus, a potential solution are farms that operate by going with the flow, utilizing minimal propulsion to strategically leverage beneficial ocean currents. In this work, we focus on low-power autonomous seaweed farms and design controllers that maximize seaweed growth by taking advantage of ocean currents. We first introduce a Dynamic Programming (DP) formulation to solve for the growth-optimal value function when the true currents are known. However, in reality only short-term imperfect forecasts with increasing uncertainty are available. Hence, we present three additional extensions. Firstly, we use frequent replanning to mitigate forecast errors. Second, to optimize for long-term growth, we extend the value function beyond the forecast horizon by estimating the expected future growth based on seasonal average currents. Lastly, we introduce a discounted finite-time DP formulation to account for the increasing uncertainty in future ocean current estimates. We empirically evaluate our approach with 30-day simulations of farms in realistic ocean conditions. Our method achieves 95.8\% of the best possible growth using only 5-day forecasts.This demonstrates that low-power propulsion is a promising method to operate autonomous seaweed farms in real-world conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) Matthias Killer and Marius Wiggert contributed equally to this work</p></details> |
| **[Image Editing As Programs with Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.04158v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation, they encounter significant challenges with instruction-driven image editing. Our research highlights a key challenge: these models particularly struggle with structurally inconsistent edits that involve substantial layout changes. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Image Editing As Programs (IEAP), a unified image editing framework built upon the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. At its core, IEAP approaches instructional editing through a reductionist lens, decomposing complex editing instructions into sequences of atomic operations. Each operation is implemented via a lightweight adapter sharing the same DiT backbone and is specialized for a specific type of edit. Programmed by a vision-language model (VLM)-based agent, these operations collaboratively support arbitrary and structurally inconsistent transformations. By modularizing and sequencing edits in this way, IEAP generalizes robustly across a wide range of editing tasks, from simple adjustments to substantial structural changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IEAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks across various editing scenarios. In these evaluations, our framework delivers superior accuracy and semantic fidelity, particularly for complex, multi-step instructions. Codes are available at https://github.com/YujiaHu1109/IEAP.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we examine the applicability of LLMs for the related but relatively unexplored task of code-equivalence checking, i.e., given two programs, whether they are functionally equivalent or not. This is an important problem since benchmarking code equivalence can play a critical role in evaluating LLM capabilities for tasks such as code re-writing and code translation. Towards this end, we present CETBench - Code Equivalence with Transformations Benchmark, constructed via a repository of programs, where two programs in the repository may be solving the same or different tasks. Each instance in our dataset is obtained by taking a pair of programs in the repository and applying a random series of pre-defined code transformations, resulting in (non-)equivalent pairs. Our analysis on this dataset reveals a surprising finding that very simple code transformations in the underlying pair of programs can result in a significant drop in performance of SOTA LLMs for the task of code-equivalence checking. To remedy this, we present a simple fine-tuning-based approach to boost LLM performance on the transformed pairs of programs. Our approach for dataset generation is generic, and can be used with repositories with varying program difficulty levels and allows for applying varying numbers as well as kinds of transformations. In our experiments, we perform ablations over the difficulty level of original programs, as well as the kind of transformations used in generating pairs for equivalence checking. Our analysis presents deep insights into the working of LLMs for the task of code-equivalence, and points to the fact that they may still be far from what could be termed as a semantic understanding of the underlying code.</p></details> |  |

The modern IT world offers significant automation of programming through software frameworks and a huge set of third-party libraries and application programming interfaces (APIs). All these tools provide most of the necessary functionality out of the box (already implemented), and quite naturally the question arises as to what is more useful for students - to teach how to use these ready-made tools or the basic principles of working and development of web applications from scratch. This paper analyzes the results of a survey conducted among IT employers, aimed to identify what, in their opinion, are the necessary technical skills that graduating students in the field of Web Programming should possess in order to join the company's work as quickly and effectively as possible.</p></details> |  |

| **[Pseudorandom bits for non-commutative programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01832v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We obtain new explicit pseudorandom generators for several computational models involving groups. Our main results are as follows: 1. We consider read-once group-products over a finite group $G$, i.e., tests of the form $\prod_{i=1}^n g_i^{x_i}$ where $g_i\in G$, a special case of read-once permutation branching programs. We give generators with optimal seed length $c_G \log(n/\varepsilon)$ over any $p$-group. The proof uses the small-bias plus noise paradigm, but derandomizes the noise to avoid the recursion in previous work. Our generator works when the bits are read in any order. Previously for any non-commutative group the best seed length was $\ge\log n\log(1/\varepsilon)$, even for a fixed order. 2. We give a reduction that "lifts" suitable generators for group products over $G$ to a generator that fools width-$w$ block products, i.e., tests of the form $\prod g_i^{f_i}$ where the $f_i$ are arbitrary functions on disjoint blocks of $w$ bits. Block products generalize several previously studied classes. The reduction applies to groups that are mixing in a representation-theoretic sense that we identify. 3. Combining (2) with (1) and other works we obtain new generators for block products over the quaternions or over any commutative group, with nearly optimal seed length. In particular, we obtain generators for read-once polynomials modulo any fixed $m$ with nearly optimal seed length. Previously this was known only for $m=2$. 4. We give a new generator for products over "mixing groups." The construction departs from previous work and uses representation theory. For constant error, we obtain optimal seed length, improving on previous work (which applied to any group). This paper identifies a challenge in the area that is reminiscent of a roadblock in circuit complexity -- handling composite moduli -- and points to several classes of groups to be attacked next.</p></details> | Minor fixes |
| **[Boosting Open-Source LLMs for Program Repair via Reasoning Transfer and LLM-Guided Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03921v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several closed-source LLMs have consistently outperformed open-source alternatives in program repair tasks, primarily due to their superior reasoning capabilities and extensive pre-training. This paper introduces Repairity, a novel three-stage methodology that significantly narrows this performance gap through reasoning extraction and reinforcement learning. Our approach: (1) systematically filters high-quality reasoning traces from closed-source models using correctness verification, (2) transfers this reasoning knowledge to open-source models via supervised fine-tuning, and (3) develops reinforcement learning with LLM-based feedback to further optimize performance. Empirical evaluation across multiple program repair benchmarks demonstrates that Repairity improves the performance of Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct, a base open source LLM, by 8.68\% on average, reducing the capability gap with Claude-Sonnet3.7, a state-of-the-art closed-source model, from 10.05% to 1.35%. Ablation studies confirm that both reasoning extraction and LLM-guided reinforcement learning contribute significantly to these improvements. Our methodology generalizes effectively to additional code-related tasks, enabling organizations to leverage high-quality program repair capabilities while maintaining the customizability, transparency, and deployment flexibility inherent to open-source models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Fair And Effective Points-Based Rewards Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03911v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Points-based rewards programs are a prevalent way to incentivize customer loyalty; in these programs, customers who make repeated purchases from a seller accumulate points, working toward eventual redemption of a free reward. These programs have recently come under scrutiny due to accusations of unfair practices in their implementation. Motivated by these concerns, we study the problem of fairly designing points-based rewards programs, with a focus on two obstacles that put fairness at odds with their effectiveness. First, due to customer heterogeneity, the seller should set different redemption thresholds for different customers to generate high revenue. Second, the relationship between customer behavior and the number of accumulated points is typically unknown; this requires experimentation which may unfairly devalue customers' previously earned points. We first show that an individually fair rewards program that uses the same redemption threshold for all customers suffers a loss in revenue of at most a factor of $1+\ln 2$, compared to the optimal personalized strategy that differentiates between customers. We then tackle the problem of designing temporally fair learning algorithms in the presence of demand uncertainty. Toward this goal, we design a learning algorithm that limits the risk of point devaluation due to experimentation by only changing the redemption threshold $O(\log T)$ times, over a horizon of length $T$. This algorithm achieves the optimal (up to polylogarithmic factors) $\widetilde{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret in expectation. We then modify this algorithm to only ever decrease redemption thresholds, leading to improved fairness at a cost of only a constant factor in regret. Extensive numerical experiments show the limited value of personalization in average-case settings, in addition to demonstrating the strong practical performance of our proposed learning algorithms.</p></details> |  |

As blockchain technology advances, smart contracts have become increasingly important across various fields. In order for smart contracts to operate correctly, the correctness of the compiler is particularly crucial. Although some research efforts have been devoted to testing Solidity compilers, they primarily focus on testing methods and do not address the core issue of generating test programs. To fill this gap, this paper designs and implements Solsmith, a test program generator specifically aimed at uncovering defects in Solidity compilers. It tests the compiler correctness by generating valid and diverse Solidity programs. We have designed a series of unique program generation strategies tailored to Solidity, including enabling optimizations more frequently, avoiding undefined behaviour, and mitigating behavioural differences caused by intermediate representations. To validate the effectiveness of Solsmith, we assess the effectiveness of the test programs generated by Solsmith using the approach of differential testing. The preliminary results show that Solsmith can generate the expected test programs and uncover four confirmed defects in Solidity compilers, demonstrating the effectiveness and potential of Solsmith.</p></details> | 11 pages, 12 figures |

Unlike 2D images, which are widely accessible, acquiring 3D assets requires specialized expertise or professional 3D scanning equipment, making it difficult to scale and raising copyright concerns. To address these challenges, we propose learning 3D representations from procedural 3D programs that automatically generate 3D shapes using simple primitives and augmentations. Remarkably, despite lacking semantic content, the 3D representations learned from the procedurally generated 3D shapes perform on par with state-of-the-art representations learned from semantically recognizable 3D models (e.g., airplanes) across various downstream 3D tasks, including shape classification, part segmentation, and masked point cloud completion. We provide a detailed analysis on factors that make a good 3D procedural program. Extensive experiments further suggest that current self-supervised learning methods on point clouds do not rely on the semantics of 3D shapes, shedding light on the nature of 3D representations learned.</p></details> | <details><summary>SynDa...</summary><p>SynData4CV @ CVPR2025 | Project Page: https://point-mae-zero.cs.virginia.edu/</p></details> |

Multi-lingual RACG systems are valuable for migrating code-bases across programming languages (PLs), yet face risks from error (e.g. adversarial data corruption) propagation in cross-lingual transfer. We construct a dataset spanning 13 PLs with nearly 14k instances to explore utility and robustness of multi-lingual RACG systems. Our investigation reveals four key insights: (1) Effectiveness: multi-lingual RACG significantly enhances multi-lingual code LLMs generation; (2) Inequality: Java demonstrate superior cross-lingual utility over Python in RACG; (3) Robustness: Adversarial attacks degrade performance significantly in mono-lingual RACG but show mitigated impacts in cross-lingual scenarios; Counterintuitively, perturbed code may improve RACG in cross-lingual scenarios; (4) Specialization: Domain-specific code retrievers outperform significantly general text retrievers. These findings establish foundation for developing effective and secure multi-lingual code assistants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Meaning-Typed Programming: Language Abstraction and Runtime for Model-Integrated Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08965v4)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software development is shifting from traditional logical programming to model-integrated applications that leverage generative AI and large language models (LLMs) during runtime. However, integrating LLMs remains complex, requiring developers to manually craft prompts and process outputs. Existing tools attempt to assist with prompt engineering, but often introduce additional complexity. This paper presents Meaning-Typed Programming (MTP) model, a novel paradigm that abstracts LLM integration through intuitive language-level constructs. By leveraging the inherent semantic richness of code, MTP automates prompt generation and response handling without additional developer effort. We introduce the by operator for seamless LLM invocation, MT-IR, a meaning-based intermediate representation for semantic extraction, and MT-Runtime, an automated system for managing LLM interactions. We implement MTP in Jac, a Python superset language and find that MTP significantly reduces coding complexity while maintaining accuracy and efficiency. Our evaluation across diverse benchmarks and user studies demonstrates that MTP outperforms existing frameworks such as DSPy and LMQL by reducing lines of code by factors of 2.3-7.5X and 1.3-10.7X respectively. For math problems from the GSM8k dataset, MTP achieves accuracy rates approaching 90%, while reducing token usage in 10 out of 13 benchmarks. This leads to cost savings up to 4.5X and runtime speedups as high as 4.75X. Additionally, MTP demonstrates resilience even when 50% of naming conventions are suboptimal, establishing it as a practical, efficient solution for streamlining model-integrated application development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empirical Evaluation of Generalizable Automated Program Repair with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03283v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) proposes bug fixes to aid developers in maintaining software. The state of the art in this domain focuses on using LLMs, leveraging their strong capabilities to comprehend specifications in natural language and to generate program code. Recent works have shown that LLMs can be used to generate repairs. However, despite the APR community's research achievements and several industry deployments in the last decade, APR still lacks the capabilities to generalize broadly. In this work, we present an intensive empirical evaluation of LLMs for generating patches. We evaluate a diverse set of 13 recent models, including open ones (e.g., Llama 3.3, Qwen 2.5 Coder, and DeepSeek R1 (dist.)) and closed ones (e.g., o3-mini, GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.0 Flash). In particular, we explore language-agnostic repairs by utilizing benchmarks for Java (e.g., Defects4J), JavaScript (e.g., BugsJS), Python (e.g., BugsInPy), and PHP (e.g., BugsPHP). Besides the generalization between different languages and levels of patch complexity, we also investigate the effects of fault localization (FL) as a preprocessing step and compare the progress for open vs closed models. Our evaluation represents a snapshot of the current repair capabilities of the latest LLMs. Key results include: (1) Different LLMs tend to perform best for different languages, which makes it hard to develop cross-platform repair techniques with single LLMs. (2) The combinations of models add value with respect to uniquely fixed bugs, so a committee of expert models should be considered. (3) Under realistic assumptions of imperfect FL, we observe significant drops in accuracy from the usual practice of using perfect FL. Our findings and insights will help both researchers and practitioners develop reliable and generalizable APR techniques and evaluate them in realistic and fair environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[It's Not Easy Being Green: On the Energy Efficiency of Programming Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05460v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Does the choice of programming language affect energy consumption? Previous highly visible studies have established associations between certain programming languages and energy consumption. A causal misinterpretation of this work has led academics and industry leaders to use or support certain languages based on their claimed impact on energy consumption. This paper tackles this causal question directly. It first corrects and improves the measurement methodology used by prior work. It then develops a detailed causal model capturing the complex relationship between programming language choice and energy consumption. This model identifies and incorporates several critical but previously overlooked factors that affect energy usage. These factors, such as distinguishing programming languages from their implementations, the impact of the application implementations themselves, the number of active cores, and memory activity, can significantly skew energy consumption measurements if not accounted for. We show -- via empirical experiments, improved methodology, and careful examination of anomalies -- that when these factors are controlled for, notable discrepancies in prior work vanish. Our analysis suggests that the choice of programming language implementation has no significant impact on energy consumption beyond execution time.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16 on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Programming Techniques for Enhancing Cognitive Representation in Knowledge Tracing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02949v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge Tracing (KT) involves monitoring the changes in a student's knowledge over time by analyzing their past responses, with the goal of predicting future performance. However, most existing methods primarily focus on feature enhancement, while overlooking the deficiencies in cognitive representation and the ability to express cognition-issues often caused by interference from non-cognitive factors such as slipping and guessing. This limitation hampers the ability to capture the continuity and coherence of the student's cognitive process. As a result, many methods may introduce more prediction bias and modeling costs due to their inability to maintain cognitive continuity and coherence. Based on the above discussion, we propose the Cognitive Representation Dynamic Programming based Knowledge Tracing (CRDP-KT) model. This model em ploys a dynamic programming algorithm to optimize cognitive representations based on the difficulty of the questions and the performance intervals between them. This approach ensures that the cognitive representation aligns with the student's cognitive patterns, maintaining overall continuity and coherence. As a result, it provides more accurate and systematic input features for subsequent model training, thereby minimizing distortion in the simulation of cognitive states. Additionally, the CRDP-KT model performs partitioned optimization of cognitive representations to enhance the reliability of the optimization process. Furthermore, it improves its ability to express the student's cognition through a weighted fusion of optimized record representations and re lationships learned from a bipartite graph. Finally, experiments conducted on three public datasets validate the effectiveness of the proposed CRDP-KT model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Complexity of Geometric programming in the Turing model and application to nonnegative tensors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.10637v3)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider a version of geometric programming problem consisting in minimizing a function given by the maximum of finitely many log-Laplace transforms of discrete nonnegative measures on a Euclidean space. Under a coerciveness assumption, we show that an $\varepsilon$-minimizer can be computed in a time that is polynomial in the input size and in $|\log\varepsilon|$. This is obtained by establishing bit-size estimates on approximate minimizers and by applying the ellipsoid method. We also derive polynomial iteration complexity bounds for the interior-point method applied to the same class of problems. We deduce that the spectral radius of a partially symmetric, weakly irreducible nonnegative tensor can be approximated within an $\varepsilon$-error in polynomial time. For strongly irreducible tensors, we show in addition that the logarithm of the positive eigenvector is polynomial time approximable. Our results also yield that the the maximum of a nonnegative homogeneous $d$-form in the $\ell_d$ unit ball can be approximated in polynomial time. In particular, the spectral radius of uniform weighted hypergraphs and some known upper bounds for the clique number of uniform hypergraphs are polynomial time computable. In contrast, we provide an example showing that the Phase I approach needs exponentially many bits to solve the feasibility problem in geometric programming.</p></details> | 36 pages |
| **[Exploring metrics for analyzing dynamic behavior in MPI programs via a coupled-oscillator model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02792v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel, lightweight, and physically inspired approach to modeling the dynamics of parallel distributed-memory programs. Inspired by the Kuramoto model, we represent MPI processes as coupled oscillators with topology-aware interactions, custom coupling potentials, and stochastic noise. The resulting system of nonlinear ordinary differential equations opens a path to modeling key performance phenomena of parallel programs, including synchronization, delay propagation and decay, bottlenecks, and self-desynchronization. This paper introduces interaction potentials to describe memory- and compute-bound workloads and employs multiple quantitative metrics -- such as an order parameter, synchronization entropy, phase gradients, and phase differences -- to evaluate phase coherence and disruption. We also investigate the role of local noise and show that moderate noise can accelerate resynchronization in scalable applications. Our simulations align qualitatively with MPI trace data, showing the potential of physics-informed abstractions to predict performance patterns, which offers a new perspective for performance modeling and software-hardware co-design in parallel computing.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hierarchical Integer Linear Programming Approach for Optimizing Team Formation in Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02756v1)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teamwork is integral to higher education, fostering students' interpersonal skills, improving learning outcomes, and preparing them for professional collaboration later in their careers. While team formation has traditionally been managed by humans, either instructors or students, algorithmic approaches have recently emerged to optimize this process. However, existing algorithmic team formation methods often focus on expert teams, overlook agency in choosing one's teammates, and are limited to a single team formation setting. These limitations make them less suitable for education, where no student can be left out, student agency is crucial for motivation, and team formation needs vary across courses and programs. In this paper, we introduce the EDUCATIONAL TEAM FORMATION problem (EDU-TF), a partitioning optimization problem model tailored to the unique needs of education, integrating both teacher and student requirements. To solve EDU-TF, we propose a modular optimization approach, one of the first to allow the flexible adjustment of objectives according to educational needs, enhancing the method's applicability across various classroom settings rather than just research environments. Results from evaluating ten strategies derived from our model on real-world university datasets indicate that our approach outperforms heuristic teacher-assigned teams by better accommodating student preferences. Our study contributes a new modular approach to partition-based algorithmic team formation and provides valuable insights for future research on team formation in educational settings.</p></details> |  |

Current methods exhibit failures in generating physically plausible arrangements that respect the provided text description. We present SceneMotifCoder (SMC), an example-driven framework for generating 3D object arrangements through visual program learning. SMC leverages large language models (LLMs) and program synthesis to overcome these challenges by learning visual programs from example arrangements. These programs are generalized into compact, editable meta-programs. When combined with 3D object retrieval and geometry-aware optimization, they can be used to create object arrangements varying in arrangement structure and contained objects. Our experiments show that SMC generates high-quality arrangements using meta-programs learned from few examples. Evaluation results demonstrates that object arrangements generated by SMC better conform to user-specified text descriptions and are more physically plausible when compared with state-of-the-art text-to-3D generation and layout methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 3DV 2025 (Oral).

| **[Pi-SQL: Enhancing Text-to-SQL with Fine-Grained Guidance from Pivot Programming Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00912v2)** | 2025-06-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Text-to-SQL transforms the user queries from natural language to executable SQL programs, enabling non-experts to interact with complex databases. Existing prompt-based methods craft meticulous text guidelines and examples to facilitate SQL generation, but their accuracy is hindered by the large semantic gap between the texts and the low-resource SQL programs. In this work, we propose Pi-SQL, which incorporates the high-resource Python program as a pivot to bridge between the natural language query and SQL program. In particular, Pi-SQL first generates Python programs that provide fine-grained step-by-step guidelines in their code blocks or comments, and then produces an SQL program following the guidance of each Python program. The final SQL program matches the reference Python program's query results and, through selection from candidates generated by different strategies, achieves superior execution speed, with a reward-based valid efficiency score up to 4.55 higher than the best-performing baseline. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of Pi-SQL, which improves the execution accuracy of the best-performing baseline by up to 3.20.</p></details> |  |
| **[SwingArena: Competitive Programming Arena for Long-context GitHub Issue Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23932v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present SwingArena, a competitive evaluation framework for Large Language Models (LLMs) that closely mirrors real-world software development workflows. Unlike traditional static benchmarks, SwingArena models the collaborative process of software iteration by pairing LLMs as submitters, who generate patches, and reviewers, who create test cases and verify the patches through continuous integration (CI) pipelines. To support these interactive evaluations, we introduce a retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) module that efficiently handles long-context challenges by providing syntactically and semantically relevant code snippets from large codebases, supporting multiple programming languages (C++, Python, Rust, and Go). This enables the framework to scale across diverse tasks and contexts while respecting token limitations. Our experiments, using over 400 high-quality real-world GitHub issues selected from a pool of 2,300 issues, show that models like GPT-4o excel at aggressive patch generation, whereas DeepSeek and Gemini prioritize correctness in CI validation. SwingArena presents a scalable and extensible methodology for evaluating LLMs in realistic, CI-driven software development settings.

A balanced signed graph is a signed graph with no cycles containing an odd number of negative edges. Laplacian of a balanced signed graph has eigenvectors that map via a simple linear transform to ones in a corresponding positive graph Laplacian, thus enabling reuse of spectral filtering tools designed for positive graphs. We propose an efficient method to learn a balanced signed graph Laplacian directly from data. Specifically, extending a previous linear programming (LP) based sparse inverse covariance estimation method called CLIME, we formulate a new LP problem for each Laplacian column $i$, where the linear constraints restrict weight signs of edges stemming from node $i$, so that nodes of same / different polarities are connected by positive / negative edges. Towards optimal model selection, we derive a suitable CLIME parameter $\rho$ based on a combination of the Hannan-Quinn information criterion and a minimum feasibility criterion. We solve the LP problem efficiently by tailoring a sparse LP method based on ADMM. We theoretically prove local solution convergence of our proposed iterative algorithm. Extensive experimental results on synthetic and real-world datasets show that our balanced graph learning method outperforms competing methods and enables reuse of spectral filters, wavelets, and graph convolutional nets (GCN) constructed for positive graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Signal Processing</p></details> |

A mixed-methods study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16764v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many application domains, domain-specific languages can allow domain experts to contribute to collaborative projects more correctly and efficiently. To do so, they must be able to understand program structure from reading existing source code. With high-quality data becoming an increasingly important resource, the creation of data pipelines is an important application domain for domain-specific languages. We execute a mixed-method study consisting of a controlled experiment and a follow-up descriptive survey among the participants to understand the effects of a domain-specific language on bottom-up program understanding and generate hypotheses for future research. During the experiment, participants need the same time to solve program structure comprehension tasks, but are significantly more correct when using the domain-specific language. In the descriptive survey, participants describe reasons related to the programming language itself, such as a better pipeline overview, more enforced code structure, and a closer alignment to the mental model of a data pipeline. In addition, human factors such as less required programming experience and the ability to reuse experience from other data engineering tools are discussed. Based on these results, domain-specific languages are a promising tool for creating data pipelines that can increase correct understanding of program structure and lower barriers to entry for domain experts. Open questions exist to make more informed implementation decisions for domain-specific languages for data pipelines in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Use o...</summary><p>Use of standard two-sided hypothesis tests and improved presentation</p></details> |

Recently, learning-to-optimize methods (L2O) for linear (LPs) or quadratic programs (QPs) using message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) have gained traction, promising lightweight, data-driven proxies for solving such optimization problems. For example, they replace the costly computation of strong branching scores in branch-and-bound solvers, requiring solving many such optimization problems. However, robust L2O MPNNs remain challenging in data-scarce settings, especially when addressing complex optimization problems such as QPs. This work introduces a principled approach to data augmentation tailored for QPs via MPNNs. Our method leverages theoretically justified data augmentation techniques to generate diverse yet optimality-preserving instances. Furthermore, we integrate these augmentations into a self-supervised learning framework based on contrastive learning, thereby pretraining MPNNs for enhanced performance on L2O tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves generalization in supervised scenarios and facilitates effective transfer learning to related optimization problems.</p></details> |  |
