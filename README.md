| **[Code Reborn AI-Driven Legacy Systems Modernization from COBOL to Java](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11335v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates AI-driven modernization of legacy COBOL code into Java, addressing a critical challenge in aging software systems. Leveraging the Legacy COBOL 2024 Corpus -- 50,000 COBOL files from public and enterprise sources -- Java parses the code, AI suggests upgrades, and React visualizes gains. Achieving 93% accuracy, complexity drops 35% (from 18 to 11.7) and coupling 33% (from 8 to 5.4), surpassing manual efforts (75%) and rule-based tools (82%). The approach offers a scalable path to rejuvenate COBOL systems, vital for industries like banking and insurance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Easy repair via codes with simplex locality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11251v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the context of distributed storage systems, locally repairable codes have become important. In this paper we focus on codes that allow for multi-erasure pattern decoding with low computational effort. Different optimality requirements, measured by the code's rate, minimum distance, locality, availability as well as field size, influence each other and can not all be maximized at the same time. We focus on the notion of easy repair, more specifically on the construction of codes that can repair correctable erasure patterns with minimal computational effort. In particular, we introduce the easy repair property and then present codes of different rates that possess this property. The presented codes are all in some way related to simplex codes and comprise block codes as well as unit-memory convolutional codes. We also formulate conditions under which the easy repairs can be performed in parallel, thus improving access speed of the distributed storage system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Proof Generation for Rust Code via Self-Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15756v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring correctness is crucial for code generation. Formal verification offers a definitive assurance of correctness, but demands substantial human effort in proof construction and hence raises a pressing need for automation. The primary obstacle lies in the severe lack of data-there is much fewer proofs than code snippets for Large Language Models (LLMs) to train upon. In this paper, we introduce SAFE, a framework that overcomes the lack of human-written proofs to enable automated proof generation of Rust code. SAFE establishes a self-evolving cycle where data synthesis and fine-tuning collaborate to enhance the model capability, leveraging the definitive power of a symbolic verifier in telling correct proofs from incorrect ones. SAFE also re-purposes the large number of synthesized incorrect proofs to train the self-debugging capability of the fine-tuned models, empowering them to fix incorrect proofs based on the verifier's feedback. SAFE demonstrates superior efficiency and precision compared to GPT-4o. Through tens of thousands of synthesized proofs and the self-debugging mechanism, we improve the capability of open-source models, initially unacquainted with formal verification, to automatically write proofs for Rust code. This advancement leads to a significant improvement in performance, achieving a 52.52% accuracy rate in a benchmark crafted by human experts, a significant leap over GPT-4o's performance of 14.39%.</p></details> |  |
| **[DPS: Design Pattern Summarisation Using Code Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11081v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic summarisation has been used efficiently in recent years to condense texts, conversations, audio, code, and various other artefacts. A range of methods, from simple template-based summaries to complex machine learning techniques -- and more recently, large language models -- have been employed to generate these summaries. Summarising software design patterns is important because it helps developers quickly understand and reuse complex design concepts, thereby improving software maintainability and development efficiency. However, the generation of summaries for software design patterns has not yet been explored. Our approach utilises code features and JavaParser to parse the code and create a JSON representation. Using an NLG library on this JSON representation, we convert it into natural language text that acts as a summary of the code, capturing the contextual information of the design pattern. Our empirical results indicate that the summaries generated by our approach capture the context in which patterns are applied in the codebase. Statistical evaluations demonstrate that our summaries closely align with human-written summaries, as evident from high values in the ROUGE-L, BLEU-4, NIST, and FrugalScore metrics. A follow-up survey further shows that DPS summaries were rated as capturing context better than human-generated summaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[New Constructions of Binary Cyclic Codes with Both Relatively Large Minimum Distance and Dual Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11010v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary cyclic codes are worth studying due to their applications and theoretical importance. It is an important problem to construct an infinite family of cyclic codes with large minimum distance $d$ and dual distance $d^{\perp}$. In recent years, much research has been devoted to improving the lower bound on $d$, some of which have exceeded the square-root bound. The constructions presented recently seem to indicate that when the minimum distance increases, the minimum distance of its dual code decreases. In this paper, we focus on the new constructions of binary cyclic codes with length $n=2^m-1$, dimension near $n/2$, and both relatively large minimum distance and dual distance. For $m$ is even, we construct a family of binary cyclic codes with parameters $[2^m-1,2^{m-1}\pm1,d]$, where $d\ge 2^{m/2}-1$ and $d^\perp\ge2^{m/2}$. Both the minimum distance and the dual distance are significantly better than the previous results. When $m$ is the product of two distinct primes, we construct some cyclic codes with dimensions $k=(n+1)/2$ and $d>\frac{n}{\log_2n},$ where the lower bound on the minimum distance is much larger than the square-root bound. For $m$ is odd, we present two families of binary $[2^m-1,2^{m-1},d]$ cyclic codes with $d\ge2^{(m+1)/2}-1$, $d^\perp\ge2^{(m+1)/2}$ and $d\ge2^{(m+3)/2}-15$, $d^\perp\ge2^{(m-1)/2}$ respectively, which leads that $d\cdot d^\perp$ can reach $2n$ asymptotically. To the best of our knowledge, except for the punctured binary Reed-Muller codes, there is no other construction of binary cyclic codes that reaches this bound.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Code LLM Training with Programmer Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14936v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human attention provides valuable yet underexploited signals for code LLM training, offering a perspective beyond purely machine-driven attention. Despite the complexity and cost of collecting eye-tracking data, there has also been limited progress in systematically using these signals for code LLM training. To address both issues, we propose a cohesive pipeline spanning augmentation and reward-based fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce (1) an eye-tracking path augmentation method to expand programmer attention datasets, (2) a pattern abstraction step that refines raw fixations into learnable attention motifs, and (3) a reward-guided strategy for integrating these insights directly into a CodeT5 supervised fine-tuning process. Our experiments yield +7.16 in CodeBLEU on the CodeXGlue benchmark for code summarization, underscoring how uniting human and machine attention can boost code intelligence. We hope this work encourages broader exploration of human-centric methods in next-generation AI4SE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uplink Assisted Joint Channel Estimation and CSI Feedback: An Approach Based on Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10836v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In frequency division duplex (FDD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems, the acquisition of downlink channel state information (CSI) is essential for maximizing spatial resource utilization and improving system spectral efficiency. The separate design of modules in AI-based CSI feedback architectures under traditional modular communication frameworks, including channel estimation (CE), CSI compression and feedback, leads to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose an uplink assisted joint CE and and CSI feedback approach via deep learning for downlink CSI acquisition, which mitigates performance degradation caused by distribution bias across separately trained modules in traditional modular communication frameworks. The proposed network adopts a deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) architecture to mitigate the cliff effect encountered in the conventional separate source-channel coding. Furthermore, we exploit the uplink CSI as auxiliary information to enhance CSI reconstruction accuracy by leveraging the partial reciprocity between the uplink and downlink channels in FDD systems, without introducing additional overhead. The effectiveness of uplink CSI as assisted information and the necessity of an end-toend multi-module joint training architecture is validated through comprehensive ablation and scalability experiments.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWE-PolyBench: A multi-language benchmark for repository level evaluation of coding agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08703v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coding agents powered by large language models have shown impressive capabilities in software engineering tasks, but evaluating their performance across diverse programming languages and real-world scenarios remains challenging. We introduce SWE-PolyBench, a new multi-language benchmark for repository-level, execution-based evaluation of coding agents. SWE-PolyBench contains 2110 instances from 21 repositories and includes tasks in Java (165), JavaScript (1017), TypeScript (729) and Python (199), covering bug fixes, feature additions, and code refactoring. We provide a task and repository-stratified subsample (SWE-PolyBench500) and release an evaluation harness allowing for fully automated evaluation. To enable a more comprehensive comparison of coding agents, this work also presents a novel set of metrics rooted in syntax tree analysis. We evaluate leading open source coding agents on SWE-PolyBench, revealing their strengths and limitations across languages, task types, and complexity classes. Our experiments show that current agents exhibit uneven performances across languages and struggle with complex problems while showing higher performance on simpler tasks. SWE-PolyBench aims to drive progress in developing more versatile and robust AI coding assistants for real-world software engineering. Our datasets and code are available at: https://github.com/amazon-science/SWE-PolyBench</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 6 figures, edited website links</p></details> |
| **[Keyword Extraction, and Aspect Classification in Sinhala, English, and Code-Mixed Content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10679v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Brand reputation in the banking sector is maintained through insightful analysis of customer opinion on code-mixed and multilingual content. Conventional NLP models misclassify or ignore code-mixed text, when mix with low resource languages such as Sinhala-English and fail to capture domain-specific knowledge. This study introduces a hybrid NLP method to improve keyword extraction, content filtering, and aspect-based classification of banking content. Keyword extraction in English is performed with a hybrid approach comprising a fine-tuned SpaCy NER model, FinBERT-based KeyBERT embeddings, YAKE, and EmbedRank, which results in a combined accuracy of 91.2%. Code-mixed and Sinhala keywords are extracted using a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa model integrated with a domain-specific Sinhala financial vocabulary, and it results in an accuracy of 87.4%. To ensure data quality, irrelevant comment filtering was performed using several models, with the BERT-base-uncased model achieving 85.2% for English and XLM-RoBERTa 88.1% for Sinhala, which was better than GPT-4o, SVM, and keyword-based filtering. Aspect classification followed the same pattern, with the BERT-base-uncased model achieving 87.4% for English and XLM-RoBERTa 85.9% for Sinhala, both exceeding GPT-4 and keyword-based approaches. These findings confirm that fine-tuned transformer models outperform traditional methods in multilingual financial text analysis. The present framework offers an accurate and scalable solution for brand reputation monitoring in code-mixed and low-resource banking environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Pag...</summary><p>6 Pages, 2 figures, 7 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Lattice Surgery Compilation Beyond the Surface Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10591v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large-scale fault-tolerant quantum computation requires compiling logical circuits into physical operations tailored to a given architecture. Prior work addressing this challenge has mostly focused on the surface code and lattice surgery schemes. In this work, we broaden the scope by considering lattice surgery compilation for topological codes beyond the surface code. We begin by defining a code substrate - a blueprint for implementing topological codes and lattice surgery. We then abstract from the microscopic details and rephrase the compilation task as a mapping and routing problem on a macroscopic routing graph, potentially subject to substrate-specific constraints. We explore specific substrates and codes, including the color code and the folded surface code, providing detailed microscopic constructions. For the color code, we present numerical simulations analyzing how design choices at the microscopic and macroscopic levels affect the depth of compiled logical $\mathrm{CNOT}+\mathrm{T}$ circuits. An open-source code is available on GitHub https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qecc.</p></details> | 12 pages, 11 figures |
| **[AI-Driven Code Refactoring: Using Graph Neural Networks to Enhance Software Maintainability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10412v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) as a transformative tool for code refactoring, using abstract syntax trees (ASTs) to boost software maintainability. It analyzes a dataset of 2 million snippets from CodeSearchNet and a custom 75000-file GitHub Python corpus, comparing GNNs against rule-based SonarQube and decision trees. Metrics include cyclomatic complexity (target below 10), coupling (target below 5), and refactoring precision. GNNs achieve 92% accuracy, reducing complexity by 35% and coupling by 33%, outperforming SonarQube (78%, 16%) and decision trees (85%, 25%). Preprocessing fixed 60% of syntax errors. Bar graphs, tables, and AST visuals clarify results. This offers a scalable AI-driven path to cleaner codebases, which is crucial for software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unique Decoding of Reed-Solomon and Related Codes for Semi-Adversarial Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10399v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For over a quarter century, the Guruswami-Sudan algorithm has served as the state-of-the-art for list-decoding Reed-Solomon (RS) codes up to the Johnson bound against adversarial errors. However, some recent structural results on the combinatorial list decoding of randomly punctured Reed-Solomon codes suggest that Johnson bound can likely be broken for some subclasses of RS codes. Motivated by these results, we seek to make traction on understanding adversarial decoding by considering a new model: semi-adversarial errors. This error model bridges between fully random errors and fully adversarial errors by allowing some symbols of a message to be corrupted by an adversary while others are replaced with uniformly random symbols. As our main quest, we seek to understand optimal efficient unique decoding algorithms in the semi-adversarial model. In particular, we revisit some classical results on decoding interleaved Reed-Solomon codes (aka subfield evaluation RS codes) in the random error model by Bleichenbacher-Kiayias-Yung (BKY) and work to improve and extend their analysis. First, we give an improved implementation and analysis of the BKY algorithm for interleaved Reed-Solomon codes in the semi-adversarial model. In particular, our algorithm runs in near-linear time, and for most mixtures of random and adversarial errors, our analysis matches the information-theoretic optimum. Moreover, inspired by the BKY algorithm, we use a novel interpolation to extend our approach to the settings of folded Reed-Solomon codes, resulting in fast algorithms for unique decoding against semi-adversarial errors. A particular advantage of our near-linear time algorithm over state-of-the-art decoding algorithms for adversarial errors is that its running time depends only on a polynomial function of the folding parameter rather than on an exponential function.</p></details> | 45 pages |
| **[SymRTLO: Enhancing RTL Code Optimization with LLMs and Neuron-Inspired Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10369v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing Register Transfer Level (RTL) code is crucial for improving the power, performance, and area (PPA) of digital circuits in the early stages of synthesis. Manual rewriting, guided by synthesis feedback, can yield high-quality results but is time-consuming and error-prone. Most existing compiler-based approaches have difficulty handling complex design constraints. Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative to address these challenges. However, LLM-based approaches often face difficulties in ensuring alignment between the generated code and the provided prompts. This paper presents SymRTLO, a novel neuron-symbolic RTL optimization framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-based code rewriting with symbolic reasoning techniques. Our method incorporates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system of optimization rules and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based templates, enabling LLM-based rewriting that maintains syntactic correctness while minimizing undesired circuit behaviors. A symbolic module is proposed for analyzing and optimizing finite state machine (FSM) logic, allowing fine-grained state merging and partial specification handling beyond the scope of pattern-based compilers. Furthermore, a fast verification pipeline, combining formal equivalence checks with test-driven validation, further reduces the complexity of verification. Experiments on the RTL-Rewriter benchmark with Synopsys Design Compiler and Yosys show that SymRTLO improves power, performance, and area (PPA) by up to 43.9%, 62.5%, and 51.1%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables.

| **[The Code Barrier: What LLMs Actually Understand?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10557v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding code represents a core ability needed for automating software development tasks. While foundation models like LLMs show impressive results across many software engineering challenges, the extent of their true semantic understanding beyond simple token recognition remains unclear. This research uses code obfuscation as a structured testing framework to evaluate LLMs' semantic understanding capabilities. We methodically apply controlled obfuscation changes to source code and measure comprehension through two complementary tasks: generating accurate descriptions of obfuscated code and performing deobfuscation, a skill with important implications for reverse engineering applications. Our testing approach includes 13 cutting-edge models, covering both code-specialized (e.g., StarCoder2) and general-purpose (e.g., GPT-4o) architectures, evaluated on a benchmark created from CodeNet and consisting of filtered 250 Java programming problems and their solutions. Findings show a statistically significant performance decline as obfuscation complexity increases, with unexpected resilience shown by general-purpose models compared to their code-focused counterparts. While some models successfully identify obfuscation techniques, their ability to reconstruct the underlying program logic remains constrained, suggesting limitations in their semantic representation mechanisms. This research introduces a new evaluation approach for assessing code comprehension in language models and establishes empirical baselines for advancing research in security-critical code analysis applications such as reverse engineering and adversarial code analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Semantic-based Optimization Approach for Repairing LLMs: Case Study on Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12899v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language Models (LMs) are widely used in software engineering for code generation, but they may produce code with errors. Rather than repairing the generated code, an alternative way is to address the underlying failures of models. LM repair offers a lightweight solution to this challenge: it requires minimal data, reduces computational costs, and reduces the side effects. Unlike retraining, LM repair focuses on applying tailored updates to targeted neurons, making it ideal for scenarios with limited resources, high-performance demands, or strict safety requirements. In this paper, we propose \ul{S}emantic \ul{T}argeting for \ul{A}nalytical \ul{R}epair (\textsc{STAR}), a pioneering and novel semantic-based optimization approach for repairing LLMs. \textsc{STAR} realizes main operations in LM repair methods in an optimization process, including locating ``buggy neurons'', solving ``neuron patches'', and patching ``buggy neurons''. Correspondingly, it computes the deltas of weight matrix as the prior information to guide optimization; and attributes the targeted layers and neurons leveraging statistical insights. The neuron patches are computed with a solid semantic-based analytical formula, which directly bridges the changes to logits with the deltas of neurons, by steering latent representations. Compared to the prior work of LM repair (\textsc{MINT}) and optimization methods (\textsc{SGD}), \textsc{STAR} integrates their strengths while mitigating their limitations. \textsc{STAR} supports solving multiple failures together, significantly improving the usefulness. Evaluated on three code generation tasks using popular code LMs, \textsc{STAR} demonstrates superior effectiveness. Additionally, \textsc{STAR} exhibits better efficiency. In terms of side effects, namely the balance between generalization and specificity, \textsc{STAR} outperforms prior work by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figure, 6 tables, under peer-review</p></details> |
| **[Separate Source Channel Coding Is Still What You Need: An LLM-based Rethinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.04285v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Along with the proliferating research interest in Semantic Communication (SemCom), Joint Source Channel Coding (JSCC) has dominated the attention due to the widely assumed existence in efficiently delivering information semantics. %has emerged as a pivotal area of research, aiming to enhance the efficiency and reliability of information transmission through deep learning-based methods. Nevertheless, this paper challenges the conventional JSCC paradigm, and advocates for adoption of Separate Source Channel Coding (SSCC) to enjoy the underlying more degree of freedom for optimization. We demonstrate that SSCC, after leveraging the strengths of Large Language Model (LLM) for source coding and Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT) complemented for channel decoding, offers superior performance over JSCC. Our proposed framework also effectively highlights the compatibility challenges between SemCom approaches and digital communication systems, particularly concerning the resource costs associated with the transmission of high precision floating point numbers. Through comprehensive evaluations, we establish that empowered by LLM-based compression and ECCT-enhanced error correction, SSCC remains a viable and effective solution for modern communication systems. In other words, separate source and channel coding is still what we need!</p></details> |  |
| **[CleanVul: Automatic Function-Level Vulnerability Detection in Code Commits Using LLM Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17274v5)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate identification of software vulnerabilities is crucial for system integrity. Vulnerability datasets, often derived from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) or directly from GitHub, are essential for training machine learning models to detect these security flaws. However, these datasets frequently suffer from significant noise, typically 40% to 75%, due primarily to the automatic and indiscriminate labeling of all changes in vulnerability-fixing commits (VFCs) as vulnerability-related. This misclassification occurs because not all changes in a commit aimed at fixing vulnerabilities pertain to security threats; many are routine updates like bug fixes or test improvements. This paper introduces the first methodology that uses the Large Language Model (LLM) with a heuristic enhancement to automatically identify vulnerability-fixing changes from VFCs, achieving an F1-score of 0.82. VulSifter was applied to a large-scale study, where we conducted a crawl of 127,063 repositories on GitHub, resulting in the acquisition of 5,352,105 commits. VulSifter involves utilizing an LLM to comprehend code semantics and contextual information, while applying heuristics to filter out unrelated changes. We then developed CleanVul, a high-quality dataset comprising 8,203 functions using our LLM heuristic enhancement approach, demonstrating Correctness (90.6%) comparable to established datasets such as SVEN and PrimeVul. To evaluate the CleanVul dataset, we conducted experiments focusing on fine-tuning various LLMs on CleanVul and other high-quality datasets. Evaluation results reveal that LLMs fine-tuned on CleanVul not only exhibit enhanced accuracy but also superior generalization capabilities compared to those trained on uncleaned datasets. Specifically, models trained on CleanVul and tested on PrimeVul achieve accuracy higher than those trained and tested exclusively on PrimeVul.</p></details> |  |
| **[VeriLeaky: Navigating IP Protection vs Utility in Fine-Tuning for LLM-Driven Verilog Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13116v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) offer significant potential for coding, yet fine-tuning (FT) with curated data is essential for niche languages like Verilog. Using proprietary intellectual property (IP) for FT presents a serious risk, as FT data can be leaked through LLM inference. This leads to a critical dilemma for design houses: seeking to build externally accessible LLMs offering competitive Verilog coding, how can they leverage in-house IP to enhance FT utility while ensuring IP protection? For the first time in the literature, we study this dilemma. Using LLaMA 3.1-8B, we conduct in-house FT on a baseline Verilog dataset (RTLCoder) supplemented with our own in-house IP, which is validated through multiple tape-outs. To rigorously assess IP leakage, we quantify structural similarity (AST/Dolos) and functional equivalence (Synopsys Formality) between generated codes and our in-house IP. We show that our IP can indeed be leaked, confirming the threat. As defense, we evaluate logic locking of Verilog codes (ASSURE). This offers some level of protection, yet reduces the IP's utility for FT and degrades the LLM's performance. Our study shows the need for novel strategies that are both effective and minimally disruptive to FT, an essential effort for enabling design houses to fully utilize their proprietary IP toward LLM-driven Verilog coding.</p></details> |  |

The first strategy employs direct diagonalization, while the second is based on an iterative solver. The BSE matrix is constructed with the Yambo code, and the two strategies are implemented by interfacing Yambo with the ScaLAPACK and ELPA libraries for direct diagonalization, and with the SLEPc library for the iterative approach. We consider both the hermitian (Tamm-Dancoff approximation) and pseudo-hermitian forms, addressing dense matrices of three different sizes. A description of the implementation is also provided, with details for the pseudo-hermitian case. Timing and memory utilization are analyzed on both CPU and GPU clusters. The CPU simulations are performed on a local cluster in Rome, while the GPU simulations are performed on the Leonardo HPC cluster of CINECA. Our results demonstrate that it is now feasible to handle dense BSE matrices of the order 10$^5$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Euro-Par 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[Code size constraints in b-symbol read channels: A bound analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10088v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In classical coding theory, error-correcting codes are designed to protect against errors occurring at individual symbol positions in a codeword. However, in practical storage and communication systems, errors often affect multiple adjacent symbols rather than single symbols independently. To address this, symbol-pair read channels were introduced \cite{Yuval2011}, and later generalized to $b$-symbol read channels \cite{yaakobi2016} to better model such error patterns. $b$-Symbol read channels generalize symbol-pair read channels to account for clustered errors in modern storage and communication systems. By developing bounds and efficient codes, researchers improve data reliability in applications such as storage devices, wireless networks, and DNA-based storage. Given integers $q$, $n$, $d$, and $b \geq 2$, let $A_b(n,d,q)$ denote the largest possible code size for which there exists a $q$-ary code of length $n$ with minimum $b$-symbol distance at least $d$. In \cite{chen2022}, various upper and lower bounds on $A_b(n,d,q)$ are given for $b=2$. In this paper, we generalize some of these bounds to the $b$-symbol read channels for $b>2$ and present several new bounds on $A_b(n,d,q)$. In particular, we establish the linear programming bound, a recurrence relation on $A_b(n,d,q)$, the Johnson bound (even), the restricted Johnson bound, the Gilbert-Varshamov-type bound, and the Elias bound for the metric of symbols $b$, $b\geq 2$. Furthermore, we provide examples demonstrating that the Gilbert-Varshamov bound we establish offers a stronger lower bound than the one presented in \cite{Song2018}. Additionally, we introduce an alternative approach to deriving the Sphere-packing and Plotkin bounds.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Vulnerabilities to Remediation: A Systematic Literature Review of LLMs in Code Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15004v3)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for automating various programming tasks, including security-related ones, such as detecting and fixing vulnerabilities. Despite their promising capabilities, when required to produce or modify pre-existing code, LLMs could introduce vulnerabilities unbeknown to the programmer. When analyzing code, they could miss clear vulnerabilities or signal nonexistent ones. In this Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we aim to investigate both the security benefits and potential drawbacks of using LLMs for a variety of code-related tasks. In particular, first we focus on the types of vulnerabilities that could be introduced by LLMs, when used for producing code. Second, we analyze the capabilities of LLMs to detect and fix vulnerabilities, in any given code, and how the prompting strategy of choice impacts their performance in these two tasks. Last, we provide an in-depth analysis on how data poisoning attacks on LLMs can impact performance in the aforementioned tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[VeriContaminated: Assessing LLM-Driven Verilog Coding for Data Contamination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13572v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized code generation, achieving exceptional results on various established benchmarking frameworks. However, concerns about data contamination - where benchmark data inadvertently leaks into pre-training or fine-tuning datasets - raise questions about the validity of these evaluations. While this issue is known, limiting the industrial adoption of LLM-driven software engineering, hardware coding has received little to no attention regarding these risks. For the first time, we analyze state-of-the-art (SOTA) evaluation frameworks for Verilog code generation (VerilogEval and RTLLM), using established methods for contamination detection (CCD and Min-K% Prob). We cover SOTA commercial and open-source LLMs (CodeGen2.5, Minitron 4b, Mistral 7b, phi-4 mini, LLaMA-{1,2,3.1}, GPT-{2,3.5,4o}, Deepseek-Coder, and CodeQwen 1.5), in baseline and fine-tuned models (RTLCoder and Verigen). Our study confirms that data contamination is a critical concern. We explore mitigations and the resulting trade-offs for code quality vs fairness (i.e., reducing contamination toward unbiased benchmarking).</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeRAG: Supportive Code Retrieval on Bigraph for Real-World Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10046v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in automated code generation, especially excelling in simple tasks such as generating standalone codes. Different from simple tasks, real-world code generation usually depends on specific programming environment (e.g., code repositories). It contains complex dependencies and domain knowledge, which is needed for LLMs when generating target code snippets. In this paper, we propose CodeRAG, a retrieval-augmented code generation (RAG) framework to comprehensively retrieve supportive codes for real-world code generation. Beginning with the requirement, CodeRAG first constructs a requirement graph for the current repository, and retrieves sub- and similar- requirement nodes of the target requirement on the graph. Meanwhile, it models the repository into a DS-code graph. CodeRAG then maps these relevant requirement nodes into their corresponding code nodes, and treats these code nodes as archors for LLM reasoning on DS-code graph. Finally, CodeRAG introduces a code-oriented agentic reasoning process, seamlessly allowing LLMs to reason and comprehensively retrieve for supportive codes which LLMs' need for generating correct programs. Experiments show that CodeRAG achieves significant improvements (i.e., increasing 40.90 and 37.79 Pass@1 on GPT-4o and Gemini-Pro on DevEval) compared to no RAG scenarios. Further tests on reasoning LLMs (i.e., QwQ-32B) confirm CodeRAG's adaptability and efficacy across various types of LLMs. In addition, CodeRAG outperforms commercial programming products such as Copilit and Cursor. We further investigate the performance of our framework on different dependency types, and observe that CodeRAG is superior in generating examples where target codes invoke predefined cross-file code snippets. These results demonstrate CodeRAG's potential in solving real-world repo-level coding challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[ClassEval-T: Evaluating Large Language Models in Class-Level Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06145v4)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have dramatically advanced the performance of automated code translation, making their computational accuracy score reach up to over 80% on many previous benchmarks. However, most code samples in these benchmarks are short, standalone, statement/method-level, and algorithmic, which is not aligned with practical coding tasks. Therefore, it is still unknown the actual capability of LLMs in translating code samples written for daily development. To achieve this, we construct a class-level code translation benchmark, ClassEval-T, and make the first attempt to extensively assess recent LLMs' performance on class-level code translation. ClassEval-T is extended from ClassEval, a well-known class-level Python code generation benchmark consisting of multiple practical coding topics, such as database operation and game design, and diverse contextual dependencies (e.g., fields, methods, and libraries). It cost us 360 person-hours to accomplish the manual migration to Java and C++ with complete code samples and associated test suites. Subsequently, we design three translation strategies (i.e., holistic, min-dependency, and standalone) for class-level code translations and evaluate eight recent LLMs of commercial, general, and code kinds in diverse families and sizes on ClassEval-T. Experimental results demonstrate a remarkable performance drop compared with the most widely studied method-level code translation benchmark, and obvious discrepancies among LLMs appear, showing the effectiveness of ClassEval-T in measuring recent LLMs. Afterwards, we further discuss the usage scenarios for diverse translation strategies and LLMs' ability to dependency awareness when translating class samples. Finally, 1,243 failure cases made by the best-performing LLM under test are analyzed and categorized in this paper for practical guidance and future enlightenment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constrained Error-Correcting Codes for Efficient DNA Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09950v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DNA synthesis is considered as one of the most expensive components in current DNA storage systems. In this paper, focusing on a common synthesis machine, which generates multiple DNA strands in parallel following a fixed supersequence,we propose constrained codes with polynomial-time encoding and decoding algorithms. Compared to the existing works, our codes simultaneously satisfy both l-runlength limited and {\epsilon}-balanced constraints. By enumerating all valid sequences, our codes achieve the maximum rate, matching the capacity. Additionally, we design constrained error-correcting codes capable of correcting one insertion or deletion in the obtained DNA sequence while still adhering to the constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explicit Folded Reed-Solomon and Multiplicity Codes Achieve Relaxed Generalized Singleton Bounds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15925v3)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we prove that explicit FRS codes and multiplicity codes achieve relaxed generalized Singleton bounds for list size $L\ge1.$ Specifically, we show the following: (1) FRS code of length $n$ and rate $R$ over the alphabet $\mathbb{F}_q^s$ with distinct evaluation points is $\left(\frac{L}{L+1}\left(1-\frac{sR}{s-L+1}\right),L\right)$ list-decodable (LD) for list size $L\in[s]$. (2) Multiplicity code of length $n$ and rate $R$ over the alphabet $\mathbb{F}_p^s$ with distinct evaluation points is $\left(\frac{L}{L+1}\left(1-\frac{sR}{s-L+1}\right),L\right)$ LD for list size $L\in[s]$. Choosing $s=\Theta(1/\epsilon^2)$ and $L=O(1/\epsilon)$, our results imply that both FRS codes and multiplicity codes achieve LD capacity $1-R-\epsilon$ with optimal list size $O(1/\epsilon)$. This exponentially improves the previous state of the art $(1/\epsilon)^{O(1/\epsilon)}$ established by Kopparty et. al. (FOCS 2018) and Tamo (IEEE TIT, 2024). In particular, our results on FRS codes fully resolve a open problem proposed by Guruswami and Rudra (STOC 2006). Furthermore, our results imply the first explicit constructions of $(1-R-\epsilon,O(1/\epsilon))$ LD codes of rate $R$ with poly-sized alphabets. Our method can also be extended to analyze the list-recoverability (LR) of FRS codes. We provide a tighter radius upper bound that FRS codes cannot be $(\frac{L+1-\ell}{L+1}(1-\frac{mR}{m-1})+o(1),\ell, L)$ LR where $m=\lceil\log_{\ell}{(L+1)}\rceil$. We conjecture this bound is almost tight when $L+1=\ell^a$ for any $a\in\mathbb{N}^{\ge 2}$. To give some evidences, we show FRS codes are $\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{sR}{s-2},2,3\right)$ LR, which proves the tightness in the smallest non-trivial case. Our bound refutes the possibility that FRS codes could achieve LR capacity $(1-R-\epsilon, \ell, O(\frac{\ell}{\epsilon}))$. This implies an intrinsic separation between LD and LR of FRS codes.</p></details> | STOC 2025 |

Large language models (LLMs) although have brought impressive improvement to source code tasks, do not directly generalize to assembly code due to the unique challenges of assembly: (1) the low information density of assembly and (2) the diverse optimizations in assembly code. To overcome these challenges, this work proposes a hierarchical attention mechanism that builds attention summaries to capture the semantics more effectively and designs contrastive learning objectives to train LLMs to learn assembly optimization. Equipped with these techniques, this work develops Nova, a generative LLM for assembly code. Nova outperforms existing techniques on binary code decompilation by up to 14.84 -- 21.58% (absolute percentage point improvement) higher Pass@1 and Pass@10, and outperforms the latest binary code similarity detection techniques by up to 6.17% Recall@1, showing promising abilities on both assembly generation and understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Migrating Code At Scale With LLMs At Google](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09691v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developers often evolve an existing software system by making internal changes, called migration. Moving to a new framework, changing implementation to improve efficiency, and upgrading a dependency to its latest version are examples of migrations. Migration is a common and typically continuous maintenance task undertaken either manually or through tooling. Certain migrations are labor intensive and costly, developers do not find the required work rewarding, and they may take years to complete. Hence, automation is preferred for such migrations. In this paper, we discuss a large-scale, costly and traditionally manual migration project at Google, propose a novel automated algorithm that uses change location discovery and a Large Language Model (LLM) to aid developers conduct the migration, report the results of a large case study, and discuss lessons learned. Our case study on 39 distinct migrations undertaken by three developers over twelve months shows that a total of 595 code changes with 93,574 edits have been submitted, where 74.45% of the code changes and 69.46% of the edits were generated by the LLM. The developers reported high satisfaction with the automated tooling, and estimated a 50% reduction on the total time spent on the migration compared to earlier manual migrations. Our results suggest that our automated, LLM-assisted workflow can serve as a model for similar initiatives.</p></details> |  |

In code generation, even minor errors can easily break the entire solution. Leveraging multiple sampled solutions can significantly improve the overall output quality. One effective way to enhance code generation is by pairing a code generation model with a reranker model, which selects the best solution from the generated samples. We propose a novel iterative self-training approach for self-training reranker models using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), aimed at improving both reranking accuracy and the overall code generation process. Unlike traditional PPO approaches, where the focus is on optimizing a generative model with a reward model, our approach emphasizes the development of a robust reward/reranking model. This model improves the quality of generated code through reranking and addresses problems and errors that the reward model might overlook during PPO alignment with the reranker. Our method iteratively refines the training dataset by re-evaluating outputs, identifying high-scoring negative examples, and incorporating them into the training loop, that boosting model performance. Our evaluation on the MultiPL-E dataset demonstrates that our 13.4B parameter model outperforms a 33B model in code generation quality while being three times faster. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to GPT-4 and surpasses it in one programming language.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ECIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bounds and Optimal Constructions of Generalized Merge-Convertible Codes for Code Conversion into LRCs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09580v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Error-correcting codes are essential for ensuring fault tolerance in modern distributed data storage systems. However, in practice, factors such as the failure rates of storage devices can vary significantly over time, resulting in changes to the optimal code parameters. To reduce storage costs while maintaining efficiency, Maturana and Rashmi introduced a theoretical framework known as code conversion, which enables dynamic adjustment of code parameters according to device performance. In this paper, we focus exclusively on the bounds and constructions of generalized merge-convertible codes. First, we establish a new lower bound on the access cost when the final code is an $(r,\delta)$-LRC. This bound unifies and generalizes all previously known bounds for merge conversion where the initial and final codes are either an LRC or an MDS code. We then construct a family of access-optimal MDS convertible codes by leveraging subgroups of the automorphism group of a rational function field. It is worth noting that our construction is also per-symbol read access-optimal. Next, we further extend our MDS-based construction to design access-optimal convertible codes for the conversion between $(r,\delta)$-LRCs. Finally, using the parity-check matrix approach, we present a construction of access-optimal convertible codes that enable merge conversion from MDS codes to an $(r,\delta)$-LRC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first explicit optimal construction of code conversion between MDS codes and LRCs. All of our constructions are over finite fields whose sizes grow linearly with the code length.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Rate-Immediacy Barrier in Explicit Tree Code Constructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09388v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the introduction of tree codes by Schulman (STOC 1993), explicit construction of such codes has remained a notorious challenge. While the construction of asymptotically-good explicit tree codes continues to be elusive, a work by Cohen, Haeupler and Schulman (STOC 2018), as well as the state-of-the-art construction by Ben Yaacov, Cohen, and Yankovitz (STOC 2022) have achieved codes with rate $\Omega(1/\log\log n)$, exponentially improving upon the original construction of Evans, Klugerman and Schulman from 1994. All of these constructions rely, at least in part, on increasingly sophisticated methods of combining (block) error-correcting codes. In this work, we identify a fundamental barrier to constructing tree codes using current techniques. We introduce a key property, which we call immediacy, that, while not required by the original definition of tree codes, is shared by all known constructions and inherently arises from recursive combinations of error-correcting codes. Our main technical contribution is the proof of a rate-immediacy tradeoff, which, in particular, implies that any tree code with constant distance and non-trivial immediacy must necessarily have vanishing rate. By applying our rate-immediacy tradeoff to existing constructions, we establish that their known rate analyses are essentially optimal. More broadly, our work highlights the need for fundamentally new ideas--beyond the recursive use of error-correcting codes--to achieve substantial progress in explicitly constructing asymptotically-good tree codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Type-Constrained Code Generation with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09246v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable success in code generation. However, they still frequently produce uncompilable output because their next-token inference procedure does not model formal aspects of code. Although constrained decoding is a promising approach to alleviate this issue, it has only been applied to handle either domain-specific languages or syntactic language features. This leaves typing errors, which are beyond the domain of syntax and generally hard to adequately constrain. To address this challenge, we introduce a type-constrained decoding approach that leverages type systems to guide code generation. We develop novel prefix automata for this purpose and introduce a sound approach to enforce well-typedness based on type inference and a search over inhabitable types. We formalize our approach on a simply-typed language and extend it to TypeScript to demonstrate practicality. Our evaluation on HumanEval shows that our approach reduces compilation errors by more than half and increases functional correctness in code synthesis, translation, and repair tasks across LLMs of various sizes and model families, including SOTA open-weight models with more than 30B parameters.</p></details> |  |

In this article, we find generators for trace dual spaces of different families of $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. In particular, given the field extension $\mathbb{F}_q\leq \mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ with $q$ an odd prime power, we determine the trace Euclidean and trace Hermitian dual codes for the general $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear cyclic $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$-code. In addition, we also determine the trace Euclidean and trace Hermitian duals for general $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear skew cyclic $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$-codes, which are defined to be left $\mathbb{F}_q[X]$-submodules of $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[X;\sigma]/(X^n-1)$, where $\sigma$ denotes the Frobenius automorphism and $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[X;\sigma]$ the induced skew polynomial ring.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Code-Craft: Hierarchical Graph-Based Code Summarization for Enhanced Context Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08975v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and navigating large-scale codebases remains a significant challenge in software engineering. Existing methods often treat code as flat text or focus primarily on local structural relationships, limiting their ability to provide holistic, context-aware information retrieval. We present Hierarchical Code Graph Summarization (HCGS), a novel approach that constructs a multi-layered representation of a codebase by generating structured summaries in a bottom-up fashion from a code graph. HCGS leverages the Language Server Protocol for language-agnostic code analysis and employs a parallel level-based algorithm for efficient summary generation. Through extensive evaluation on five diverse codebases totaling 7,531 functions, HCGS demonstrates significant improvements in code retrieval accuracy, achieving up to 82 percentage relative improvement in top-1 retrieval precision for large codebases like libsignal (27.15 percentage points), and perfect Pass@3 scores for smaller repositories. The system's hierarchical approach consistently outperforms traditional code-only retrieval across all metrics, with particularly substantial gains in larger, more complex codebases where understanding function relationships is crucial.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optuna vs Code Llama: Are LLMs a New Paradigm for Hyperparameter Tuning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06006v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal hyperparameter selection is critical for maximizing neural network performance, especially as models grow in complexity. This work investigates the viability of leveraging large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization by fine-tuning a parameter-efficient version of Code Llama using LoRA. The adapted LLM is capable of generating accurate and efficient hyperparameter recommendations tailored to diverse neural network architectures. Unlike traditional approaches such as Optuna, which rely on computationally intensive trial-and-error procedures, our method achieves competitive or superior results in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our findings demonstrate that LLM-based optimization not only matches the performance of state-of-the-art techniques like Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) but also substantially accelerates the tuning process. This positions LLMs as a promising alternative for rapid experimentation, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and mobile platforms, where computational efficiency is essential. In addition to improved efficiency, the method offers time savings and consistent performance across various tasks, highlighting its robustness and generalizability. All generated hyperparameters are included in the LEMUR Neural Network (NN) Dataset, which is publicly available and serves as an open-source benchmark for hyperparameter optimization research.</p></details> |  |

We are interested in finetuning small, specialized LLMs for this purpose, but collecting datasets of task-program pairs specific to each robot is time-consuming and expensive. While approaches such as SELF-INSTRUCT and EVOL-INSTRUCT are capable of generating novel tasks given a few examples, they are unable to provide the corresponding programs that correctly abide by physical-world and robot-constraints using the provided programming interface. Using a simulator is a natural potential solution to checking for such constraints, but building simulation environments that can handle arbitrary tasks and their necessary objects and locations, is challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce ROBO-INSTRUCT, which synthesizes task-specific simulation environments on the fly during program execution, by opportunistically inferring entity properties and enforcing corresponding constraints based on how the entities are used in the task program. Additionally, ROBO-INSTRUCT integrates an LLM-aided post-processing procedure to refine instructions for better alignment with robot programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ROBO-INSTRUCT across multiple LLMs, showing that our fine-tuned models outperform all baseline methods and even match or surpass the performance of several larger and proprietary models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards an Understanding of Context Utilization in Code Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08734v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code intelligence is an emerging domain in software engineering, aiming to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of various code-related tasks. Recent research suggests that incorporating contextual information beyond the basic original task inputs (i.e., source code) can substantially enhance model performance. Such contextual signals may be obtained directly or indirectly from sources such as API documentation or intermediate representations like abstract syntax trees can significantly improve the effectiveness of code intelligence. Despite growing academic interest, there is a lack of systematic analysis of context in code intelligence. To address this gap, we conduct an extensive literature review of 146 relevant studies published between September 2007 and August 2024. Our investigation yields four main contributions. (1) A quantitative analysis of the research landscape, including publication trends, venues, and the explored domains; (2) A novel taxonomy of context types used in code intelligence; (3) A task-oriented analysis investigating context integration strategies across diverse code intelligence tasks; (4) A critical evaluation of evaluation methodologies for context-aware methods. Based on these findings, we identify fundamental challenges in context utilization in current code intelligence systems and propose a research roadmap that outlines key opportunities for future research.</p></details> |  |

Specialized agents (Reader, Searcher, Writer, Verifier, Orchestrator) then collaboratively generate documentation.

Identifying EVM-Inequivalent Code Smells in Multi-chain Reuse Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07589v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the development of Solidity contracts on Ethereum, more developers are reusing them on other compatible blockchains. However, developers may overlook the differences between the designs of the blockchain system, such as the Gas Mechanism and Consensus Protocol, leading to the same contracts on different blockchains not being able to achieve consistent execution as on Ethereum. This inconsistency reveals design flaws in reused contracts, exposing code smells that hinder code reusability, and we define this inconsistency as EVM-Inequivalent Code Smells. In this paper, we conducted the first empirical study to reveal the causes and characteristics of EVM-Inequivalent Code Smells. To ensure the identified smells reflect real developer concerns, we collected and analyzed 1,379 security audit reports and 326 Stack Overflow posts related to reused contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains, such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Polygon. Using the open card sorting method, we defined six types of EVM-Inequivalent Code Smells. For automated detection, we developed a tool named EquivGuard. It employs static taint analysis to identify key paths from different patterns and uses symbolic execution to verify path reachability. Our analysis of 905,948 contracts across six major blockchains shows that EVM-Inequivalent Code Smells are widespread, with an average prevalence of 17.70%. While contracts with code smells do not necessarily lead to financial loss and attacks, their high prevalence and significant asset management underscore the potential threats of reusing these smelly Ethereum contracts. Thus, developers are advised to abandon Copy-and-Paste programming practices and detect EVM-Inequivalent Code Smells before reusing Ethereum contracts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ISSTA2025</p></details> |

First, we generalize previous results to multiplicity rational codes by considering modular reductions with respect to prime power moduli. Then, using hybrid analysis techniques, we extend our approach to vectors of fractions that may present bad primes. Our contributions include: a decoding algorithm for simultaneous rational number reconstruction with multiplicities, a rigorous analysis of the algorithm's failure probability that generalizes several previous results, an extension to a hybrid model handling situations where not all errors can be assumed random, and a unified approach to handle bad primes within multiplicities. The theoretical results provide a comprehensive probabilistic analysis of reconstruction failure in these more complex scenarios, advancing the state of the art in error correction for rational number codes.</p></details> |  |

Following the tremendous success of large language models (LLMs), researchers have begun to explore utilizing LLMs for generating RTL code. However, current studies primarily focus on generating simple single modules, which can not meet the demands in real world. In fact, due to challenges in managing long-context RTL code and complex cross-file dependencies, existing solutions cannot handle large-scale Verilog repositories in practical hardware development. As the first endeavor to exclusively adapt LLMs for large-scale RTL development, we propose RTLRepoCoder, a groundbreaking solution that incorporates specific fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for repository-level Verilog code completion. Open-source Verilog repositories from the real world, along with an extended context size, are used for domain-specific fine-tuning. The optimized RAG system improves the information density of the input context by retrieving relevant code snippets. Tailored optimizations for RAG are carried out, including the embedding model, the cross-file context splitting strategy, and the chunk size. Our solution achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmark, significantly surpassing GPT-4 and advanced domain-specific LLMs on Edit Similarity and Exact Match rate. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our approach and offer insights for future work.</p></details> |  |

With the aid of B\.ezier extraction technique, a derived explicit stiffness matrix computation formula is applied to all B-spline IGA elements with rectangular shape under linear elasticity assumption. Using the aforementioned explicit formula, the stiffness matrix calculation and updating of IGA are significantly simplified, which leads to the current ITO code implemented only in one main function without calling subroutines, such as IGA mesh generation and Gaussian quadrature. Both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) cases are taken into consideration, which result into iga_top120 and iga_top3D257 MATLAB codes for 2D and 3D design problems. Numerical examples validate the effectiveness of our open-source codes, with several user-defined input parameters basically identical to those used in top88 and top3D. Therefore, iga_top120 and iga_top3D257 provide an effective entry for the code transforming from FEM-based TO into ITO.</p></details> |  |

Existing code search datasets face limitations: they rely on human annotators who assess code primarily through semantic understanding rather than functional verification, leading to potential inaccuracies and scalability issues. Additionally, current evaluation metrics often overlook the multi-choice nature of code search. This paper introduces CoSQA+, pairing high-quality queries from CoSQA with multiple suitable codes. We develop an automated pipeline featuring multiple model-based candidate selections and the novel test-driven agent annotation system.

However, the potential of code summarization in the Computer Security Area still remains explored. Can we generate a code summary of a code snippet for its security intention? Thus, this work proposes an innovative large-scale multi-perspective Code Intent Summary Dataset named BADS , aiming to increase the understanding of a given code snippet and reduce the risk in the code developing process. The procedure of establishing a dataset can be divided into four steps: First, we collect samples of codes with known vulnerabilities as well as code generated by AI from multiple sources. Second, we do the data clean and format unification, then do the data combination. Third, we utilize the LLM to automatically Annotate the code snippet. Last, We do the human evaluation to double-check. The dataset contains X code examples which cover Y categories of vulnerability. Our data are from Z open-source projects and CVE entries, and compared to existing work, our dataset not only contains original code but also code function summary and security intent summary, providing context information for research in code security analysis. All information is in CSV format. The contributions of this paper are four-fold: the establishment of a high-quality, multi-perspective Code Intent Summary Dataset; an innovative method in data collection and processing; A new multi-perspective code analysis framework that promotes cross-disciplinary research in the fields of software engineering and cybersecurity; improving the practicality and scalability of the research outcomes by considering the code length limitations in real-world applications. Our dataset and related tools have been publicly released on GitHub.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Model for Verilog Generation with Code-Structure-Guided Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18271v3)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have sparked significant interest in the automatic generation of Register Transfer Level (RTL) designs, particularly using Verilog. Current research on this topic primarily focuses on pre-training and instruction tuning, but the effectiveness of these methods is constrained by the limited availability of training data, as public Verilog code is far less abundant than software code. In particular, these methods struggle to effectively capture Verilog parallel code structures, which fundamentally differ from the imperative, sequential control flow typical in most software programming languages. This paper introduces VeriSeek, an LLM enhanced by reinforcement learning using a limited amount of high-quality training data to achieve high Verilog code generation performance. Our reinforcement learning approach employs code structure information as feedback signals to refine the pre-trained model, enabling it to effectively learn important patterns from Verilog code with parallel structures. Experiments show that VeriSeek outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, we establish a condition under which a linear code has a trivial intersection with another linear code (or its Galois dual). Furthermore, we provide a condition for reversibility and propose a generator matrix formula for the largest reversible subcode of any linear code. We then focus on the comprehensive class of multi-twisted (MT) codes, which are naturally and more effectively represented using generator polynomial matrices (GPMs). We prove that the reversed code of an MT code remains MT and derive an explicit formula for its GPM. Additionally, we examine the intersection of a pair of MT codes, possibly with different shift constants, and demonstrate that this intersection is not necessarily MT. However, when the intersection admits an MT structure, we propose the corresponding shift constants. We also establish a GPM formula for the intersection of a pair of MT codes with the same shift constants. This result enables us to derive a GPM formula for the intersection of an MT code and the Galois dual of another MT code. Finally, we examine conditions for various properties on MT codes. Perhaps most importantly, the necessary and sufficient conditions for an MT code to be Galois self-orthogonal, Galois dual-containing, Galois linear complementary dual (LCD), or reversible.</p></details> |  |

We propose an upper bound on the redundancy of these codes, based on the minimum possible length of an error-correcting code with a given number of codewords and minimum distance. Additionally, we provide a sufficient optimality condition for the function-correcting codes when $\lambda = 4$. We also demonstrate that any function can be represented as a $\rho$-locally $\lambda$-function, illustrating this with a representation of Hamming weight distribution functions. Furthermore, we present another construction of function-correcting codes for Hamming weight distribution functions.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Approach to Hyperbolic Quantum Error Correction Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07800v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperbolic quantum error correction codes (HQECCs) leverage the unique geometric properties of hyperbolic space to enhance the capabilities and performance of quantum error correction. By embedding qubits in hyperbolic lattices, HQECCs achieve higher encoding rates and improved error thresholds compared to conventional Euclidean codes. Building on recent advances in hyperbolic crystallography, we present a systematic framework for constructing HQECCs. As a key component of this framework, we develop a novel algorithm for computing all plaquette cycles and logical operators associated with a given HQECC. To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we utilize this framework to simulate two HQECCs based respectively on two relevant examples of hyperbolic tilings. In the process, we evaluate key code parameters such as encoding rate, error threshold, and code distance for different sub-lattices. This work establishes a solid foundation for a systematic and comprehensive analysis of HQECCs, paving the way for the practical implementation of HQECCs in the pursuit of robust quantum error correction strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures; submitted to Quantum Algorithms Technical Papers Track (QALG) of IEEE Quantum Week 2025 (QCE25) as submission no. 179; link to GitHub repository with corresponding code is included within manuscript</p></details> |
| **[Zero-Shot Cross-Domain Code Search without Fine-Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07740v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code search aims to retrieve semantically relevant code snippets for natural language queries. While pre-trained language models (PLMs) have shown remarkable performance in this task, they struggle in cross-domain scenarios, often requiring costly fine-tuning or facing performance drops in zero-shot settings. RAPID, which generates synthetic data for model fine-tuning, is currently the only effective method for zero-shot cross-domain code search. Despite its effectiveness, RAPID demands substantial computational resources for fine-tuning and needs to maintain specialized models for each domain, underscoring the need for a zero-shot, fine-tuning-free approach for cross-domain code search. The key to tackling zero-shot cross-domain code search lies in bridging the gaps among domains. In this work, we propose to break the query-code matching process of code search into two simpler tasks: query-comment matching and code-code matching. Our empirical study reveals the strong complementarity among the three matching schemas in zero-shot cross-domain settings, i.e., query-code, query-comment, and code-code matching. Based on the findings, we propose CodeBridge, a zero-shot, fine-tuning-free approach for cross-domain code search. Specifically, CodeBridge uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate comments and pseudo-code, then combines query-code, query-comment, and code-code matching via PLM-based similarity scoring and sampling-based fusion. Experimental results show that our approach outperforms the state-of-the-art PLM-based code search approaches, i.e., CoCoSoDa and UniXcoder, by an average of 21.4% and 24.9% in MRR, respectively, across three datasets. Our approach also yields results that are better than or comparable to those of the zero-shot cross-domain code search approach RAPID, which requires costly fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Token to Line: Enhancing Code Generation with a Long-Term Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07433v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly promoted the development of code generation task, sparking a surge in pertinent literature. Current research is hindered by redundant generation results and a tendency to overfit local patterns in the short term. Although existing studies attempt to alleviate the issue by adopting a multi-token prediction strategy, there remains limited focus on choosing the appropriate processing length for generations. By analyzing the attention between tokens during the generation process of LLMs, it can be observed that the high spikes of the attention scores typically appear at the end of lines. This insight suggests that it is reasonable to treat each line of code as a fundamental processing unit and generate them sequentially. Inspired by this, we propose the \textbf{LSR-MCTS} algorithm, which leverages MCTS to determine the code line-by-line and select the optimal path. Further, we integrate a self-refine mechanism at each node to enhance diversity and generate higher-quality programs through error correction. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analyses on three public coding benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art performance approaches.</p></details> |  |

Coding is highly labor intensive, making it infeasible for most researchers to conduct exhaustive thematic analyses of large corpora. We utilize few-shot prompting with higher quality codes generated on semantically similar passages to enhance the quality of the codes while utilizing a cheap, more easily scalable model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prism: Dynamic and Flexible Benchmarking of LLMs Code Generation with Monte Carlo Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05500v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has outpaced traditional evaluation methods. Static benchmarks fail to capture the depth and breadth of LLM capabilities and eventually become obsolete, while most dynamic approaches either rely too heavily on LLM-based evaluation or remain constrained by predefined test sets. We introduce Prism, a flexible, dynamic benchmarking framework designed for comprehensive LLM assessment. Prism builds on three key components: (1) a tree-based state representation that models evaluation as a Markov Decision Process, (2) a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm adapted to uncover challenging evaluation scenarios, and (3) a multi-agent evaluation pipeline that enables simultaneous assessment of diverse capabilities. To ensure robust evaluation, Prism integrates structural measurements of tree exploration patterns with performance metrics across difficulty levels, providing detailed diagnostics of error patterns, test coverage, and solution approaches. Through extensive experiments on five state-of-the-art LLMs, we analyze how model architecture and scale influence code generation performance across varying task difficulties. Our results demonstrate Prism's effectiveness as a dynamic benchmark that evolves with model advancements while offering deeper insights into their limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code Generation with Small Language Models: A Deep Evaluation on Codeforces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07343v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated capabilities in code generation, potentially boosting developer productivity. However, their widespread adoption remains limited by high computational costs, significant energy demands, and security risks such as data leakage and adversarial attacks. As a lighter-weight alternative, Small Language Models (SLMs) offer faster inference, lower deployment overhead, and better adaptability to domain-specific tasks, making them an attractive option for real-world applications. While prior research has benchmarked LLMs on competitive programming tasks, such evaluations often focus narrowly on metrics like Elo scores or pass rates, overlooking deeper insights into model behavior, failure patterns, and problem diversity. Furthermore, the potential of SLMs to tackle complex tasks such as competitive programming remains underexplored. In this study, we benchmark five open SLMs - LLAMA 3.2 3B, GEMMA 2 9B, GEMMA 3 12B, DEEPSEEK-R1 14B, and PHI-4 14B - across 280 Codeforces problems spanning Elo ratings from 800 to 2100 and covering 36 distinct topics. All models were tasked with generating Python solutions. PHI-4 14B achieved the best performance among SLMs, with a pass@3 of 63.6%, approaching the proprietary O3-MINI-HIGH (86.8%). In addition, we evaluated PHI-4 14B on C++ and found that combining outputs from both Python and C++ increases its aggregated pass@3 to 73.6%. A qualitative analysis of PHI-4 14B's incorrect outputs revealed that some failures were due to minor implementation issues - such as handling edge cases or correcting variable initialization - rather than deeper reasoning flaws.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Accurately Do Large Language Models Understand Code?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04372v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used in post-development tasks such as code repair and testing. A key factor in these tasks' success is the model's deep understanding of code. However, the extent to which LLMs truly understand code remains largely unevaluated. Quantifying code comprehension is challenging due to its abstract nature and the lack of a standardized metric. Previously, this was assessed through developer surveys, which are not feasible for evaluating LLMs. Existing LLM benchmarks focus primarily on code generation, fundamentally different from code comprehension. Additionally, fixed benchmarks quickly become obsolete as they become part of the training data. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical investigation into LLMs' ability to understand code. Inspired by mutation testing, we use an LLM's fault-finding ability as a proxy for its deep code understanding. This approach is based on the insight that a model capable of identifying subtle functional discrepancies must understand the code well. We inject faults in real-world programs and ask the LLM to localize them, ensuring the specifications suffice for fault localization. Next, we apply semantic-preserving code mutations (SPMs) to the faulty programs and test whether the LLMs still locate the faults, verifying their confidence in code understanding. We evaluate nine popular LLMs on 600,010 debugging tasks from 670 Java and 637 Python programs. We find that LLMs lose the ability to debug the same bug in 78% of faulty programs when SPMs are applied, indicating a shallow understanding of code and reliance on features irrelevant to semantics. We also find that LLMs understand code earlier in the program better than later. This suggests that LLMs' code comprehension remains tied to lexical and syntactic features due to tokenization designed for natural languages, which overlooks code semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently Under Review.

| **[DeCoMa: Detecting and Purifying Code Dataset Watermarks through Dual Channel Code Abstraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07002v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking is a technique to help identify the source of data points, which can be used to help prevent the misuse of protected datasets. Existing methods on code watermarking, leveraging the idea from the backdoor research, embed stealthy triggers as watermarks.Despite their high resilience against dilution attacks and backdoor detections, the robustness has not been fully evaluated. To fill this gap, we propose DeCoMa, a dual-channel approach to Detect and purify Code dataset waterMarks.To overcome the high barrier created by the stealthy and hidden nature of code watermarks, DeCoMa leverages dual-channel constraints on code to generalize and map code samples into standardized templates. Subsequently, DeCoMa extracts hidden watermarks by identifying outlier associations between paired elements within the standardized templates. Finally, DeCoMa purifies the watermarked dataset by removing all samples containing the detected watermark, enabling the silent appropriation of protected code. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of DeCoMa, covering 14 types of code watermarks and 3 representative intelligent code tasks (a total of 14 scenarios). Experimental results demonstrate that DeCoMa achieves a stable recall of 100% in 14 code watermark detection scenarios, significantly outperforming the baselines. Additionally, DeCoMa effectively attacks code watermarks with embedding rates as low as 0.1%, while maintaining comparable model performance after training on the purified dataset. Furthermore, as DeCoMa requires no model training for detection, it achieves substantially higher efficiency than all baselines, with a speedup ranging from 31.5 to 130.9X. The results call for more advanced watermarking techniques for code models, while DeCoMa can serve as a baseline for future evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ISSTA 2025.

To bridge this gap, we introduce CodeMMLU, a comprehensive multiple-choice benchmark designed to evaluate the depth of software and code comprehension in LLMs. CodeMMLU includes nearly 20,000 questions spanning diverse domains, including code analysis, defect detection, and software engineering principles across multiple programming languages. Unlike traditional benchmarks that emphasize code generation, CodeMMLU assesses a model's ability to reason about programs across a wide-range of tasks such as code repair, execution reasoning, and fill-in-the-blank challenges. Our extensive evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle with CodeMMLU, highlighting significant gaps in comprehension beyond generation. By emphasizing the essential connection between code understanding and effective AI-assisted development, CodeMMLU provides a critical resource for advancing more reliable and capable coding assistants.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Source Code Representations for Machine Learning-Based Cybersecurity Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.10646v2)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning techniques for cybersecurity-related software engineering tasks are becoming increasingly popular. The representation of source code is a key portion of the technique that can impact the way the model is able to learn the features of the source code. With an increasing number of these techniques being developed, it is valuable to see the current state of the field to better understand what exists and what is not there yet. This article presents a study of these existing machine learning based approaches and demonstrates what type of representations were used for different cybersecurity tasks and programming languages. Additionally, we study what types of models are used with different representations. We have found that graph-based representations are the most popular category of representation, and tokenizers and Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) are the two most popular representations overall (e.g., AST and tokenizers are the representations with the highest count of papers, whereas graph-based representations is the category with the highest count of papers). We also found that the most popular cybersecurity task is vulnerability detection, and the language that is covered by the most techniques is C. Finally, we found that sequence-based models are the most popular category of models, and Support Vector Machines are the most popular model overall.</p></details> |  |
| **[FeedbackEval: A Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models in Feedback-Driven Code Repair Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06939v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code repair is a fundamental task in software development, facilitating efficient bug resolution and software maintenance. Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated considerable potential in automated code repair, their ability to comprehend and effectively leverage diverse types of feedback remains insufficiently understood. To bridge this gap, we introduce FeedbackEval, a systematic benchmark for evaluating LLMs' feedback comprehension and performance in code repair tasks. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study on five state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-4o, Claude-3.5, Gemini-1.5, GLM-4, and Qwen2.5, to evaluate their behavior under both single-iteration and iterative code repair settings. Our results show that structured feedback, particularly in the form of test feedback, leads to the highest repair success rates, while unstructured feedback proves significantly less effective. Iterative feedback further enhances repair performance, though the marginal benefit diminishes after two or three rounds. Moreover, prompt structure is shown to be critical: incorporating docstrings, contextual information, and explicit guidelines substantially improves outcomes, whereas persona-based, chain-of-thought, and few-shot prompting strategies offer limited benefits in single-iteration scenarios. This work introduces a robust benchmark and delivers practical insights to advance the understanding and development of feedback-driven code repair using LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Random Reed-Solomon Codes and Random Linear Codes are Locally Equivalent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02238v6)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We establish an equivalence between two important random ensembles of linear codes: random linear codes (RLCs) and random Reed-Solomon (RS) codes. Specifically, we show that these models exhibit identical behavior with respect to key combinatorial properties -- such as list-decodability and list-recoverability -- when the alphabet size is sufficiently large. We introduce monotone-decreasing local coordinate-wise linear (LCL) properties, a new class of properties tailored for the large alphabet regime. This class encompasses list-decodability, list-recoverability, and their average-weight variants. We develop a framework for analyzing these properties and prove a threshold theorem for RLCs: for any LCL property ${P}$, there exists a threshold rate $R_{P}$ such that RLCs are likely to satisfy ${P}$ when $R < R_{P}$ and unlikely to do so when $R > R_{P}$. We extend this threshold theorem to random RS codes and show that they share the same threshold $ R_{P} $, thereby establishing the equivalence between the two ensembles and enabling a unified analysis of list-recoverability and related properties. Applying our framework, we compute the threshold rate for list-decodability, proving that both random RS codes and RLCs achieve the generalized Singleton bound. This recovers a recent result of Alrabiah, Guruswami, and Li (2023) via elementary methods. Additionally, we prove an upper bound on the list-recoverability threshold and conjecture that this bound is tight. Our approach suggests a plausible pathway for proving this conjecture and thereby pinpointing the list-recoverability parameters of both models. Indeed, following the release of a prior version of this paper, Li and Shagrithaya (2025) used our equivalence theorem to show that random RS codes are near-optimally list-recoverable.</p></details> |  |

Then, we provide a general construction of convertible codes with optimal access cost which shows that those codes can be with super-linear length or maximum repairable property. Additionally, employing the known locally repairable codes with super-linear length or maximum repairable property, we provide explicit constructions of convertible codes with super-linear length or maximum repairable property.</p></details> |  |

This model is based on our work published in 2018(Inazawa, 2018), which we have refined and extended in this work. With the recent advancements in deep learning and large language model (LLM)-based AI technologies (generative AI), it can be considered that methodologies for the learning are becoming increasingly well-established. In the future, we expect to see further research on memory using models based on Transformers (Vaswani, et. al., 2017, Rae, et. al., 2020), but in this paper we propose a simpler and more powerful model of memory and recall in neural networks. The advantage of storing patterns in a neural network lies in its ability to recall the original pattern even when an incomplete version is presented. The patterns we have produced for use in this study have been QR code (DENSO WAVE, 1994), which has become widely used as an information transmission tool in recent years.</p></details> | 14 pages, 6 figures |

However, increasing model size and data volume for performance gains also raises computational demands and risks of overfitting. Addressing these challenges, we present RETROcode, a novel adaptation of the RETRO architecture \cite{RETRO} for sequence-to-sequence models, utilizing a large code database as an auxiliary scaling method. This approach, diverging from simply enlarging model and dataset sizes, allows RETROcode to leverage a vast code database for prediction, enhancing the model's efficiency by integrating extensive memory. Our findings indicate that RETROcode not only outperforms similar-sized traditional architectures on test sets but also approaches the effectiveness of the much larger Codex model, despite being trained from scratch on a substantially smaller dataset.</p></details> |  |

Despite progress in fixed dimensions (e.g., dimension 4 codes by Ding and Tang \cite{Ding2020}), constructing NMDS codes with arbitrary dimensions supporting $t$-designs ($t\geq 2$) has remained open. In this paper, we construct two infinite families of NMDS codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ for any prime power $q$ with flexible dimensions and determine their weight distributions. Further, two additional families with arbitrary dimensions over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$ supporting $2$-designs and $3$-designs, and their weight distributions are obtained. Our results fully generalize prior fixed-dimension works~\cite{DingY2024,Heng2023,Heng20231,Xu2022}, and affirmatively settle the Heng-Wang conjecture \cite{Heng2023} on the existence of NMDS codes with flexible parameters supporting $2$-designs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unbounded Error Correcting Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04803v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional error-correcting codes (ECCs) assume a fixed message length, but many scenarios involve ongoing or indefinite transmissions where the message length is not known in advance. For example, when streaming a video, the user should be able to fix a fraction of errors that occurred before any point in time. We introduce unbounded error-correcting codes (unbounded codes), a natural generalization of ECCs that supports arbitrarily long messages without a predetermined length. An unbounded code with rate $R$ and distance $\varepsilon$ ensures that for every sufficiently large $k$, the message prefix of length $Rk$ can be recovered from the code prefix of length $k$ even if an adversary corrupts up to an $\varepsilon$ fraction of the symbols in this code prefix. We study unbounded codes over binary alphabets in the regime of small error fraction $\varepsilon$, establishing nearly tight upper and lower bounds on their optimal rate. Our main results show that: (1) The optimal rate of unbounded codes satisfies $R<1-\Omega(\sqrt{\varepsilon})$ and $R>1-O(\sqrt{\varepsilon \log \log(1/\varepsilon)})$. (2) Surprisingly, our construction is inherently non-linear, as we prove that linear unbounded codes achieve a strictly worse rate of $R=1-\Theta(\sqrt{\varepsilon \log(1/\varepsilon)})$. (3) In the setting of random noise, unbounded codes achieve the same optimal rate as standard ECCs, $R=1-\Theta(\varepsilon \log(1/\varepsilon))$. These results demonstrate fundamental differences between standard and unbounded codes.</p></details> |  |

However, although LLMs show promising cross-lingual alignment in IE, a significant imbalance across languages persists, highlighting an underlying deficiency. To address this, we propose KnowCoder-X, a powerful code LLM with advanced cross-lingual and multilingual capabilities for universal information extraction. Firstly, it standardizes the representation of multilingual schemas using Python classes, ensuring a consistent ontology across different languages. Then, IE across languages is formulated as a unified code generation task. Secondly, we enhance the model's cross-lingual transferability through IE cross-lingual alignment instruction tuning on a translated instance prediction task we proposed. During this phase, we also construct a high-quality and diverse bilingual IE parallel dataset with 257k samples, called ParallelNER, synthesized by our proposed robust three-stage pipeline, with manual annotation to ensure quality. Although without training in 29 unseen languages, KnowCoder-X surpasses ChatGPT by $30.17\%$ and SoTA by $20.03\%$, thereby demonstrating superior cross-lingual IE capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations on 64 IE benchmarks in Chinese and English under various settings demonstrate that KnowCoder-X significantly enhances cross-lingual IE transfer through boosting the IE alignment.

| **[CodeEditorBench: Evaluating Code Editing Capability of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.03543v3)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) for code are rapidly evolving, with code editing emerging as a critical capability. We introduce CodeEditorBench, an evaluation framework designed to rigorously assess the performance of LLMs in code editing tasks, including debugging, translating, polishing, and requirement switching. Unlike existing benchmarks focusing solely on code generation, CodeEditorBench emphasizes real-world scenarios and practical aspects of software development. We curate diverse coding challenges and scenarios from five sources, covering various programming languages, complexity levels, and editing tasks. Evaluation of 19 LLMs reveals that closed-source models (particularly Gemini-Ultra and GPT-4), outperform open-source models in CodeEditorBench, highlighting differences in model performance based on problem types and prompt sensitivities. CodeEditorBench aims to catalyze advancements in LLMs by providing a robust platform for assessing code editing capabilities. We will release all prompts and datasets to enable the community to expand the dataset and benchmark emerging LLMs. By introducing CodeEditorBench, we contribute to the advancement of LLMs in code editing and provide a valuable resource for researchers and practitioners.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying and Replicating Code Patterns Driving Performance Regressions in Software Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05851v1)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Performance regressions negatively impact execution time and memory usage of software systems. Nevertheless, there is a lack of systematic methods to evaluate the effectiveness of performance test suites. Performance mutation testing, which introduces intentional defects (mutants) to measure and enhance fault-detection capabilities, is promising but underexplored. A key challenge is understanding if generated mutants accurately reflect real-world performance issues. Goal: This study evaluates and extends mutation operators for performance testing. Its objectives include (i) collecting existing performance mutation operators, (ii) introducing new operators from real-world code changes that impact performance, and (iii) evaluating these operators on real-world systems to see if they effectively degrade performance. Method: To this aim, we will (i) review the literature to identify performance mutation operators, (ii) conduct a mining study to extract patterns of code changes linked to performance regressions, (iii) propose new mutation operators based on these patterns, and (iv) apply and evaluate the operators to assess their effectiveness in exposing performance degradations. Expected Outcomes: We aim to provide an enriched set of mutation operators for performance testing, helping developers and researchers identify harmful coding practices and design better strategies to detect and prevent performance regressions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 22nd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR) - Registered Reports</p></details> |
| **[Selfdual skew cyclic codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12340v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Given a finite extension $K/F$ of degree $r$ of a finite field $F$, we enumerate all selfdual skew cyclic codes in the Ore quotient ring $K[X;\text{Frob}]/(X^{rk}-1)$ for any positive integer $k$ coprime to the characteristic $p$ (separable case). We also provide an enumeration algorithm when $k$ is a power of $p$ (purely inseparable case), at the cost of some redundancies. Our approach is based on an explicit bijection between skew cyclic codes, on the one hand, and certain families of $F$-linear subspaces of some extensions of $K$. Finally, we report on an implementation in SageMath.</p></details> |  |

We present Genetic-Instruct, a scalable algorithm for synthesizing large-scale, high quality coding instructions using evolutionary principles. Starting from a small set of seed instructions, Genetic-Instruct generates diverse and challenging instruction-code pairs by leveraging an Instructor-LLM for generation, a Coder-LLM for code synthesis, and a Judge-LLM for automatic quality evaluation. Our proposed approach is highly parallelizable and effective even with a small seed data and weaker generator models. We generated more than 7.5 million coding instructions with the proposed approach. Then we evaluated it by fine-tuning LLMs with the synthetic samples and demonstrated a significant improvement in their code generation capability compared to the other synthetic generation approaches and publicly available datasets. Our results highlight the efficiency, scalability, and generalizability of the Genetic-Instruct framework.</p></details> |  |

We present techniques for obtaining in- and out-of-distribution programs with different characteristics: code sampled from a domain-specific language, code automatically generated by an LLM, code collected from competitive programming contests, and mutated versions of these programs. We also present an experimental methodology for evaluating LLM generalization by comparing their performance on these programs. We perform an extensive evaluation across 10 state-of-the-art models from the past year, obtaining insights into their generalization capabilities over time and across different classes of programs. Our results highlight that while earlier models exhibit behavior consistent with pattern matching, the latest models exhibit strong generalization abilities on code reasoning.</p></details> |  |

For code generation, however, their exact mechanics and efficacy are under-explored. We thus investigate the effects of a wide range of prompting strategies with a focus on automatic re-prompting over multiple turns and computational requirements. After systematically decomposing reasoning, instruction, and execution feedback prompts, we conduct an extensive grid search on the competitive programming benchmarks CodeContests and TACO for multiple LLM families and sizes (Llama 3.0 and 3.1, 8B, 70B, 405B, and GPT-4o). Our study reveals strategies that consistently improve performance across all models with small and large sampling budgets. We then show how finetuning with such an optimal configuration allows models to internalize the induced reasoning process and obtain improvements in performance and scalability for multi-turn code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

We provide a novel, theoretical study of non-orthogonal signaling to expand the applicability of these schemes. Motivated by a class of multi-carrier spread spectrum systems, this paper presents a thorough symbol error rate analysis of the broad class of multi-code signaling methods when they make use of codes which are not necessarily orthogonal. Our analysis is also extended to the case where the code set includes the negative of each code vector, i.e., an extension to biorthogonal signaling. Moreover, it is shown that the symbol error rate results derived in this paper reduce to those available in the literature when the multi-codes are orthogonal or have equal correlation between vectors. Additionally, we show how Monte Carlo integration can be used to evaluate the integrals in the error probability calculation and derive low complexity upper bounds on the error probabilities.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

The primary research question is whether lightweight, locally executed LLMs can generate correct Python code for these tasks. To assess this, we compared locally run models against state-of-the-art alternatives, such as GPT-4 and DeepSeek-V3, which served as reference points. By extracting and executing the Python functions generated by each model, we evaluated their outputs on a zero-to-five scale. Results show that while DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4 consistently provided accurate solutions, certain smaller models -- particularly Phi-4 and LLaMA-3.3 -- also demonstrated strong performance, underscoring the viability of lightweight alternatives. Other models exhibited errors stemming from incomplete understanding or syntactic issues. These findings illustrate the potential of LLM-based approaches for specialized engineering applications while highlighting the need for careful model selection, rigorous prompt design, and targeted domain fine-tuning to achieve reliable outcomes.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The peer-reviewed version of this paper is published in Electronics at https://doi.org/10.3390/electronics14071428.

This evidence is crucial, as medical coders have to make sure there exists at least one explicit passage in the input health record that justifies the attribution of a code. We therefore propose to reframe the task as an entity linking problem, in which each document is annotated with its set of codes and respective textual evidence, enabling better human-machine collaboration. By leveraging parameter-efficient fine-tuning of Large Language Models (LLMs), together with constrained decoding, we introduce three approaches to solve this problem that prove effective at disambiguating clinical mentions and that perform well in few-shot scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CL4Health at NAACL 2025</p></details> |

Existing approaches come with a mix of restrictions - they require annotated training data, assume access to template-based shape priors or artist-designed deformation rigs, suffer from limited generalization to unseen motion and/or shapes, or exhibit motion jitter. We propose Self-supervised Motion Fields (SMF) as a self-supervised framework that can be robustly trained with sparse motion representations, without requiring dataset specific annotations, templates, or rigs. At the heart of our method are Kinetic Codes, a novel autoencoder-based sparse motion encoding, that exposes a semantically rich latent space simplifying large-scale training. Our architecture comprises dedicated spatial and temporal gradient predictors, which are trained end-to-end. The resultant network, regularized by the Kinetic Codes's latent space, has good generalization across shapes and motions. We evaluated our method on unseen motion sampled from AMASS, D4D, Mixamo, and raw monocular video for animation transfer on various characters with varying shapes and topology. We report a new SoTA on the AMASS dataset in the context of generalization to unseen motion. Project webpage at https://motionfields.github.io/</p></details> |  |
| **[VeCoGen: Automating Generation of Formally Verified C Code with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19275v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have demonstrated impressive capabilities in generating code, yet they often produce programs with flaws or deviations from intended behavior, limiting their suitability for safety-critical applications. To address this limitation, this paper introduces VECOGEN, a novel tool that combines large language models with formal verification to automate the generation of formally verified C programs. VECOGEN takes a formal specification in ANSI/ISO C Specification Language, a natural language specification, and a set of test cases to attempt to generate a verified program. This program-generation process consists of two steps. First, VECOGEN generates an initial set of candidate programs. Secondly, the tool iteratively improves on previously generated candidates. If a candidate program meets the formal specification, then we are sure the program is correct. We evaluate VECOGEN on 15 problems presented in Codeforces competitions. On these problems, VECOGEN solves 13 problems. This work shows the potential of combining large language models with formal verification to automate program generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feature Coding in the Era of Large Models: Dataset, Test Conditions, and Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.04307v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large models have achieved remarkable performance across various tasks, yet they incur significant computational costs and privacy concerns during both training and inference. Distributed deployment has emerged as a potential solution, but it necessitates the exchange of intermediate information between model segments, with feature representations serving as crucial information carriers. To optimize information exchange, feature coding methods are applied to reduce transmission and storage overhead. Despite its importance, feature coding for large models remains an under-explored area. In this paper, we draw attention to large model feature coding and make three contributions to this field. First, we introduce a comprehensive dataset encompassing diverse features generated by three representative types of large models. Second, we establish unified test conditions, enabling standardized evaluation pipelines and fair comparisons across future feature coding studies. Third, we introduce two baseline methods derived from widely used image coding techniques and benchmark their performance on the proposed dataset. These contributions aim to advance the field of feature coding, facilitating more efficient large model deployment.

| **[Feature Importance-Aware Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Computationally Efficient and Adjustable Image Transmission](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04758v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (deepJSCC) have significantly improved communication performance, but their high computational demands restrict practical deployment. Furthermore, some applications require the adaptive adjustment of computational complexity. To address these challenges, we propose a computationally efficient and adjustable deepJSCC model for image transmission, which we call feature importance-aware deepJSCC (FAJSCC). Unlike existing deepJSCC models that equally process all neural features of images, FAJSCC first classifies features into important and less important features and then processes them differently. Specifically, computationally-intensive self-attention is applied to the important features and computationally-efficient spatial attention to the less important ones. The feature classification is based on the available computational budget and importance scores predicted by an importance predictor, which estimates each feature's contribution to performance. It also allows independent adjustment of encoder and decoder complexity within a single trained model. With these properties, our FAJSCC is the first deepJSCC that is computationally efficient and adjustable while maintaining high performance. Experiments demonstrate that our FAJSCC achieves higher image transmission performance across various channel conditions while using less computational complexity than the recent state-of-the-art models. Adding to this, by separately varying the computational resources of the encoder and decoder, it is concluded that the decoder's error correction function requires the largest computational complexity in FAJSCC, which is the first observation in deepJSCC literature. The FAJSCC code is publicly available at https://github.com/hansung-choi/FAJSCC.</p></details> |  |
| **[GLDPC-PC Codes: Channel Coding Towards 6G Communications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14828v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The sixth generation (6G) wireless communication system will improve the key technical indicators by one to two orders of magnitude, and come with some new features. As a crucial technique to enhance the reliability and efficiency of data transmission, the next-generation channel coding is thus confronted with new challenges in terms of complexity, latency, performance. This article supplies an overview of the potential channel codes for 6G communications. In addition, we explore to develop next-generation channel codes based on lowdensity parity-check (LDPC) and polar frameworks, introducing a concept named generalized LDPC with polar-like component(GLDPC-PC) codes. The codes have exhibited promising error correction performance and manageable complexity, which can be further optimized by specific code design. The opportunities and challenges of GLDPC-PC codes are also discussed.</p></details> |  |

State of the art (SOTA) code repair methods rely on data-driven approaches and often fail to deliver solution for complicated programming questions. To interpret the natural language of unprecedented programming problems, using Large Language Models (LLMs) for code-feedback generation is crucial. LLMs generate more comprehensible feedback than compiler-generated error messages, and Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) further enhances quality by integrating human-in-the-loop which helps novice students to lean programming from scratch interactively. We are applying RLHF fine-tuning technique for an expected Socratic response such as a question with hint to solve the programming issue. We are proposing code feedback generation tool by fine-tuning LLM with RLHF, Automated Code Evaluation with RLHF (ACE-RLHF), combining two open-source LLM models with two different SOTA optimization techniques. The quality of feedback is evaluated on two benchmark datasets containing basic and competition-level programming questions where the later is proposed by us. We achieved 2-5% higher accuracy than RL-free SOTA techniques using Llama-3-7B-Proximal-policy optimization in automated evaluation and similar or slightly higher accuracy compared to reward model-free RL with AI Feedback (RLAIF). We achieved almost 40% higher accuracy with GPT-3.5 Best-of-n optimization while performing manual evaluation.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Studying the Impact of Early Test Termination Due to Assertion Failure on Code Coverage and Spectrum-based Fault Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04557v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An assertion is commonly used to validate the expected programs behavior (e.g., if the returned value of a method equals an expected value) in software testing. Although it is a recommended practice to use only one assertion in a single test to avoid code smells (e.g., Assertion Roulette), it is common to have multiple assertions in a single test. One issue with tests that have multiple assertions is that when the test fails at an early assertion (not the last one), the test will terminate at that point, and the remaining testing code will not be executed. This, in turn, can potentially reduce the code coverage and the performance of techniques that rely on code coverage information (e.g., spectrum-based fault localization). We refer to such a scenario as early test termination. Understanding the impact of early test termination on test coverage is important for software testing and debugging, particularly for the techniques that rely on coverage information obtained from the testing. We conducted the first empirical study on early test termination due to assertion failure (i.e., early test termination) by investigating 207 versions of 6 open-source projects. We found that a nonnegligible portion of the failed tests (19.1%) is early terminated due to assertion failure. Our findings indicate that early test termination harms both code coverage and the effectiveness of spectrum-based fault localization. For instance, after eliminating early test termination, the line/branch coverage is improved in 55% of the studied versions, and improves the performance of two popular SBFL techniques Ochiai and Tarantula by 15.1% and 10.7% compared to the original setting (without eliminating early test termination) in terms of MFR, respectively.</p></details> |  |

This opportunistic behavior hinders the effective generation of programs that trigger bugs in compilers and analyzers, even when such programs closely resemble those generated. To address this limitation, we propose bounded exhaustive random program generation, a novel method that focuses the search space of program generation with the aim of more quickly identifying bug-triggering programs. Our approach comprises two stages: 1) generating random program templates, which are incomplete test programs containing bug-related placeholders, and 2) conducting a bounded exhaustive enumeration of valid values for each placeholder within these templates. To ensure efficiency, we maintain a solvable constraint set during the template generation phase and then methodically explore all possible values of placeholders within these constraints during the exhaustive enumeration phase. We have implemented this approach for Solidity, a popular smart contract language for the Ethereum blockchain, in a tool named Erwin. Based on a recent study of Solidity compiler bugs, the placeholders used by Erwin relate to language features commonly associated with compiler bugs. Erwin has successfully identified 23 previously unknown bugs across two Solidity compilers, solc and solang, and one Solidity static analyzer, slither. Evaluation results demonstrate that Erwin outperforms state-of-the-art Solidity fuzzers in bug detection and complements developer-written test suites by covering 4,582 edges and 14,737 lines of the solc compiler that were missed by solc unit tests.</p></details> |  |

A central challenge lies in fast fitness evaluations on large training datasets, especially for complex real-world problems involving time-consuming simulations. Surrogate models, like phenotypic characterization (PC)-based K-nearest neighbors (KNN), have been applied to reduce computational cost. However, the PC-based similarity measure is confined to behavioral characteristics, overlooking genotypic differences, which can limit surrogate quality and impair performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes a pheno-geno unified surrogate GP algorithm, PGU-SGP, integrating phenotypic and genotypic characterization (GC) to enhance surrogate sample selection and fitness prediction. A novel unified similarity metric combining PC and GC distances is proposed, along with an effective and efficient GC representation. Experimental results of a real-life vehicle scheduling problem demonstrate that PGU-SGP reduces training time by approximately 76% while achieving comparable performance to traditional GP. With the same training time, PGU-SGP significantly outperforms traditional GP and the state-of-the-art algorithm on most datasets. Additionally, PGU-SGP shows faster convergence and improved surrogate quality by maintaining accurate fitness rankings and appropriate selection pressure, further validating its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, 8 tables.

The fitness evaluation in genetic programming suffers from high computational requirements, limiting the performance on difficult problems. Consequently, there is no efficient genetic programming framework that is usable for a wide range of tasks. To this end, we developed Kozax, a genetic programming framework that evolves symbolic expressions for arbitrary problems. We implemented Kozax using JAX, a framework for high-performance and scalable machine learning, which allows the fitness evaluation to scale efficiently to large populations or datasets on GPU. Furthermore, Kozax offers constant optimization, custom operator definition and simultaneous evolution of multiple trees. We demonstrate successful applications of Kozax to discover equations of natural laws, recover equations of hidden dynamic variables, evolve a control policy and optimize an objective function. Overall, Kozax provides a general, fast, and scalable library to optimize white-box solutions in the realm of scientific computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 fig...</summary><p>6 figures, 3 tables, 1 algorithm, 13 pages</p></details> |
| **[Finding Locally Densest Subgraphs: Convex Programming with Edge and Triangle Density](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10937v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finding the densest subgraph (DS) from a graph is a fundamental problem in graph databases. The DS obtained, which reveals closely related entities, has been found to be useful in various application domains such as e-commerce, social science, and biology. However, in a big graph that contains billions of edges, it is desirable to find more than one subgraph cluster that is not necessarily the densest, yet they reveal closely related vertices. In this paper, we study the locally densest subgraph (LDS), a recently proposed variant of DS. An LDS is a subgraph which is the densest among the ``local neighbors''. Given a graph $G$, a number of LDSs can be returned, which reflect different dense regions of $G$ and thus give more information than DS. The existing LDS solution suffers from low efficiency. We thus develop a convex-programming-based solution that enables powerful pruning. We also extend our algorithm to triangle-based density to solve LTDS problem. Based on current algorithms, we propose a unified framework for the LDS and LTDS problems. Extensive experiments on thirteen real large graph datasets show that our proposed algorithm is up to four orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Products of Recursive Programs for Hypersafety Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10800v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of automated hypersafety verification of infinite-state recursive programs. We propose an infinite class of product programs, specifically designed with recursion in mind, that reduce the hypersafety verification of a recursive program to standard safety verification. For this, we combine insights from language theory and concurrency theory to propose an algorithmic solution for constructing an infinite class of recursive product programs. One key insight is that, using the simple theory of visibly pushdown languages, one can maintain the recursive structure of syntactic program alignments which is vital to constructing a new product program that can be viewed as a classic recursive program -- that is, one that can be executed on a single stack. Another key insight is that techniques from concurrency theory can be generalized to help define product programs based on the view that the parallel composition of individual recursive programs includes all possible alignments from which a sound set of alignments that faithfully preserve the satisfaction of the hypersafety property can be selected. On the practical side, we formulate a family of parametric canonical product constructions that are intuitive to programmers and can be used as building blocks to specify recursive product programs for the purpose of relational and hypersafety verification, with the idea that the right product program can be verified automatically using existing techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques through an implementation and highly promising experimental results.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages of main text (7 figures) and 13 pages of appendix</p></details> |
| **[Revocable Encryption, Programs, and More: The Case of Multi-Copy Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.13163v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fundamental principles of quantum mechanics have inspired many new research directions, particularly in quantum cryptography. One such principle is quantum no-cloning which has led to the emerging field of revocable cryptography. Roughly speaking, in a revocable cryptographic primitive, a cryptographic object (such as a ciphertext or program) is represented as a quantum state in such a way that surrendering it effectively translates into losing the capability to use this cryptographic object. All of the revocable cryptographic systems studied so far have a major drawback: the recipient only receives one copy of the quantum state. Worse yet, the schemes become completely insecure if the recipient receives many identical copies of the same quantum state -- a property that is clearly much more desirable in practice. While multi-copy security has been extensively studied for a number of other quantum cryptographic primitives, it has so far received only little treatment in context of unclonable primitives. Our work, for the first time, shows the feasibility of revocable primitives, such as revocable encryption and revocable programs, which satisfy multi-copy security in oracle models. This suggest that the stronger notion of multi-copy security is within reach in unclonable cryptography more generally, and therefore could lead to a new research direction in the field.</p></details> | 42 pages |

This work presents a computational methodology for searching for pathways in reaction networks which is based on integer linear programming and the modeling of reaction networks by directed hypergraphs. Often multiple pathways fit the given search criteria. To rank them, we develop an objective function based on physical arguments maximizing the probability of the pathway. We furthermore develop an automated pipeline to estimate the energy barriers of individual reactions in reaction networks. Combined, the methodology facilitates flexible and kinetically informed pathway investigations on large reaction networks by computational means, even for networks coming without kinetic annotation, such as those created via generative approaches for expanding molecular spaces.</p></details> |  |

Latency, bandwidth constraints, and the heterogeneity of edge environments hinder the efficiency of centralized cloud solutions. While major cloud providers extend their platforms to the edge, these approaches often overlook its unique characteristics, limiting its potential. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Radon, a flexible programming model and platform designed for the edge-to-cloud continuum. Radon applications are structured as atoms, isolated stateful entities that communicate through messaging and can be composed into complex systems. The Radon runtime, based on WebAssembly (WASM), enables language- and deployment-independent execution, ensuring portability and adaptability across heterogeneous environments. This decoupling allows developers to focus on application logic while the runtime optimizes for diverse infrastructure conditions. We present a prototype implementation of Radon and evaluate its effectiveness through a distributed key-value store case study. We analyze the implementation in terms of code complexity and performance. Our results demonstrate that Radon facilitates the development and operation of scalable applications across the edge-to-cloud continuum advancing the current state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to EDCCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Rel: A Programming Language for Relational Data](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10323v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>From the moment of their inception, languages for relational data have been described as sublanguages embedded in a host programming language. Rel is a new relational language whose key design goal is to go beyond this paradigm with features that allow for programming in the large, making it possible to fully describe end to end application semantics. With the new approach we can model the semantics of entire enterprise applications relationally, which helps significantly reduce architecture complexity and avoid the well-known impedance mismatch problem. This paradigm shift is enabled by 50 years of database research, making it possible to revisit the sublanguage/host language paradigm, starting from the fundamental principles. We present the main features of Rel: those that give it the power to express traditional query language operations and those that are designed to grow the language and allow programming in the large.</p></details> |  |

Being essentially a program synthesis algorithm, it is capable of tackling multiple problem domains. Current benchmarking initiatives are fragmented, as the different representations are not compared with each other and their performance is not measured across the different domains.

However, most existing code generation models mainly focus on a single or a few programming languages, resulting in unsatisfactory performance in a multilingual environment. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning can significantly improve the performance of the model without the need for retraining or fine-tuning the code generation model by reasonably decomposing complex code generation tasks into multiple subtasks and gradually deriving solutions for each subtask. Nevertheless, the existing CoT generation methods mainly concentrate on Python code, and the performance on other programming languages remains unclear. To fill this gap, we first constructed a CoT generation dataset for 12 programming languages through multi-agent technology. On this basis, we proposed a CoT generation method MSCoT applicable to multiple programming languages. By introducing CoT into the code generation large model, the performance of the code generation large model in a multilingual environment can be improved. Through large-scale empirical research, we compared the generalization abilities of MSCoT and the existing CoT generation methods on multiple programming languages and proved the effectiveness of MSCoT for multiple programming languages. In addition, we also designed a human study to prove the quality of the CoT generated by MSCoT. Finally, we opensourced the model and dataset of MSCoT to promote the research on CoT generation for multiple programming languages.</p></details> | Accepted |

During the program optimisation process, it would be desirable to have a tool which can automatically verify whether an optimised subprogram can replace the original subprogram. Formally this corresponds to the problem of verifying the strong equivalence of two programs. In order to do so, the translation tool anthem was developed. It can be used in conjunction with an automated theorem prover for classical logic to verify that two programs are strongly equivalent. With the current version of anthem, only the strong equivalence of positive programs with a restricted input language can be verified. This is a result of the translation $\tau^*$ implemented in anthem that produces formulas in the logic of here-and-there, which coincides with classical logic only for positive programs. This thesis extends anthem in order to overcome these limitations. First, the transformation $\sigma^*$ is presented, which transforms formulas from the logic of here-and-there to classical logic. A theorem formalises how $\sigma^*$ can be used to express equivalence in the logic of here-and-there in classical logic. Second, the translation $\tau^*$ is extended to programs containing pools. Another theorem shows how $\sigma^*$ can be combined with $\tau^*$ to express the strong equivalence of two programs in classical logic. With $\sigma^*$ and the extended $\tau^*$, it is possible to express the strong equivalence of logic programs containing negation, simple choices, and pools. Both the extended $\tau^*$ and $\sigma^*$ are implemented in a new version of anthem. Several examples of logic programs containing pools, negation, and simple choice rules, which the new version of anthem can translate to classical logic, are presented.

| **[Context Switching for Secure Multi-programming of Near-Term Quantum Computers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07048v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-programming quantum computers improve device utilization and throughput. However, crosstalk from concurrent two-qubit CNOT gates poses security risks, compromising the fidelity and output of co-running victim programs. We design Zero Knowledge Tampering Attacks (ZKTAs), using which attackers can exploit crosstalk without knowledge of the hardware error profile. ZKTAs can alter victim program outputs in 40% of cases on commercial systems. We identify that ZKTAs succeed because the attacker's program consistently runs with the same victim program in a fixed context. To mitigate this, we propose QONTEXTS: a context-switching technique that defends against ZKTAs by running programs across multiple contexts, each handling only a subset of trials. QONTEXTS uses multi-programming with frequent context switching while identifying a unique set of programs for each context. This helps limit only a fraction of execution to ZKTAs. We enhance QONTEXTS with attack detection capabilities that compare the distributions from different contexts against each other to identify noisy contexts executed with ZKTAs. Our evaluations on real IBMQ systems show that QONTEXTS increases program resilience by three orders of magnitude and fidelity by 1.33$\times$ on average. Moreover, QONTEXTS improves throughput by 2$\times$, advancing security in multi-programmed environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Executable Functional Abstractions: Inferring Generative Programs for Advanced Math Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09763v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scientists often infer abstract procedures from specific instances of problems and use the abstractions to generate new, related instances. For example, programs encoding the formal rules and properties of a system have been useful in fields ranging from RL (procedural environments) to physics (simulation engines). These programs can be seen as functions which execute to different outputs based on their parameterizations (e.g., gridworld configuration or initial physical conditions). We introduce the term EFA (Executable Functional Abstraction) to denote such programs for math problems. EFA-like constructs have been shown to be useful for math reasoning as problem generators for stress-testing models. However, prior work has been limited to abstractions for grade-school math (whose simple rules are easy to encode in programs), while generating EFAs for advanced math has thus far required human engineering. We explore the automatic construction of EFAs for advanced math problems. We operationalize the task of automatically constructing EFAs as a program synthesis task, and develop EFAGen, which conditions an LLM on a seed math problem and its step-by-step solution to generate candidate EFA programs that are faithful to the generalized problem and solution class underlying the seed problem. Furthermore, we formalize properties any valid EFA must possess in terms of executable unit tests, and show how the tests can be used as verifiable rewards to train LLMs to become better writers of EFAs. We demonstrate that EFAs constructed by EFAGen behave rationally by remaining faithful to seed problems, produce learnable problem variations, and that EFAGen can infer EFAs across multiple diverse sources of competition-level math problems. Finally, we show downstream uses of model-written EFAs e.g. finding problem variations that are harder or easier for a learner to solve, as well as data generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zaidkhan.me/EFAGen/</p></details> |

However, these problems are often autograded on the correctness of the final submission through test cases, and students cannot get feedback on their planning process. Large language models (LLM) may be able to generate this feedback by detecting the overall code structure even for submissions with syntax errors. To this end, we propose an approach that detects which high-level goals and patterns (i.e. programming plans) exist in a student program with LLMs. We show that both the full GPT-4o model and a small variant (GPT-4o-mini) can detect these plans with remarkable accuracy, outperforming baselines inspired by conventional approaches to code analysis. We further show that the smaller, cost-effective variant (GPT-4o-mini) achieves results on par with state-of-the-art (GPT-4o) after fine-tuning, creating promising implications for smaller models for real-time grading. These smaller models can be incorporated into autograders for open-ended code-writing exercises to provide feedback for students' implicit planning skills, even when their program is syntactically incorrect. Furthermore, LLMs may be useful in providing feedback for problems in other domains where students start with a set of high-level solution steps and iteratively compute the output, such as math and physics problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as full paper at AIED 2025</p></details> |
| **[Is Productivity in Quantum Programming Equivalent to Expressiveness?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08876v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The expressiveness of quantum programming languages plays a crucial role in the efficient and comprehensible representation of quantum algorithms. Unlike classical programming languages, which offer mature and well-defined abstraction mechanisms, quantum languages must integrate cognitively challenging concepts such as superposition, interference and entanglement while maintaining clarity and usability. However, identifying and characterizing differences in expressiveness between quantum programming paradigms remains an open area of study. Our work investigates the landscape of expressiveness through a comparative analysis of hosted quantum programming languages such as Qiskit, Cirq, Qrisp, and quAPL, and standalone languages including Q# and Qmod. We focused on evaluating how different quantum programming languages support the implementation of core quantum algorithms -- Deutsch-Jozsa, Simon, Bernstein-Vazirani, and Grover -- using expressiveness metrics: Lines of Code (LOC), Cyclomatic Complexity (CC), and Halstead Complexity (HC) metrics as proxies for developer productivity. Our findings suggest that different quantum programming paradigms offer distinct trade-offs between expressiveness and productivity, highlighting the importance of language design in quantum software development.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

Automated quantum circuit synthesis via quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising solution, employing trainable parametric quantum circuits to alleviate this. The circuit ansatz in these solutions is often designed through reinforcement learning-based quantum architecture search when the domain knowledge of the problem and hardware are not effective. However, the interpretability of these synthesized circuits remains a significant bottleneck, limiting their scalability and applicability across diverse problem domains. This work addresses the challenge of explainability in quantum architecture search (QAS) by introducing a novel genetic programming-based decompiler framework for reverse-engineering high-level quantum algorithms from low-level circuit representations. The proposed approach, implemented in the open-source tool DeQompile, employs program synthesis techniques, including symbolic regression and abstract syntax tree manipulation, to distill interpretable Qiskit algorithms from quantum assembly language. Validation of benchmark algorithms demonstrates the efficacy of our tool. By integrating the decompiler with online learning frameworks, this research potentiates explainable QAS by fostering the development of generalizable and provable quantum algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Inequality constraints are handled using a primal-dual interior point formulation and step acceptance for equality constraints follows a line-search filter approach. The iterates of the algorithm are derived under the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) framework. Our numerical experiments evaluate IPDDP2 on four robotic motion planning problems. IPDDP2 reliably converges to low optimality error and exhibits local quadratic and global convergence from remote starting points. Notably, we showcase the robustness of IPDDP2 by using it to solve a contact-implicit, joint limited acrobot swing-up problem involving complementarity constraints from a range of initial conditions. We provide a full implementation of IPDDP2 in the Julia programming language.</p></details> |  |

These archetypes encapsulate the topological relationships between data entities and the execution flow in a structured manner, enabling more expressive and semantically rich computations over interconnected data structures or finite states. By formalizing the relationships between data elements in this topological space, our approach allows for more intuitive modeling of complex systems where a topology of connections is formed for the underlying computational model. This paradigm addresses limitations in traditional OOP when representing a wide range of problems in computer science such as agent-based systems, social networks, processing on relational data, neural networks, distributed systems, finite state machines, and other spatially-oriented computational problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 41 pages with appendix</p></details> |

A single and simple definition is possible, removing this split. A loop is just the limit (a variant of the reflexive transitive closure) of a Noetherian (well-founded) relation. To prove the loop correct there is no need to devise an invariant and a variant; it suffices to identify the relation, yielding both partial correctness and termination. The present note develops the (small) theory and applies it to standard loop examples and proofs of their correctness.</p></details> |  |

To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce L0-Bench, a language model benchmark for testing procedural correctness -- the ability to generate correct reasoning processes, complementing existing benchmarks that primarily focus on outcome correctness. Given synthetic Python functions with simple operations, L0-Bench grades models on their ability to generate step-by-step, error-free execution traces. The synthetic nature of L0-Bench enables systematic and scalable generation of test programs along various axes (e.g., number of trace steps). We evaluate a diverse array of recent closed-source and open-weight models on a baseline test set. All models exhibit degradation as the number of target trace steps increases, while larger models and reasoning-enhanced models better maintain correctness over multiple steps. Additionally, we use L0-Bench to explore test-time scaling along three dimensions: input context length, number of solutions for majority voting, and inference steps. Our results suggest substantial room to improve "level-0" reasoning and potential directions to build more reliable reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces an innovative approach that combines Genetic Programming (GP) with a Transformer trained through Reinforcement Learning (GPRT), specifically designed to tackle the complexities of dynamic scheduling scenarios. GPRT leverages the Transformer to refine heuristics generated by GP while also seeding and guiding the evolution of GP. This dual functionality enhances the adaptability and effectiveness of the scheduling heuristics, enabling them to better respond to the dynamic nature of real-world tasks. The efficacy of this integrated approach is demonstrated through a practical application in container terminal truck scheduling, where the GPRT method outperforms traditional GP, standalone Transformer methods, and other state-of-the-art competitors. The key contribution of this research is the development of the GPRT method, which showcases a novel combination of GP and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to produce robust and efficient scheduling solutions. Importantly, GPRT is not limited to container port truck scheduling; it offers a versatile framework applicable to various dynamic scheduling challenges. Its practicality, coupled with its interpretability and ease of modification, makes it a valuable tool for diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

A unique adaptive intervention design paradigm is presented in this work, where causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are for effectively recovered with practical budgetary considerations. In order to choose treatments that optimize information gain under these considerations, an iterative integer programming (IP) approach is proposed, which drastically reduces the number of experiments required. Simulations over a broad range of graph sizes and edge densities are used to assess the effectiveness of the suggested approach. Results show that the proposed adaptive IP approach achieves full causal graph recovery with fewer intervention iterations and variable manipulations than random intervention baselines, and it is also flexible enough to accommodate a variety of practical constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Formal Verification of Quantum Error Correcting Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07732v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum error correction (QEC) is fundamental for suppressing noise in quantum hardware and enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation. In this paper, we propose an efficient verification framework for QEC programs. We define an assertion logic and a program logic specifically crafted for QEC programs and establish a sound proof system. We then develop an efficient method for handling verification conditions (VCs) of QEC programs: for Pauli errors, the VCs are reduced to classical assertions that can be solved by SMT solvers, and for non-Pauli errors, we provide a heuristic algorithm. We formalize the proposed program logic in Coq proof assistant, making it a verified QEC verifier. Additionally, we implement an automated QEC verifier, Veri-QEC, for verifying various fault-tolerant scenarios. We demonstrate the efficiency and broad functionality of the framework by performing different verification tasks across various scenarios. Finally, we present a benchmark of 14 verified stabilizer codes.</p></details> | 41 pages, 10 figures |

Recent work has introduced the possibility to certify the computational complexity of branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithms when solving MILP and MIQP problems formulated as multi-parametric MILPs (mp-MILPs) and mp-MIQPs. Such a framework allows for computing the worst-case computational complexity of standard B&B-based MILP and MIQP solvers, quantified by metrics such as the total number of LP/QP iterations and B&B nodes. These results are highly relevant for real-time hybrid MPC applications. In this paper, we extend this framework by developing parallel, domain-decomposition versions of the previously proposed algorithm, allowing it to scale to larger problem sizes and enable the use of high-performance computing (HPC) resources. Furthermore, to reduce peak memory consumption, we introduce two novel modifications to the existing (serial) complexity certification framework, integrating them into the proposed parallel algorithms. Numerical experiments show that the parallel algorithms significantly reduce computation time while maintaining the correctness of the original framework.</p></details> |  |

These optimization problems often take the form of mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) or mixed-integer quadratic programs (MIQPs) that depend on system parameters. A common approach for solving such problems is the branch-and-bound (B&B) method. This paper extends existing complexity certification methods by presenting a unified complexity-certification framework for B&B-based MILP and MIQP solvers, specifically for the family of multi-parametric MILP and MIQP problems that arise in, e.g., hybrid MPC applications. The framework provides guarantees on worst-case computational measures, including the maximum number of iterations or relaxations B&B algorithms require to reach optimality. It systematically accounts for different branching and node selection strategies, as well as heuristics integrated into B&B, ensuring a comprehensive certification framework. By offering theoretical guarantees and practical insights for solver customization, the proposed framework enhances the reliability of B&B for real-time application. The usefulness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through numerical experiments on both random MILPs and MIQPs, as well as on MIQPs arising from a hybrid MPC problem.</p></details> |  |

We investigate its capabilities in providing high-quality programming tasks to students. Despite promising advancements in task generation, a quality gap remains between AI-generated and expert-created tasks. The AI-generated tasks may not align with target programming concepts, could be incomprehensible for students to solve, or may contain critical issues such as incorrect tests. Existing works often require interventions from human teachers for validation. We address these challenges by introducing PyTaskSyn, a novel synthesis technique that first generates a programming task and then decides whether it meets certain quality criteria to be given to students. The key idea is to break this process into multiple stages performed by expert and student agents simulated using both strong and weaker generative models. Through extensive evaluation, we show that PyTaskSyn significantly improves task quality compared to baseline techniques and showcases the importance of each specialized agent type in our validation pipeline. Additionally, we conducted user studies using our publicly available web application and show that PyTaskSyn can deliver high-quality programming tasks comparable to expert-designed ones while reducing workload and costs, and being more engaging than programming tasks that are available in online resources.</p></details> | AIED'25 paper |

However, frequent solver invocations are still the main performance bottleneck of these techniques. One way to mitigate this challenge is through optimizations such as caching and reusing solver results. While current methods typically focus on reusing results from fully equivalent or closely related formulas, they often miss broader opportunities for reuse. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Cache-a-lot, that extends the reuse of unsatisfiable (unsat) results by systematically considering all possible variable substitutions. This enables more extensive reuse of results, thereby reducing the number of SMT solver invocations and improving the overall efficiency of concolic and symbolic execution. Our evaluation, conducted against the state-of-the-art Utopia solution using two benchmark sets, shows significant improvements, particularly with more complex formulas. Our method achieves up to 74% unsat core reuse, compared to Utopia's 41%, and significant increase in the time savings. These results demonstrate that, despite the additional computational complexity, the broader reuse of unsat results significantly enhances performance, offering valuable advancements for formal verification and program analysis.</p></details> |  |

We explore two key frameworks that provide both logical and computational foundations for quantum programming languages. The first framework, the Lambda-$S$ calculus, extends the lambda calculus by incorporating quantum superposition, enforcing linearity, and ensuring unitarity, to model quantum control. Its categorical semantics establishes a structured connection between classical and quantum computation through an adjunction between Cartesian closed categiries and additive symmetric monoidal closed categories. The second framework, the $\mathcal L^{\mathbb C}$ calculus, introduces a proof language for intuitionistic linear logic augmented with sum and scalar operations. This enables the formal encoding of quantum superpositions and measurements, leading to a computational model grounded in categorical structures with biproducts. These approaches suggest a fundamental duality between quantum computation and linear logic, highlighting structural correspondences between logical proofs and quantum programs. We discuss ongoing developments, including extensions to polymorphism, categorical and realizability models, as well as the integration of the modality !, which further solidify the connection between logic and quantum programming languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>Invit...</summary><p>Invited talk at the Quantum Computing session at CiE 2025</p></details> |

A key difficulty in cross-language translation is that one has to re-express the intended behavior of the source program into idiomatic constructs of a different target language. This task needs abstracting away from the source language-specific details, while keeping the overall functionality the same. In this work, we propose a novel and systematic approach for making such translation amenable to automation based on a framework we call program skeletons. A program skeleton retains the high-level structure of the source program by abstracting away and effectively summarizing lower-level concrete code fragments, which can be mechanically translated to the target programming language. A skeleton, by design, permits many different ways of filling in the concrete implementation for fragments, which can work in conjunction with existing data-driven code synthesizers. Most importantly, skeletons can conceptually enable sound decomposition, i.e., if each individual fragment is correctly translated, taken together with the mechanically translated skeleton, the final translated program is deemed to be correct as a whole. We present a prototype system called Skel embodying the idea of skeleton-based translation from Python to JavaScript. Our results show promising scalability compared to prior works. For 9 real-world Python programs, some with more than about 1k lines of code, 95% of their code fragments can be automatically translated, while about 5% require manual effort. All the final translations are correct with respect to whole-program test suites.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by PLDI 2025 (46th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation)</p></details> |

We propose the use of foundation model programs, i.e., programs that can invoke foundation models with varying resource costs and performance, as an approach to this problem. Specifically, we present a method that translates a task into a program, then learns a policy for resource allocation that, on each input, selects foundation model "backends" for each program module. The policy uses smaller, cheaper backends to handle simpler subtasks, while allowing more complex subtasks to leverage larger, more capable models. We evaluate the method on two new "streaming" visual question-answering tasks in which a system answers a question on a sequence of inputs, receiving ground-truth feedback after each answer. Compared to monolithic multi-modal models, our implementation achieves up to 98% resource savings with minimal accuracy loss, demonstrating its potential for scalable and resource-efficient multi-modal inference.</p></details> |  |

However, the search process is often inefficient, taking hours or even days to discover optimal programs due to the exploration mechanisms guided by an accurate but slow-learned cost model. Meanwhile, the learned cost model trained on one platform cannot seamlessly adapt online to another, which we call cross-platform online unawareness. In this work, we propose Pruner and MoA-Pruner. Pruner is a "Draft-then-Verify" exploration mechanism that accelerates the schedule search process. Instead of applying the complex learned cost model to all explored candidates, Pruner drafts small-scale potential candidates by introducing a naive Symbol-based Analyzer (draft model), then identifies the best candidates by the learned cost model. MoA-Pruner introduces a Momentum online Adaptation strategy to address the cross-platform online unawareness. We incorporate Pruner into the TVM and conduct extensive experiments on three GPU-based platforms. Results show considerable speedup in schedule search time. In online tuning scenarios, Pruner and MoA-Pruner achieve an average speedup of $2.6 \times$ and $4.82 \times$ compared to Ansor. In offline tuning scenarios, Pruner achieves an average speedup of $4.75 \times$ and $4.05\times$ compared to TenSet and TLP, respectively. Furthermore, Pruner achieves an average speedup of $4.08 \times$ compared to MetaSchedule on TensorCore.</p></details> |  |

However, existing uni-modal sewing pattern generation models struggle to effectively encode complex design concepts with a multi-modal nature and correlate them with vectorized sewing patterns that possess precise geometric structures and intricate sewing relations. In this work, we propose a novel sewing pattern generation approach \textbf{Design2GarmentCode} based on Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), to generate parametric pattern-making programs from multi-modal design concepts. LMM offers an intuitive interface for interpreting diverse design inputs, while pattern-making programs could serve as well-structured and semantically meaningful representations of sewing patterns, and act as a robust bridge connecting the cross-domain pattern-making knowledge embedded in LMMs with vectorized sewing patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can flexibly handle various complex design expressions such as images, textual descriptions, designer sketches, or their combinations, and convert them into size-precise sewing patterns with correct stitches. Compared to previous methods, our approach significantly enhances training efficiency, generation quality, and authoring flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>The I...</summary><p>The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Genetic Programming for Explainable Manifold Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14139v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manifold learning techniques play a pivotal role in machine learning by revealing lower-dimensional embeddings within high-dimensional data, thus enhancing both the efficiency and interpretability of data analysis by transforming the data into a lower-dimensional representation. However, a notable challenge with current manifold learning methods is their lack of explicit functional mappings, crucial for explainability in many real-world applications. Genetic programming, known for its interpretable functional tree-based models, has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge. Previous research leveraged multi-objective GP to balance manifold quality against embedding dimensionality, producing functional mappings across a range of embedding sizes. Yet, these mapping trees often became complex, hindering explainability. In response, in this paper, we introduce Genetic Programming for Explainable Manifold Learning (GP-EMaL), a novel approach that directly penalises tree complexity. Our new method is able to maintain high manifold quality while significantly enhancing explainability and also allows customisation of complexity measures, such as symmetry balancing, scaling, and node complexity, catering to diverse application needs. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that GP-EMaL is able to match the performance of the existing approach in most cases, while using simpler, smaller, and more interpretable tree structures. This advancement marks a significant step towards achieving interpretable manifold learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-r...</summary><p>Pre-review pre-print of paper accepted by IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence</p></details> |
| **[Improving Genetic Programming for Symbolic Regression with Equality Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17848v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The search for symbolic regression models with genetic programming (GP) has a tendency of revisiting expressions in their original or equivalent forms. Repeatedly evaluating equivalent expressions is inefficient, as it does not immediately lead to better solutions. However, evolutionary algorithms require diversity and should allow the accumulation of inactive building blocks that can play an important role at a later point. The equality graph is a data structure capable of compactly storing expressions and their equivalent forms allowing an efficient verification of whether an expression has been visited in any of their stored equivalent forms. We exploit the e-graph to adapt the subtree operators to reduce the chances of revisiting expressions. Our adaptation, called eggp, stores every visited expression in the e-graph, allowing us to filter out from the available selection of subtrees all the combinations that would create already visited expressions. Results show that, for small expressions, this approach improves the performance of a simple GP algorithm to compete with PySR and Operon without increasing computational cost. As a highlight, eggp was capable of reliably delivering short and at the same time accurate models for a selected set of benchmarks from SRBench and a set of real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables.

| **[Mixed-Precision Quantization for Deep Vision Models with Integer Quadratic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.05657v2)** | 2025-04-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantization is a widely used technique to compress neural networks. Assigning uniform bit-widths across all layers can result in significant accuracy degradation at low precision and inefficiency at high precision. Mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) addresses this by assigning varied bit-widths to layers, optimizing the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Existing sensitivity-based methods for MPQ assume that quantization errors across layers are independent, which leads to suboptimal choices. We introduce CLADO, a practical sensitivity-based MPQ algorithm that captures cross-layer dependency of quantization error. CLADO approximates pairwise cross-layer errors using linear equations on a small data subset. Layerwise bit-widths are assigned by optimizing a new MPQ formulation based on cross-layer quantization errors using an Integer Quadratic Program. Experiments with CNN and vision transformer models on ImageNet demonstrate that CLADO achieves state-of-the-art mixed-precision quantization performance.

While traditional methods like technical analysis have long served as foundational tools for traders to recognize and act upon market patterns, the evolving landscape has called for more advanced techniques. We explore the use of Vectorial Genetic Programming (VGP) for this task, introducing two new variants of VGP, one that allows operations with complex numbers and another that implements a strongly-typed version of VGP. We evaluate the different variants on three financial instruments, with datasets spanning more than seven years. Despite the inherent difficulty of this task, it was possible to evolve profitable trading strategies. A comparative analysis of the three VGP variants and standard GP revealed that standard GP is always among the worst whereas strongly-typed VGP is always among the best.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Structural temporal logic for mechanized program verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14906v6)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mechanized verification of liveness properties for infinite programs with effects and nondeterminism is challenging. Existing temporal reasoning frameworks operate at the level of models such as traces and automata. Reasoning happens at a very low-level, requiring complex nested (co-)inductive proof techniques and familiarity with proof assistant mechanics (e.g., the guardedness checker). Further, reasoning at the level of models instead of program constructs creates a verification gap that loses the benefits of modularity and composition enjoyed by structural program logics such as Hoare Logic. To address this verification gap, and the lack of compositional proof techniques for temporal specifications, we propose Ticl, a new structural temporal logic. Using ticl, we encode complex (co-)inductive proof techniques as structural lemmas and focus our reasoning on variants and invariants. We show that it is possible to perform compositional proofs of general temporal properties in a proof assistant, while working at a high level of abstraction. We demonstrate the benefits of Ticl by giving mechanized proofs of safety and liveness properties for programs with scheduling, concurrent shared memory, and distributed consensus, demonstrating a low proof-to-code ratio.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Constraint Programming Model For Serial Batch Scheduling With Minimum Batch Size](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08793v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In serial batch (s-batch) scheduling, jobs are grouped in batches and processed sequentially within their batch. This paper considers multiple parallel machines, nonidentical job weights and release times, and sequence-dependent setup times between batches of different families. Although s-batch has been widely studied in the literature, very few papers have taken into account a minimum batch size, typical in practical settings such as semiconductor manufacturing and the metal industry. The problem with this minimum batch size requirement has been mostly tackled with dynamic programming and meta-heuristics, and no article has ever used constraint programming (CP) to do so. This paper fills this gap by proposing, for the first time, a CP model for s-batching with minimum batch size. The computational experiments on standard cases compare the CP model with two existing mixed-integer programming (MIP) models from the literature. The results demonstrate the versatility of the proposed CP model to handle multiple variations of s-batching; and its ability to produce, in large instances, better solutions than the MIP models faster.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Quantum Program Linting with LLMs: Emerging Results from a Comparative Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05204v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the quality of quantum programs is increasingly important; however, traditional static analysis techniques are insufficient due to the unique characteristics of quantum computing. Quantum-specific linting tools, such as LintQ, have been developed to detect quantum-specific programming problems; however, they typically rely on manually crafted analysis queries. The manual effort required to update these tools limits their adaptability to evolving quantum programming practices. To address this challenge, this study investigates the feasibility of employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop a novel linting technique for quantum software development and explores potential avenues to advance linting approaches. We introduce LintQ-LLM, an LLM-based linting tool designed to detect quantum-specific problems comparable to those identified by LintQ. Through an empirical comparative study using real-world Qiskit programs, our results show that LintQ-LLM is a viable solution that complements LintQ, with particular strengths in problem localization, explanation clarity, and adaptability potential for emerging quantum programming frameworks, thus providing a basis for further research. Furthermore, this study discusses several research opportunities for developing more advanced, adaptable, and feedback-aware quantum software quality assurance methods by leveraging LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Normal Nested Answer Set Programs: Syntactics, Semantics and Logical Calculi](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06407v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nested answer set programming (NASP; Lifschitz et al., 1999) generalizes answer set programming (ASP) by admitting nested expressions in rule bodies and heads, and thus, NASP aims at exploiting program succinctness. Yet, although NASP expressiveness is undoubtedly superior to ASP one, the former's reasoning capabilities remain unexplored. This reality seems subsequent to the next existing wide-ranging gap: normal nested programs (NNPs) are not known, or in other words, the nested normal-disjunctive boundary is unidentified thus far. Such an unfavorable situation is yet antagonistic to that of ASP as its normal programs (NPs) have been vital for propelling ASP. We will fill such a gap by defining the NNPs, their semantics and their associated nested logical calculi. Besides, while the unique known way to compute nested programs is unfold them back, we propose to do so in their original form. Firstly, we give the syntax of NNPs. For that, we initially define the positive-Horn nested-expressions and then an NNP rule as one whose head (resp. body) is a positive-Horn (resp. general) nested-expression. Secondly, we set up the semantics of NNPs by lifting to the nesting level, classical NP notions including: answer set, minimal and least model, closedness, supported-ness, immediate consequence operator and program consistency. We besides show that NNP restricted to ASP coincides with NP. Thirdly, we introduce nested logical calculi, concretely, nested unit-resolution and nested hyper unit-resolution, proving that they recover unit-resolution and hyper unit-resolution in the ASP setting. We also show how both nested logical calculi allow to process the least model of not-free NNP programs. To end, we demonstrate that computing answer sets of (resp. not-free) NNP programs is (resp. P-complete) NP-complete.</p></details> |  |

However, many of these tools operate independently from institutional Learning Management Systems, which creates a significant disconnect. This isolation limits the ability to leverage learning materials and exercise context for generating tailored, context-aware feedback. Furthermore, previous research on self-regulated learning and LLM support mainly focused on knowledge acquisition, not the development of important self-regulation skills. To address these challenges, we developed CodeRunner Agent, an LLM-based programming assistant that integrates the CodeRunner, a student-submitted code executing and automated grading plugin in Moodle. CodeRunner Agent empowers educators to customize AI-generated feedback by incorporating detailed context from lecture materials, programming questions, student answers, and execution results. Additionally, it enhances students' self-regulated learning by providing strategy-based AI responses. This integrated, context-aware, and skill-focused approach offers promising avenues for data-driven improvements in programming education.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parallel Batch Scheduling With Incompatible Job Families Via Constraint Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11981v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the incompatible case of parallel batch scheduling, where compatible jobs belong to the same family, and jobs from different families cannot be processed together in the same batch. The state-of-the-art constraint programming (CP) model for this problem relies on specific functions and global constraints only available in a well established commercial CP solver. This paper expands the literature around this problem by proposing four new CP models that can be implemented in commercial and open-source solvers: a new model that relies on automaton constraints, and three alternative models that integrate assignment and scheduling decisions with different strategies and global constraints. Extensive computational experiments on standard test cases under multiple objectives and multiple solvers demonstrate the implementation flexibility and competitive performance of the proposed models.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[High Probability Complexity Bounds of Trust-Region Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming with Heavy-Tailed Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19091v2)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider nonlinear optimization problems with a stochastic objective and deterministic equality constraints. We propose a Trust-Region Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming (TR-SSQP) method and establish its high-probability iteration complexity bounds for identifying first- and second-order $\epsilon$-stationary points. In our algorithm, we assume that exact objective values, gradients, and Hessians are not directly accessible but can be estimated via zeroth-, first-, and second-order probabilistic oracles. Compared to existing complexity studies of SSQP methods that rely on a zeroth-order oracle with sub-exponential tail noise (i.e., light-tailed) and focus mostly on first-order stationarity, our analysis accommodates irreducible and heavy-tailed noise in the zeroth-order oracle and significantly extends the analysis to second-order stationarity. We show that under heavy-tailed noise conditions, our SSQP method achieves the same high-probability first-order iteration complexity bounds as in the light-tailed noise setting, while further exhibiting promising second-order iteration complexity bounds. Specifically, the method identifies a first-order $\epsilon$-stationary point in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations and a second-order $\epsilon$-stationary point in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ iterations with high probability, provided that $\epsilon$ is lower bounded by a constant determined by the irreducible noise level in estimation. We validate our theoretical findings and evaluate the practical performance of our method on CUTEst benchmark test set.</p></details> | 50 pages, 5 figures |

We formulate a comprehensive MIQP model aimed at optimizing the coordination of traffic light systems and CAVs, thereby fully capitalizing on the advantages of CAV integration under conditions of high penetration rates. To effectively approximate the intricate multi-agent MIQP challenges, we develop a distributed algorithm that employs proximal ADMM for solving the convex relaxation of the MIQP while systematically tightening the constraint coefficients to uphold integrality requirements. The performance of our control framework and the efficacy of the distributed algorithm are rigorously validated through a series of simulations conducted across varying penetration rates and traffic volumes.</p></details> | 13 pages |

However, these courses face unique challenges due to the complexity of mobile development environments and the graphical, interactive nature of mobile applications. This paper explores the potential of using GitHub Classroom, combined with the Flutter framework, for the automated assessment of mobile programming assignments. By leveraging GitHub Actions for continuous integration and Flutter's robust support for test automation, the proposed approach enables an auto-grading cost-effective solution. We evaluate the feasibility of integrating these tools through an experiment in a Mobile Programming course and present findings from a student survey that assesses their perceptions of the proposed evaluation model. The results are encouraging, showing that the approach is well-received by students.</p></details> |  |

Giving lower bounds of the least fixed point is crucial for quantitative verification. We propose a new method for obtaining lower bounds of the least fixed point. Drawing inspiration from the verification of non-probabilistic programs, we explore the relationship between the uniqueness of fixed points and program termination, and then develop a framework for lower-bound verification. We introduce a generalisation of ranking supermartingales, which serves as witnesses to the uniqueness of fixed points. Our method can be applied to a wide range of quantitative properties, including the weakest preexpectation, expected runtime, and higher moments of runtime. We provide a template-based algorithm for the automated verification of lower bounds. Our implementation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method via an experiment.</p></details> |  |

The methodology is actualized in Copilot for Xcode, an AI-assisted programming tool crafted for Xcode that employs the RAG module to address software constraints and enables diverse generative programming tasks, including automatic code completion, documentation, error detection, and intelligent user-agent interaction. The results from objective experiments on generated code quality and subjective experiments on user adoption collectively demonstrate the pilot success of the proposed system and mark its significant contributions to the realm of AI-assisted programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is accepted to IEEE CAI2025</p></details> |

Unlike atomic labels or token sequences, programs are naturally represented as abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Such structured representation raises novel issues related to the design and selection of in-context examples (ICEs) presented to the LLM. We focus on decomposing the pool of available ICE trees into fragments, some of which may be better suited to solving the test instance. Next, we propose how to use (additional invocations of) an LLM with prompted syntax constraints to automatically map the fragments to corresponding utterances. Finally, we adapt and extend a recent method for diverse ICE selection to work with whole and fragmented ICE instances. We evaluate our system, SCUD4ICL, on popular diverse semantic parsing benchmarks, showing visible accuracy gains from our proposed decomposed diverse demonstration method. Benefits are particularly notable for smaller LLMs, ICE pools having larger labeled trees, and programs in lower resource languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at NAACL 2025 (Main)</p></details> |

A prominent engineering challenge revolves around programming the collective adaptive behaviour of such computational ecosystems. This requires abstractions able to capture concepts like ensembles (dynamic groups of cooperating devices) and collective tasks (joint activities carried out by ensembles). In this work, we consider collections of devices interacting with neighbours and that execute in nearly-synchronised sense-compute-interact rounds, where the computation is given by a single program mapping sensing values and incoming messages to output and outcoming messages. To support programming whole computational collectives, we propose the abstraction of a distributed collective process, which can be used to define at once the ensemble formation logic and its collective task. We formalise the abstraction in the eXchange Calculus (XC), a core functional language based on neighbouring values (maps from neighbours to values) where state and interaction is handled through a single primitive, exchange, and provide a corresponding implementation in the FCPP language. Then, we exercise distributed collective processes using two case studies: multi-hop message propagation and distributed monitoring of spatial properties. Finally, we discuss the features of the abstraction and its suitability for different kinds of distributed computing applications.</p></details> | 41 pages, 17 figures |

Unlike traditional CAD model retrieval, shape programs allow reasoning about semantic parameters, editing, and a low memory footprint. Despite their potential, shape programs for 3D scene understanding have been largely overlooked. Our key contribution is enabling gradient-based optimization by parsing shape programs, or more precisely procedural models designed in Blender, into efficient PyTorch code. While there are many possible applications of our PyTochGeoNodes, we show that a combination of PyTorchGeoNodes with genetic algorithm is a method of choice to optimize both discrete and continuous shape program parameters for 3D reconstruction and understanding of 3D object parameters. Our modular framework can be further integrated with other reconstruction algorithms, and we demonstrate one such integration to enable procedural Gaussian splatting. Our experiments on the ScanNet dataset show that our method achieves accurate reconstructions while enabling, until now, unseen level of 3D scene understanding.</p></details> | Accepted at CVPR |

Building on DSP's paradigm shift from data-to-compute to compute-to-data, we formalize additional intrinsic language constructs that abstract persistent state, multi-user contexts, multiple entry points, and cross-machine distribution for applications. By introducing a globally accessible root node and treating walkers as potential entry points, we demonstrate how programs can be written once and executed across scales, from single-user to multi-user, from local to distributed, without modification. These extensions allow developers to focus on domain logic while delegating runtime concerns of persistence, multi-user support, distribution, and API interfacing to the execution environment. Our approach makes scale-agnostic programming a natural extension of the topological semantics of DSP, allowing applications to seamlessly transition from single-user to multi-user scenarios, from ephemeral to persistent execution contexts, and from local to distributed execution environments.</p></details> | 16 pages |

In response, hardware manufacturers have begun to incorporate so-called Neural Processing Units (NPUs) into their processors for consumer devices. Such dedicated hardware optimizes both power efficiency and throughput for common machine learning tasks. AMD's NPU, part of their Ryzen AI processors, is one of the first such accelerators integrated into a chip with an x86 processor. AMD supports bare-metal programming of their NPU rather than limiting programmers to pre-configured libraries. In this paper, we explore the potential of using a bare-metal toolchain to accelerate the weight fine-tuning of a large language model, GPT-2, entirely on the client side using the AMD NPU. Fine-tuning on the edge allows for private customization of a model to a specific use case. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such an accelerator has been used to perform training on the client side. We offload time-intensive matrix multiplication operations from the CPU onto the NPU, achieving a speedup of over 2.8x for these operations. This improves end-to-end performance of the model in terms of throughput (1.7x and 1.2x speedup in FLOPS/s on mains and battery power, respectively) and energy efficiency (1.4x improvement in FLOPS/Ws on battery power). We detail our implementation approach and present an in-depth exploration of the NPU hardware and bare-metal tool-flow.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures; abridged version to appear in the 33rd IEEE International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM), 2025</p></details> |

However, prior work primarily relies on few-shot in-context learning (ICL) with ad-hoc demonstrations, which limit program diversity and require manual design with substantial domain knowledge. Fundamentally, the underlying principles of effective reasoning program generation still remain underexplored, making it challenging to construct effective demonstrations. To address this, we propose BOOST, a bootstrapping-based framework for few-shot reasoning program generation. BOOST explicitly integrates claim decomposition and information-gathering strategies as structural guidance for program generation, iteratively refining bootstrapped demonstrations in a strategy-driven and data-centric manner without human intervention. This enables a seamless transition from zero-shot to few-shot strategic program-guided learning, enhancing interpretability and effectiveness. Experimental results show that BOOST outperforms prior few-shot baselines in both zero-shot and few-shot settings for complex claim verification.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |

However, current LLM-based approaches predominantly focus on mainstream programming languages like Java and Python, neglecting less prevalent but emerging languages such as Rust due to expensive training resources, limited datasets, and insufficient community support. This narrow focus creates a significant gap in repair capabilities across the programming language spectrum, where the full potential of LLMs for comprehensive multilingual program repair remains largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel cross-language program repair approach LANTERN that leverages LLMs' differential proficiency across languages through a multi-agent iterative repair paradigm. Our technique strategically translates defective code from languages where LLMs exhibit weaker repair capabilities to languages where they demonstrate stronger performance, without requiring additional training. A key innovation of our approach is an LLM-based decision-making system that dynamically selects optimal target languages based on bug characteristics and continuously incorporates feedback from previous repair attempts. We evaluate our method on xCodeEval, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 5,068 bugs across 11 programming languages. Results demonstrate significant enhancement in repair effectiveness, particularly for underrepresented languages, with Rust showing a 22.09% improvement in Pass@10 metrics. Our research provides the first empirical evidence that cross-language translation significantly expands the repair capabilities of LLMs and effectively bridges the performance gap between programming languages with different levels of popularity, opening new avenues for truly language-agnostic automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[C*: Unifying Programming and Verification in C](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02246v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the correct functionality of systems software, given its safety-critical and low-level nature, is a primary focus in formal verification research and applications. Despite advances in verification tooling, conventional programmers are rarely involved in the verification of their own code, resulting in higher development and maintenance costs for verified software. A key barrier to programmer participation in verification practices is the disconnect of environments and paradigms between programming and verification practices, which limits accessibility and real-time verification. We introduce C*, a proof-integrated language design for C programming. C* extends C with verification capabilities, powered by a symbolic execution engine and an LCF-style proof kernel. It enables real-time verification by allowing programmers to embed proof-code blocks alongside implementation code, facilitating interactive updates to the current proof state. Its expressive and extensible proof support allows users to build reusable libraries of logical definitions, theorems, and programmable proof automation. Crucially, C* unifies implementation and proof code development by using C as the common language. We implemented a prototype of C* and evaluated it on a representative benchmark of small C programs and a challenging real-world case study: the attach function of pKVM's buddy allocator. Our results demonstrate that C* supports the verification of a broad subset of C programming idioms and effectively handles complex reasoning tasks in real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

While QA has shown promise in solving binary problems such as those expressed in Ising or QUBO form, its direct applicability to real-valued domains remains limited. QESA bridges this gap by using QA to select discrete search directions that guide SA through the continuous solution space, enabling the use of quantum resources without requiring full problem discretization. We demonstrate QESA's effectiveness on box-constrained quadratic programming (QP) problems, a class of non-convex optimization tasks that frequently arise in practice. Experimental results show that QESA consistently outperforms classical baselines in solution quality, particularly on larger and more ill-conditioned problems, while maintaining competitive runtime. As quantum annealing hardware matures, QESA offers a scalable and flexible strategy for leveraging quantum capabilities in continuous optimization.</p></details> | 21 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Enhancing LLMs in Long Code Translation through Instrumentation and Program State Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02017v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation aims to transform code between programming languages while preserving functionality, with applications in cross-platform development and software migration. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have improved code translation, but challenges remain, particularly in inferring program functionality. These issues worsen with longer and more complex code, where current LLMs struggle to handle length and intricate semantics. To evaluate LLMs on long code translation, we introduce LongTrans, a large-scale execution-based benchmark with C++, Java, and Python programs, ranging from hundreds to thousands of tokens. Our empirical study of 12 LLMs reveals a sharp performance decline as code length increases, with even the best-performing model, GPT-4o, achieving only 57.51% computational accuracy. This highlights the need for further research in long code translation. We argue that code translation should maintain invariant functionality while transforming syntax and keywords across languages. Despite differences in appearance, program states should remain consistent throughout execution. To address this, we propose PAST (Program State Alignment augmented Translation), which integrates instrumentation to capture and align program states during translation. This approach is the first to leverage LLMs to insert instrumentation in both original and translated code, tracing program states at runtime. By prompting the LLM to correct errors based on output traces, we mitigate inconsistencies and enhance translation accuracy. Experimental results show significant improvements, with computational accuracy rising from 57.51% to 84.70% for GPT-4o, 50.68% to 69.97% for Mistral-Large-2, and 52.45% to 76.43% for DeepSeek-Coder-V2. These improvements are consistent across models and datasets, with ablation studies confirming the benefits of instrumentation and state alignment.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Adapting Knowledge Prompt Tuning for Enhanced Automated Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01523v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to enhance software reliability by automatically generating bug-fixing patches. Recent work has improved the state-of-the-art of APR by fine-tuning pre-trained large language models (LLMs), such as CodeT5, for APR. However, the effectiveness of fine-tuning becomes weakened in data scarcity scenarios, and data scarcity can be a common issue in practice, limiting fine-tuning performance. To alleviate this limitation, this paper adapts prompt tuning for enhanced APR and conducts a comprehensive study to evaluate its effectiveness in data scarcity scenarios, using three LLMs of different sizes and six diverse datasets across four programming languages. Prompt tuning rewrites the input to a model by adding extra prompt tokens and tunes both the model and the prompts on a small dataset. These tokens provide task-specific knowledge that can improve the model for APR, which is especially critical in data scarcity scenarios. Moreover, domain knowledge has proven crucial in many code intelligence tasks, but existing studies fail to leverage domain knowledge during the prompt tuning for APR. To close this gap, we introduce knowledge prompt tuning, an approach that adapts prompt tuning with six distinct types of code- or bug-related domain knowledge for APR. Our work, to the best of our knowledge, is the first to adapt and evaluate prompt tuning and the effectiveness of code- or bug-related domain knowledge for APR, particularly under data scarcity settings. Our evaluation results demonstrate that prompt tuning with knowledge generally outperforms fine-tuning under various experimental settings, achieving an average improvement of 87.33% over fine-tuning in data scarcity scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integer Programming for Learning Directed Acyclic Graphs from Non-identifiable Gaussian Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12592v3)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of learning directed acyclic graphs from continuous observational data, generated according to a linear Gaussian structural equation model. State-of-the-art structure learning methods for this setting have at least one of the following shortcomings: i) they cannot provide optimality guarantees and can suffer from learning sub-optimal models; ii) they rely on the stringent assumption that the noise is homoscedastic, and hence the underlying model is fully identifiable. We overcome these shortcomings and develop a computationally efficient mixed-integer programming framework for learning medium-sized problems that accounts for arbitrary heteroscedastic noise. We present an early stopping criterion under which we can terminate the branch-and-bound procedure to achieve an asymptotically optimal solution and establish the consistency of this approximate solution. In addition, we show via numerical experiments that our method outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms and is robust to noise heteroscedasticity, whereas the performance of some competing methods deteriorates under strong violations of the identifiability assumption. The software implementation of our method is available as the Python package \emph{micodag}.</p></details> |  |
| **[Facilitating Instructors-LLM Collaboration for Problem Design in Introductory Programming Classrooms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01259v1)** | 2025-04-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, offer significant opportunities to enhance instructional support in introductory programming courses. While extensive research has explored the effectiveness of LLMs in supporting student learning, limited studies have examined how these models can assist instructors in designing instructional activities. This work investigates how instructors' expertise in effective activity design can be integrated with LLMs' ability to generate novel and targeted programming problems, facilitating more effective activity creation for programming classrooms. To achieve this, we employ a participatory design approach to develop an instructor-authoring tool that incorporates LLM support, fostering collaboration between instructors and AI in generating programming exercises. This tool also allows instructors to specify common student mistakes and misconceptions, which informs the adaptive feedback generation process. We conduct case studies with three instructors, analyzing how they use our system to design programming problems for their introductory courses. Through these case studies, we assess instructors' perceptions of the usefulness and limitations of LLMs in authoring problem statements for instructional purposes. Additionally, we compare the efficiency, quality, effectiveness, and coverage of designed activities when instructors create problems with and without structured LLM prompting guidelines. Our findings provide insights into the potential of LLMs in enhancing instructor workflows and improving programming education and provide guidelines for designing effective AI-assisted problem-authoring interfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CHI 2025 Workshop on Augmented Educators and AI: Shaping the Future of Human and AI Cooperation in Learning</p></details> |

This is particularly true for the potential of LLMs to generate formative programming feedback for novice learners at university. In contrast to Generative AI (GenAI) tools based on LLMs, such as GPT, smaller and open models have received much less attention. Yet, they offer several benefits, as educators can let them run on a virtual machine or personal computer. This can help circumvent some major concerns applicable to other GenAI tools and LLMs (e. g., data protection, lack of control over changes, privacy). Therefore, this study explores the feedback characteristics of the open, lightweight LLM Llama 3.2 (3B). In particular, we investigate the models' responses to authentic student solutions to introductory programming exercises written in Java. The generated output is qualitatively analyzed to help evaluate the feedback's quality, content, structure, and other features. The results provide a comprehensive overview of the feedback capabilities and serious shortcomings of this open, small LLM. We further discuss the findings in the context of previous research on LLMs and contribute to benchmarking recently available GenAI tools and their feedback for novice learners of programming. Thereby, this work has implications for educators, learners, and tool developers attempting to utilize all variants of LLMs (including open, and small models) to generate formative feedback and support learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to the International Journal of Engineering Pedagogy (iJEP; eISSN: 2192-4880)</p></details> |

It is an invaluable tool for signal processing and machine learning, because many key metrics in these fields are fractionally structured, e.g., the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in wireless communications, the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) in radar sensing, the normalized cut in graph clustering, and the margin in support vector machine (SVM). This article provides a comprehensive review of both the theory and applications of a recently developed FP technique known as the quadratic transform, which can be applied to a wide variety of FP problems, including both the minimization and the maximization of the sum of functions of ratios as well as matrix-ratio problems.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Curriculum Design of Competitive Programming: a Contest-based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.00533v1)** | 2025-04-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competitive programming (CP) has been increasingly integrated into computer science curricula worldwide due to its efficacy in enhancing students' algorithmic reasoning and problem-solving skills. However, existing CP curriculum designs predominantly employ a problem-based approach, lacking the critical dimension of time pressure of real competitive programming contests. Such constraints are prevalent not only in programming contests but also in various real-world scenarios, including technical interviews, software development sprints, and hackathons. To bridge this gap, we introduce a contest-based approach to curriculum design that explicitly incorporates realistic contest scenarios into formative assessments, simulating authentic competitive programming experiences. This paper details the design and implementation of such a course at Purdue University, structured to systematically develop students' observational skills, algorithmic techniques, and efficient coding and debugging practices. We outline a pedagogical framework comprising cooperative learning strategies, contest-based assessments, and supplemental activities to boost students' problem-solving capabilities.</p></details> |  |

The primary use case for cozy is validating "micropatches": small binary or assembly-level patches inserted into existing compiled binaries. To perform this task, cozy leverages the Python-based angr symbolic execution framework. Our tool analyzes the output of symbolic execution to find end states for the pre- and post-patched binaries that are compatible (reachable from the same input). The tool then compares compatible states for observable differences in registers, memory, and side effects. To aid in usability, cozy comes with a web-based visual interface for viewing comparison results. This interface provides a rich set of operations for pruning, filtering, and exploring different types of program data.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in the proceedings of the Workshop on Binary Analysis Research (BAR) 2025, winner of the BAR 2025 distinguished paper award</p></details> |

Based on the duality principle, we first show that the feasibility of a QP can be determined by the solution of a properly-defined Linear Program (LP). Our analysis yields a LP that can be solved more efficiently compared to the original QP problem, and more importantly, is simpler in form and can be solved more efficiently compared to existing methods that assess feasibility via LPs. The computational efficiency of the proposed method compared to existing methods for feasibility evaluation is demonstrated in comparative case studies as well as a feasible-constraint selection problem, indicating its promise for online feasibility evaluation of optimization-based controllers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to CDC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Machine Learning for Identifying Potential Participants in Uruguayan Social Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.01045v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This research project explores the optimization of the family selection process for participation in Uruguay's Crece Contigo Family Support Program (PAF) through machine learning. An anonymized database of 15,436 previous referral cases was analyzed, focusing on pregnant women and children under four years of age. The main objective was to develop a predictive algorithm capable of determining whether a family meets the conditions for acceptance into the program. The implementation of this model seeks to streamline the evaluation process and allow for more efficient resource allocation, allocating more team time to direct support. The study included an exhaustive data analysis and the implementation of various machine learning models, including Neural Networks (NN), XGBoost (XGB), LSTM, and ensemble models. Techniques to address class imbalance, such as SMOTE and RUS, were applied, as well as decision threshold optimization to improve prediction accuracy and balance. The results demonstrate the potential of these techniques for efficient classification of families requiring assistance.</p></details> | in Spanish language |
| **[ObfusQate: Unveiling the First Quantum Program Obfuscation Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.23785v1)** | 2025-03-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces ObfusQate, a novel tool that conducts obfuscations using quantum primitives to enhance the security of both classical and quantum programs. We have designed and implemented two primary categories of obfuscations: quantum circuit level obfuscation and code level obfuscation, encompassing a total of eight distinct methods. Quantum circuit-level obfuscation leverages on quantum gates and circuits, utilizing strategies such as quantum gate hiding and identity matrices to construct complex, non-intuitive circuits that effectively obscure core functionalities and resist reverse engineering, making the underlying code difficult to interpret. Meanwhile, code-level obfuscation manipulates the logical sequence of program operations through quantum-based opaque predicates, obfuscating execution paths and rendering program behavior more unpredictable and challenging to analyze. Additionally, ObfusQate can be used to obfuscate malicious code segments, making them harder to detect and analyze. These advancements establish a foundational framework for further exploration into the potential and limitations of quantum-based obfuscation techniques, positioning ObfusQate as a valuable tool for future developers to enhance code security in the evolving landscape of software development. To the best of our knowledge, ObfusQate represents the pioneering work in developing an automated framework for implementing obfuscations leveraging quantum primitives. Security evaluations show that obfuscations by ObfusQate maintain code behavior with polynomial overheads in space and time complexities. We have also demonstrated an offensive use case by embedding a keylogger into Shor's algorithm and obfuscating it using ObfusQate. Our results show that current Large language models like GPT 4o, GPT o3 mini and Grok 3 were not able to identify the malicious keylogger after obfuscation.</p></details> |  |
