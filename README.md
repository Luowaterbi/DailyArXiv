| **[Ultra-Low-Latency Edge Intelligent Sensing: A Source-Channel Tradeoff and Its Application to Coding Rate Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04645v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) mobile network is set to merge edge artificial intelligence (AI) and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) extensively, giving rise to the new paradigm of edge intelligent sensing (EI-Sense). This paradigm leverages ubiquitous edge devices for environmental sensing and deploys AI algorithms at edge servers to interpret the observations via remote inference on wirelessly uploaded features. A significant challenge arises in designing EI-Sense systems for 6G mission-critical applications, which demand high performance under stringent latency constraints. To tackle this challenge, we focus on the end-to-end (E2E) performance of EI-Sense and characterize a source-channel tradeoff that balances source distortion and channel reliability. In this work, we establish a theoretical foundation for the source-channel tradeoff by quantifying the effects of source coding on feature discriminant gains and channel reliability on packet loss. Building on this foundation, we design the coding rate control by optimizing the tradeoff to minimize the E2E sensing error probability, leading to a low-complexity algorithm for ultra-low-latency EI-Sense. Finally, we validate our theoretical analysis and proposed coding rate control algorithm through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating the sensing performance gain of our approach with respect to traditional reliability-centric methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivalence of Families of Polycyclic Codes over Finite Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04498v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the equivalence of families of polycyclic codes associated with polynomials of the form $x^n - a_{n-1}x^{n-1} - \ldots - a_1x - a_0$ over a finite field. We begin with the specific case of polycyclic codes associated with a trinomial $x^n - a_{\ell} x^{\ell} - a_0$ (for some $0< \ell <n$), which we refer to as \textit{$\ell$-trinomial codes}, after which we generalize our results to general polycyclic codes. We introduce an equivalence relation called \textit{$n$-equivalence}, which extends the known notion of $n$-equivalence for constacyclic codes \cite{Chen2014}. We compute the number of $n$-equivalence classes %, $ N_{(n,\ell)}$, for this relation and provide conditions under which two families of polycyclic (or $\ell$-trinomial) codes are equivalent. In particular, we prove that when $\gcd(n, n-\ell) = 1$, any $\ell$-trinomial code family is equivalent to a trinomial code family associated with the polynomial $x^n - x^{\ell} - 1$. Finally, we focus on $p^{\ell}$-trinomial codes of length $p^{\ell+r}$, where $p$ is the characteristic of $\mathbb{F}_q$ and $r$ an integer, and provide some examples as an application of the theory developed in this paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exit the Code: A Model for Understanding Career Abandonment Intention Among Software Developers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04460v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background. Career abandonment, the process in which professionals leave the activity, assuming positions in another area, among software developers involves frustration with the lost investment and emotional and financial costs, even though being beneficial for the human being, depending on personal context. Previous studies have identified work-related motivators for career abandonment, such as the threat of obsolescence, unstable requirements, and low code quality, though these factors have primarily been examined in former developers. The relationship between these motivators and the intention to abandon among currently active developers remains unexplored. Goal. This article investigates the relationship between key work-related motivators and currently active software developers intention to abandon their careers. Method. We employed a quantitative approach, surveying 221 software developers to validate a theoretical model for career abandonment intention, based on an adaptation of the Investment Model, which incorporates satisfaction with technical aspects of the profession as well as the intention to abandon. Findings. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, through structural equation modeling (SEM), provided robust support for the adapted Investment Model in explaining software developers intention to abandon their careers. Moreover, career commitment significantly impacts the intention to leave the profession, being positively influenced by satisfaction with technical work-related factors and negatively influenced by career alternatives and career investment. Conclusion. The paper offers valuable insights for organizational leaders and research, potentially guiding retention strategies to better support developers, and the adoption of theoretical models to explain career abandonment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Transformer-based World Models with Contrastive Predictive Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04416v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The DreamerV3 algorithm recently obtained remarkable performance across diverse environment domains by learning an accurate world model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Following the success of model-based reinforcement learning algorithms and the rapid adoption of the Transformer architecture for its superior training efficiency and favorable scaling properties, recent works such as STORM have proposed replacing RNN-based world models with Transformer-based world models using masked self-attention. However, despite the improved training efficiency of these methods, their impact on performance remains limited compared to the Dreamer algorithm, struggling to learn competitive Transformer-based world models. In this work, we show that the next state prediction objective adopted in previous approaches is insufficient to fully exploit the representation capabilities of Transformers. We propose to extend world model predictions to longer time horizons by introducing TWISTER (Transformer-based World model wIth contraSTivE Representations), a world model using action-conditioned Contrastive Predictive Coding to learn high-level temporal feature representations and improve the agent performance. TWISTER achieves a human-normalized mean score of 162% on the Atari 100k benchmark, setting a new record among state-of-the-art methods that do not employ look-ahead search.</p></details> |  |
| **[LONGCODEU: Benchmarking Long-Context Language Models on Long Code Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04359v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current advanced long-context language models offer great potential for real-world software engineering applications. However, progress in this critical domain remains hampered by a fundamental limitation: the absence of a rigorous evaluation framework for long code understanding. To gap this obstacle, we propose a long code understanding benchmark LONGCODEU from four aspects (8 tasks) to evaluate LCLMs' long code understanding ability required for practical applications, including code unit perception, intra-code unit understanding, inter-code unit relation understanding, and long code documentation understanding. We evaluate 9 popular LCLMs on LONGCODEU (i.e., 6 general models and 3 code models). Our experimental results reveal key limitations in current LCLMs' capabilities for long code understanding. Particularly, the performance of LCLMs drops dramatically when the long code length is greater than 32K, falling far short of their claimed 128K-1M context windows. In the four aspects, inter-code unit relation understanding is the most challenging for LCLMs. Our study provides valuable insights for optimizing LCLMs and driving advancements in software engineering.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[scDD: Latent Codes Based scRNA-seq Dataset Distillation with Foundation Model Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04357v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology has profiled hundreds of millions of human cells across organs, diseases, development and perturbations to date. However, the high-dimensional sparsity, batch effect noise, category imbalance, and ever-increasing data scale of the original sequencing data pose significant challenges for multi-center knowledge transfer, data fusion, and cross-validation between scRNA-seq datasets. To address these barriers, (1) we first propose a latent codes-based scRNA-seq dataset distillation framework named scDD, which transfers and distills foundation model knowledge and original dataset information into a compact latent space and generates synthetic scRNA-seq dataset by a generator to replace the original dataset. Then, (2) we propose a single-step conditional diffusion generator named SCDG, which perform single-step gradient back-propagation to help scDD optimize distillation quality and avoid gradient decay caused by multi-step back-propagation. Meanwhile, SCDG ensures the scRNA-seq data characteristics and inter-class discriminability of the synthetic dataset through flexible conditional control and generation quality assurance. Finally, we propose a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of scRNA-seq dataset distillation in different data analysis tasks. It is validated that our proposed method can achieve 7.61% absolute and 15.70% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods on average task.</p></details> |  |
| **[KidneyTalk-open: No-code Deployment of a Private Large Language Model with Medical Documentation-Enhanced Knowledge Database for Kidney Disease](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04153v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Privacy-preserving medical decision support for kidney disease requires localized deployment of large language models (LLMs) while maintaining clinical reasoning capabilities. Current solutions face three challenges: 1) Cloud-based LLMs pose data security risks; 2) Local model deployment demands technical expertise; 3) General LLMs lack mechanisms to integrate medical knowledge. Retrieval-augmented systems also struggle with medical document processing and clinical usability. We developed KidneyTalk-open, a desktop system integrating three technical components: 1) No-code deployment of state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source LLMs (such as DeepSeek-r1, Qwen2.5) via local inference engine; 2) Medical document processing pipeline combining context-aware chunking and intelligent filtering; 3) Adaptive Retrieval and Augmentation Pipeline (AddRep) employing agents collaboration for improving the recall rate of medical documents. A graphical interface was designed to enable clinicians to manage medical documents and conduct AI-powered consultations without technical expertise. Experimental validation on 1,455 challenging nephrology exam questions demonstrates AddRep's effectiveness: achieving 29.1% accuracy (+8.1% over baseline) with intelligent knowledge integration, while maintaining robustness through 4.9% rejection rate to suppress hallucinations. Comparative case studies with the mainstream products (AnythingLLM, Chatbox, GPT4ALL) demonstrate KidneyTalk-open's superior performance in real clinical query. KidneyTalk-open represents the first no-code medical LLM system enabling secure documentation-enhanced medical Q&A on desktop. Its designs establishes a new framework for privacy-sensitive clinical AI applications. The system significantly lowers technical barriers while improving evidence traceability, enabling more medical staff or patients to use SOTA open-source LLMs conveniently.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corresponding authors: zhanglx@bjmu.edu.cn; joy_yuxi@pku.edu.cn; hongshenda@pku.edu.cn</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Benchmarking of Reasoning Capabilities in Code Large Language Models Under Data Contamination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04149v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of code largelanguage models underscores the need for effective and transparent benchmarking of their reasoning capabilities. However, the current benchmarking approach heavily depends on publicly available, human-created datasets. The widespread use of these fixed benchmark datasets makes the benchmarking process to be static and thus particularly susceptible to data contamination, an unavoidable consequence of the extensive data collection processes used to train Code LLMs. Existing approaches that address data contamination often suffer from human effort limitations and imbalanced problem complexity. To tackle these challenges, we propose \tool, a novel benchmarking suite for evaluating Code LLMs under potential data contamination. Given a seed programming problem, \tool employs multiple agents to extract and modify the context without altering the core logic, generating semantically equivalent variations. We introduce a dynamic data generation methods and conduct empirical studies on two seed datasets across 21 Code LLMs. Results show that \tool effectively benchmarks reasoning capabilities under contamination risks while generating diverse problem sets to ensure consistent and reliable evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://codekaleidoscope.github.io/dycodeeval.html</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Memorization: Evaluating the True Type Inference Capabilities of LLMs for Java Code Snippets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04076v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Type inference is a crucial task for reusing online code snippets, often found on platforms like StackOverflow, which frequently lack essential type information such as fully qualified names (FQNs) and required libraries. Recent studies have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for type inference on code snippets, showing promising results. However, these results are potentially affected by data leakage, as the benchmark suite (StatType-SO) has been public on GitHub since 2017 (full suite in 2023). Thus, it is uncertain whether LLMs' strong performance reflects genuine code semantics understanding or a mere retrieval of ground truth from training data. To comprehensively assess LLMs' type inference capabilities on Java code snippets, we conducted a three-pronged evaluation. First, utilizing Thalia, a program synthesis technique, we created ThaliaType--a new, unseen dataset for type inference evaluation. On unseen snippets, LLM performance dropped significantly, with up to a 59% decrease in precision and 72% in recall. Second, we developed semantic-preserving transformations that significantly degraded LLMs' type inference performance, revealing weaknesses in understanding code semantics. Third, we used delta debugging to identify the minimal syntax elements sufficient for LLM inference. While type inference primarily involves inferring FQNs for types in the code snippet, LLMs correctly infer FQNs even when the types were absent from the snippets, suggesting a reliance on knowledge from training instead of thoroughly analyzing the snippets. Our findings indicate that LLMs' strong past performance likely stemmed from data leakage, rather than a genuine understanding of the semantics of code snippets. Our findings highlight the crucial need for carefully designed benchmarks using unseen code snippets to assess the true capabilities of LLMs for type inference tasks.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Code-Verification Techniques for an Arbitrary-Depth Electromagnetic Slot Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04004v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electromagnetic penetration through openings in an otherwise closed electromagnetic scatterer is an important topic in computational electromagnetics. To efficiently model this phenomenon, aperture or slot models are often used in conjunction with surface integral equations to solve Maxwell's equations. To establish the credibility of these models, code verification is necessary to assess the correctness of the implementation of the underlying numerical methods. However, many characteristics of surface integral equations and slot models render traditional code-verification approaches ineffective. In this paper, we present approaches to separately measure the different sources of numerical error arising from the method-of-moments implementation of the electric-field integral equation with an arbitrary-depth slot model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches for several cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2406.14573</p></details> |
| **[AI-based Programming Assistants for Privacy-related Code Generation: The Developers' Experience](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03988v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the popularising of generative AI, the existence of AI-based programming assistants for developers is no surprise. Developers increasingly use them for their work, including generating code to fulfil the data protection requirements (privacy) of the apps they build. We wanted to know if the reality is the same as expectations of AI-based programming assistants when trying to fulfil software privacy requirements, and the challenges developers face when using AI-based programming assistants and how these can be improved. To this end, we conducted a survey with 51 developers worldwide. We found that AI-based programming assistants need to be improved in order for developers to better trust them with generating code that ensures privacy. In this paper, we provide some practical recommendations for developers to consider following when using AI-based programming assistants for privacy-related code development, and some key further research directions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trim My View: An LLM-Based Code Query System for Module Retrieval in Robotic Firmware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03969v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The software compilation process has a tendency to obscure the original design of the system and makes it difficult both to identify individual components and discern their purpose simply by examining the resulting binary code. Although decompilation techniques attempt to recover higher-level source code from the machine code in question, they are not fully able to restore the semantics of the original functions. Furthermore, binaries are often stripped of metadata, and this makes it challenging to reverse engineer complex binary software. In this paper we show how a combination of binary decomposition techniques, decompilation passes, and LLM-powered function summarization can be used to build an economical engine to identify modules in stripped binaries and associate them with high-level natural language descriptions. We instantiated this technique with three underlying open-source LLMs -- CodeQwen, DeepSeek-Coder and CodeStral -- and measured its effectiveness in identifying modules in robotics firmware. This experimental evaluation involved 467 modules from four devices from the ArduPilot software suite, and showed that CodeStral, the best-performing backend LLM, achieves an average F1-score of 0.68 with an online running time of just a handful of seconds.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Construction and Decoding of Quantum Margulis Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03936v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum low-density parity-check codes are a promising approach to fault-tolerant quantum computation, offering potential advantages in rate and decoding efficiency. In this work, we introduce quantum Margulis codes, a new class of QLDPC codes derived from Margulis' classical LDPC construction via the two-block group algebra framework. We show that quantum Margulis codes, unlike bivariate bicycle codes which require ordered statistics decoding for effective error correction, can be efficiently decoded using a standard min-sum decoder with linear complexity, when decoded under depolarizing noise. This is attributed to their Tanner graph structure, which does not exhibit group symmetry, thereby mitigating the well-known problem of error degeneracy in QLDPC decoding. To further enhance performance, we propose an algorithm for constructing 2BGA codes with controlled girth, ensuring a minimum girth of 6 or 8, and use it to generate several quantum Margulis codes of length 240 and 642. We validate our approach through numerical simulations, demonstrating that quantum Margulis codes behave significantly better than BB codes in the error floor region, under min-sum decoding.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures.

| **[Assessing Correctness in LLM-Based Code Generation via Uncertainty Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11620v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we explore uncertainty estimation as a proxy for correctness in LLM-generated code. To this end, we adapt two state-of-the-art techniques from natural language generation -- one based on entropy and another on mutual information -- to the domain of code generation. Given the distinct semantic properties of code, we introduce modifications, including a semantic equivalence check based on symbolic execution. Our findings indicate a strong correlation between the uncertainty computed through these techniques and correctness, highlighting the potential of uncertainty estimation for quality assessment. Additionally, we propose a simplified version of the entropy-based method that assumes a uniform distribution over the LLM's responses, demonstrating comparable effectiveness. Using these techniques, we develop an abstention policy that prevents the model from making predictions when uncertainty is high, reducing incorrect outputs to near zero. Our evaluation on the LiveCodeBench shows that our approach significantly outperforms a baseline relying solely on LLM-reported log-probabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages and 3 References Pages</p></details> |

| **[Word2Wave: Language Driven Mission Programming for Efficient Subsea Deployments of Marine Robots](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.18405v2)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper explores the design and development of a language-based interface for dynamic mission programming of autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs). The proposed `Word2Wave' (W2W) framework enables interactive programming and parameter configuration of AUVs for remote subsea missions. The W2W framework includes: (i) a set of novel language rules and command structures for efficient language-to-mission mapping; (ii) a GPT-based prompt engineering module for training data generation; (iii) a small language model (SLM)-based sequence-to-sequence learning pipeline for mission command generation from human speech or text; and (iv) a novel user interface for 2D mission map visualization and human-machine interfacing. The proposed learning pipeline adapts an SLM named T5-Small that can learn language-to-mission mapping from processed language data effectively, providing robust and efficient performance. In addition to a benchmark evaluation with state-of-the-art, we conduct a user interaction study to demonstrate the effectiveness of W2W over commercial AUV programming interfaces. Across participants, W2W-based programming required less than 10\% time for mission programming compared to traditional interfaces; it is deemed to be a simpler and more natural paradigm for subsea mission programming with a usability score of 76.25. W2W opens up promising future research opportunities on hands-free AUV mission programming for efficient subsea deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modular Reasoning about Error Bounds for Concurrent Probabilistic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04512v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Coneris, the first higher-order concurrent separation logic for reasoning about error probability bounds of higher-order concurrent probabilistic programs with higher-order state. To support modular reasoning about concurrent (non-probabilistic) program modules, state-of-the-art program logics internalize the classic notion of linearizability within the logic through the concept of logical atomicity. Coneris extends this idea to probabilistic concurrent program modules. Thus Coneris supports modular reasoning about probabilistic concurrent modules by capturing a novel notion of randomized logical atomicity within the logic. To do so, Coneris utilizes presampling tapes and a novel probabilistic update modality to describe how state is changed probabilistically at linearization points. We demonstrate this approach by means of smaller synthetic examples and larger case studies. All of the presented results, including the meta-theory, have been mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant and the Iris separation logic framework</p></details> |  |

Empirical observations show that current systems tend to produce incomplete next object location distributions. We introduce a system which addresses this problem. We design a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that specifies functional constraints. Programs from our language take as input a partial scene and object to place. Upon execution they predict possible object placements. We design a generative model which writes these programs automatically. Available 3D scene datasets do not contain programs to train on, so we build upon previous work in unsupervised program induction to introduce a new program bootstrapping algorithm. In order to quantify our empirical observations we introduce a new evaluation procedure which captures how well a system models per-object location distributions. We ask human annotators to label all the possible places an object can go in a scene and show that our system produces per-object location distributions more consistent with human annotators. Our system also generates indoor scenes of comparable quality to previous systems and while previous systems degrade in performance when training data is sparse, our system does not degrade to the same degree.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 20 figures Subjects: Graphics (cs.GR), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Machine Learning (cs.LG)</p></details> |

This highlights a need to teach students how to effectively interact with AI models, particularly through natural language prompts, to generate and critically evaluate code for solving computational tasks. To address this, we developed a novel platform for prompt programming that enables authentic dialogue-based interactions, supports problems involving multiple interdependent functions, and offers on-request execution of generated code. Data analysis from over 900 students in an introductory programming course revealed high engagement, with the majority of prompts occurring within multi-turn dialogues. Problems with multiple interdependent functions encouraged iterative refinement, with progression graphs highlighting several common strategies. Students were highly selective about the code they chose to test, suggesting that on-request execution of generated code promoted critical thinking. Given the growing importance of learning dialogue-based programming with AI, we provide this tool as a publicly accessible resource, accompanied by a corpus of programming problems for educational use.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of the ITiCSE'25 paper</p></details> |

Recently, Memory-Safe WebAssembly (MSWASM) is introduced as a general-purpose intermediate bytecode with built-in memory safety semantics. Programs written in C can be compiled into MSWASM to get complete memory safety protection. In this paper, we present our extensions on MSWASM, which improve its semantics and practicality. First, we formalize MSWASM semantics in Coq/Iris, extending it with inter-module interaction, showing that MSWASM provides fine-grained isolation guarantees analogous to WASM's coarse-grained isolation via linear memory. Second, we present Aegis, a system to adopt the memory safety of MSWASM for C programs in an interoperable way. Aegis pipeline generates Checked C source code from MSWASM modules to enforce spatial memory safety. Checked C is a recent binary-compatible extension of C which can provide guaranteed spatial safety. Our design allows Aegis to protect C programs that depend on legacy C libraries with no extra dependency and with low overhead. Aegis pipeline incurs 67% runtime overhead and near-zero memory overhead on PolyBenchC programs compared to native.</p></details> |  |
| **[DrugAgent: Automating AI-aided Drug Discovery Programming through LLM Multi-Agent Collaboration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.15692v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in Large Language Models (LLMs) has drawn attention to their potential for accelerating drug discovery. However, a central problem remains: translating theoretical ideas into robust implementations in the highly specialized context of pharmaceutical research. This limitation prevents practitioners from making full use of the latest AI developments in drug discovery. To address this challenge, we introduce DrugAgent, a multi-agent framework that automates machine learning (ML) programming for drug discovery tasks. DrugAgent employs an LLM Planner that formulates high-level ideas and an LLM Instructor that identifies and integrates domain knowledge when implementing those ideas. We present case studies on three representative drug discovery tasks. Our results show that DrugAgent consistently outperforms leading baselines, including a relative improvement of 4.92% in ROC-AUC compared to ReAct for drug-target interaction (DTI). DrugAgent is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/drugagent-5C42/.</p></details> |  |

For the overall system dynamics, a two-degrees-of-freedom (2-DOF) vehicle model is established and a two-point preview driver model is adopted. A dynamic authority allocation strategy based on cooperation level is proposed to combine the steering input of the human driver and the automatic controller. To make further improvements in the controller design, three main contributions are put forward. Firstly, the CNF controller is designed for trajectory tracking control with refined transient performance. Besides, the self-triggered rule is applied such that the system will update in discrete times to save computing resources and increase efficiency. Moreover, by introducing the data-based ADP algorithm, the optimal control problem can be solved through iteration using system input and output information, reducing the need for accurate knowledge of system dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is validated through Carsim-Simulink co-simulations in diverse driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics (12 pages)</p></details> |

| **[ArcPro: Architectural Programs for Structured 3D Abstraction of Sparse Points](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02745v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ArcPro, a novel learning framework built on architectural programs to recover structured 3D abstractions from highly sparse and low-quality point clouds. Specifically, we design a domain-specific language (DSL) to hierarchically represent building structures as a program, which can be efficiently converted into a mesh. We bridge feedforward and inverse procedural modeling by using a feedforward process for training data synthesis, allowing the network to make reverse predictions. We train an encoder-decoder on the points-program pairs to establish a mapping from unstructured point clouds to architectural programs, where a 3D convolutional encoder extracts point cloud features and a transformer decoder autoregressively predicts the programs in a tokenized form. Inference by our method is highly efficient and produces plausible and faithful 3D abstractions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ArcPro outperforms both traditional architectural proxy reconstruction and learning-based abstraction methods.

The while-language we consider is a simple computation model that can simulate (and be simulated by) Turing machines with a linear time and constant space blow-up. Our framework derives while-programs from functional programs written in a subset of Isabelle/HOL, namely tail-recursive functions with first-order arguments and algebraic datatypes. As far as we are aware, it is the first framework targeting a computation model that is reasonable in time and space from a complexity-theoretic perspective.</p></details> |  |
| **[ESSPI: ECDSA/Schnorr Signed Program Input for BitVMX](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02772v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The BitVM and BitVMX protocols have long relied on inefficient one-time signature (OTS) schemes like Lamport and Winternitz for signing program inputs. These schemes exhibit significant storage overheads, hindering their practical application. This paper introduces ESSPI, an optimized method leveraging ECDSA/Schnorr signatures to sign the BitVMX program input. With Schnorr signatures we achieve an optimal 1:1 data expansion, compared to the current known best ratio of 1:200 based on Winternitz signatures. To accomplish this we introduce 4 innovations to BitVMX: (1) a modification of the BitVMX CPU, adding a challengeable hashing core to it, (2) a new partition-based search to detect fraud during hashing, (3) a new enhanced transaction DAG with added data-carrying transactions with a fraud-verifying smart-contract and (4) a novel timelock-based method for proving data availability to Bitcoin smart contracts. The enhanced BitVMX protocol enables the verification of uncompressed inputs such as SPV proofs, NiPoPoWs, or longer computation integrity proofs, such as STARKs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Denotational Semantics for Probabilistic and Concurrent Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02768v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a denotational model for programs that have standard programming constructs such as conditionals and while-loops, as well as probabilistic and concurrent commands. Whereas semantic models for languages with either concurrency or randomization are well studied, their combination is limited to languages with bounded loops. Our work is the first to consider both randomization and concurrency for a language with unbounded looping constructs. The interaction between Boolean tests (arising from the control flow structures), probabilistic actions, and concurrent execution creates challenges in generalizing previous work on pomsets and convex languages, prominent models for those effects, individually. To illustrate the generality of our model, we show that it recovers a typical powerdomain semantics for concurrency, as well as the convex powerset semantics for probabilistic nondeterminism.</p></details> |  |

Exploring and Evaluating the Design and Trade-offs of Proactive AI Programming Support](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18658v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI programming tools enable powerful code generation, and recent prototypes attempt to reduce user effort with proactive AI agents, but their impact on programming workflows remains unexplored. We introduce and evaluate Codellaborator, a design probe LLM agent that initiates programming assistance based on editor activities and task context. We explored three interface variants to assess trade-offs between increasingly salient AI support: prompt-only, proactive agent, and proactive agent with presence and context (Codellaborator). In a within-subject study (N=18), we find that proactive agents increase efficiency compared to prompt-only paradigm, but also incur workflow disruptions. However, presence indicators and interaction context support alleviated disruptions and improved users' awareness of AI processes. We underscore trade-offs of Codellaborator on user control, ownership, and code understanding, emphasizing the need to adapt proactivity to programming processes. Our research contributes to the design exploration and evaluation of proactive AI systems, presenting design implications on AI-integrated programming workflow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Various Software Artifacts for Better LLM-based Bug Localization and Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03905v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. The source code and experimental results of this work for replication are available at https://github.com/XYZboom/DEVLoRe.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 11 images, 9 tables, Manuscript submitted to a journal (2024)</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Robot Programming: Mixed Reality Gripper Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02042v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional robot programming methods are complex and time-consuming for users. In recent years, alternative approaches such as mixed reality have been explored to address these challenges and optimize robot programming. While the findings of the mixed reality robot programming methods are convincing, most existing methods rely on gesture interaction for robot programming. Since controller-based interactions have proven to be more reliable, this paper examines three controller-based programming methods within a mixed reality scenario: 1) Classical Jogging, where the user positions the robot's end effector using the controller's thumbsticks, 2) Direct Control, where the controller's position and orientation directly corresponds to the end effector's, and 3) Gripper Control, where the controller is enhanced with a 3D-printed gripper attachment to grasp and release objects. A within-subjects study (n = 30) was conducted to compare these methods. The findings indicate that the Gripper Control condition outperforms the others in terms of task completion time, user experience, mental demand, and task performance, while also being the preferred method. Therefore, it demonstrates promising potential as an effective and efficient approach for future robot programming.

| **[Mapping Spiking Neural Networks to Heterogeneous Crossbar Architectures using Integer Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02033v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Advances in novel hardware devices and architectures allow Spiking Neural Network evaluation using ultra-low power, mixed-signal, memristor crossbar arrays. As individual network sizes quickly scale beyond the dimensional capabilities of single crossbars, networks must be mapped onto multiple crossbars. Crossbar sizes within modern Memristor Crossbar Architectures are determined predominately not by device technology but by network topology; more, smaller crossbars consume less area thanks to the high structural sparsity found in larger, brain-inspired SNNs. Motivated by continuing increases in SNN sparsity due to improvements in training methods, we propose utilizing heterogeneous crossbar sizes to further reduce area consumption. This approach was previously unachievable as prior compiler studies only explored solutions targeting homogeneous MCAs. Our work improves on the state-of-the-art by providing Integer Linear Programming formulations supporting arbitrarily heterogeneous architectures. By modeling axonal interactions between neurons our methods produce better mappings while removing inhibitive a priori knowledge requirements. We first show a 16.7-27.6% reduction in area consumption for square-crossbar homogeneous architectures. Then, we demonstrate 66.9-72.7% further reduction when using a reasonable configuration of heterogeneous crossbar dimensions. Next, we present a new optimization formulation capable of minimizing the number of inter-crossbar routes. When applied to solutions already near-optimal in area an 11.9-26.4% routing reduction is observed without impacting area consumption. Finally, we present a profile-guided optimization capable of minimizing the number of runtime spikes between crossbars. Compared to the best-area-then-route optimized solutions we observe a further 0.5-14.8% inter-crossbar spike reduction while requiring 1-3 orders of magnitude less solver time.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in DATE'25</p></details> |
| **[Predicting post-release defects with knowledge units (KUs) of programming languages: an empirical study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02907v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Defect prediction plays a crucial role in software engineering, enabling developers to identify defect-prone code and improve software quality. While extensive research has focused on refining machine learning models for defect prediction, the exploration of new data sources for feature engineering remains limited. Defect prediction models primarily rely on traditional metrics such as product, process, and code ownership metrics, which, while effective, do not capture language-specific traits that may influence defect proneness. To address this gap, we introduce Knowledge Units (KUs) of programming languages as a novel feature set for analyzing software systems and defect prediction. A KU is a cohesive set of key capabilities that are offered by one or more building blocks of a given programming language. We conduct an empirical study leveraging 28 KUs that are derived from Java certification exams and compare their effectiveness against traditional metrics in predicting post-release defects across 8 well-maintained Java software systems. Our results show that KUs provide significant predictive power, achieving a median AUC of 0.82, outperforming individual group of traditional metric-based models. Among KU features, Method & Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Exception Handling emerge as the most influential predictors. Furthermore, combining KUs with traditional metrics enhances prediction performance, yielding a median AUC of 0.89. We also introduce a cost-effective model using only 10 features, which maintains strong predictive performance while reducing feature engineering costs. Our findings demonstrate the value of KUs in predicting post-release defects, offering a complementary perspective to traditional metrics. This study can be helpful to researchers who wish to analyze software systems from a perspective that is complementary to that of traditional metrics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Apollo-MILP: An Alternating Prediction-Correction Neural Solving Framework for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01129v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging machine learning (ML) to predict an initial solution for mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) has gained considerable popularity in recent years. These methods predict a solution and fix a subset of variables to reduce the problem dimension. Then, they solve the reduced problem to obtain the final solutions. However, directly fixing variable values can lead to low-quality solutions or even infeasible reduced problems if the predicted solution is not accurate enough. To address this challenge, we propose an Alternating prediction-correction neural solving framework (Apollo-MILP) that can identify and select accurate and reliable predicted values to fix. In each iteration, Apollo-MILP conducts a prediction step for the unfixed variables, followed by a correction step to obtain an improved solution (called reference solution) through a trust-region search. By incorporating the predicted and reference solutions, we introduce a novel Uncertainty-based Error upper BOund (UEBO) to evaluate the uncertainty of the predicted values and fix those with high confidence. A notable feature of Apollo-MILP is the superior ability for problem reduction while preserving optimality, leading to high-quality final solutions. Experiments on commonly used benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed Apollo-MILP significantly outperforms other ML-based approaches in terms of solution quality, achieving over a 50% reduction in the solution gap.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scalable Memory Recycling for Large Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00822v1)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As quantum computing technology advances, the complexity of quantum algorithms increases, necessitating a shift from low-level circuit descriptions to high-level programming paradigms. This paper addresses the challenges of developing a compilation algorithm that optimizes memory management and scales well for bigger, more complex circuits. Our approach models the high-level quantum code as a control flow graph and presents a workflow that searches for a topological sort that maximizes opportunities for qubit reuse. Various heuristics for qubit reuse strategies handle the trade-off between circuit width and depth. We also explore scalability issues in large circuits, suggesting methods to mitigate compilation bottlenecks. By analyzing the structure of the circuit, we are able to identify sub-problems that can be solved separately, without a significant effect on circuit quality, while reducing runtime significantly. This method lays the groundwork for future advancements in quantum programming and compiler optimization by incorporating scalability into quantum memory management.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a new Mixed-Integer Conic Program (MICP) formulation for the Multi-Agent Moving-Target Traveling Salesman Problem (MA-MT-TSP), a generalization of the MT-TSP involving multiple agents. Our approach begins by restating the current state-of-the-art MICP formulation for MA-MT-TSP as a Nonconvex Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP), followed by a novel reformulation into a new MICP. We present computational results demonstrating that our formulation outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving up to two orders of magnitude reduction in runtime, and over 90% improvement in optimality gap.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

However, code LLMs cannot synthesize specialized programs when tasked with IoT applications that require domain knowledge. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a promising solution by fetching relevant domain knowledge, it necessitates powerful cloud LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) to process user requirements and retrieved contents, which raises significant privacy concerns. This approach also suffers from unstable networks and prohibitive LLM query costs. Moreover, it is challenging to ensure the correctness and relevance of the fetched contents. To address these issues, we propose GPIoT, a code generation system for IoT applications by fine-tuning locally deployable Small Language Models (SLMs) on IoT-specialized datasets. SLMs have smaller model sizes, allowing efficient local deployment and execution to mitigate privacy concerns and network uncertainty. Furthermore, by fine-tuning the SLMs with our IoT-specialized datasets, the SLMs' ability to synthesize IoT-related programs can be substantially improved. To evaluate GPIoT's capability in synthesizing programs for IoT applications, we develop a benchmark, IoTBench. Extensive experiments and user trials demonstrate the effectiveness of GPIoT in generating IoT-specialized code, outperforming state-of-the-art code LLMs with an average task accuracy increment of 64.7% and significant improvements in user satisfaction.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, developers still need to manually inspect each patch to confirm its correctness, which is tedious and time-consuming. This challenge is exacerbated in the presence of plausible patches, which accidentally pass test cases but may not correctly fix the bug. To address this challenge, we propose an interactive approach called iFix to facilitate patch understanding and comparison based on their runtime difference. iFix performs static analysis to identify runtime variables related to the buggy statement and captures their runtime values during execution for each patch. These values are then aligned across different patch candidates, allowing users to compare and contrast their runtime behavior. To evaluate iFix, we conducted a within-subjects user study with 28 participants. Compared with manual inspection and a state-of-the-art interactive patch filtering technique, iFix reduced participants' task completion time by 36% and 33% while also improving their confidence by 50% and 20%, respectively. Besides, quantitative experiments demonstrate that iFix improves the ranking of correct patches by at least 39% compared with other patch ranking methods and is generalizable to different APR tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 8 figures, OOPSLA 2025</p></details> |

To assist humans in repairing them, we propose to automatically decompose complex solutions into multiple simpler pieces that correspond to specific subtasks. We introduce a novel objective for learning task decomposition, termed assistive value (AssistV), which measures the feasibility and speed for humans to repair the decomposed solution. We collect a dataset of human repair experiences on different decomposed solutions. Utilizing the collected data as in-context examples, we then learn to critique, refine, and rank decomposed solutions to improve AssistV. We validate our method under competitive programming problems: under 177 hours of human study, our method enables non-experts to solve 33.3\% more problems, speeds them up by 3.3x, and empowers them to match unassisted experts.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2024 Main Conference</p></details> |

Unlike traditional approaches for program realization that assume full agent control or rely on incremental search, we address scenarios where environmental nondeterminism significantly influences program outcomes. Our synthesis problem involves deriving a policy that successfully realizes a given Golog program while ensuring the satisfaction of a temporal specification, expressed in Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf), across all possible environmental behaviors. By leveraging an expressive class of first-order action theories, we construct a finite game arena that encapsulates program executions and tracks the satisfaction of the temporal goal. A game-theoretic approach is employed to derive such a policy. Experimental results demonstrate this approach's feasibility in domains with unbounded objects and non-local effects. This work bridges agent programming and temporal logic synthesis, providing a framework for robust agent behavior in nondeterministic environments.</p></details> | AAAI'25 |

However, existing research often focuses on individual tools rather than deriving broader design recommendations. A key challenge in designing these systems is balancing learner control with system-driven guidance. To explore user preferences for AI-supported programming learning tools, we conducted a participatory design study with 15 undergraduate novice programmers and 10 instructors to gather insights on their desired help features and control preferences, as well as a follow-up survey with 172 introductory programming students. Our qualitative findings show that learners prefer help that is encouraging, incorporates visual aids, and includes peer-related insights, whereas instructors prioritize scaffolding that reflects learners' progress and reinforces best practices. Both groups favor shared control, though learners generally prefer more autonomy, while instructors lean toward greater system guidance to prevent cognitive overload. Additionally, our interviews revealed individual differences in control preferences. Based on our findings, we propose design guidelines for AI-supported programming tools, particularly regarding user-centered help features and adaptive control mechanisms. Our work contributes to the human-centered design of AI-supported learning environments by informing the development of systems that effectively balance autonomy and guidance, enhancing AI-supported educational tools for programming and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Consistent Are Humans When Grading Programming Assignments?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12967v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Providing consistent summative assessment to students is important, as the grades they are awarded affect their progression through university and future career prospects. While small cohorts are typically assessed by a single assessor, such as the class leader, larger cohorts are often assessed by multiple assessors, which increases the risk of inconsistent grading. To investigate the consistency of human grading of programming assignments, we asked 28 participants to each grade 40 CS1 introductory Java assignments, providing grades and feedback for correctness, code elegance, readability and documentation; the 40 assignments were split into two batches of 20. In the second batch of 20, we duplicated one assignment from the first to analyse the internal consistency of individual assessors. We measured the inter-rater reliability of the groups using Krippendorf's $\alpha$ -- an $\alpha > 0.667$ is recommended to make tentative conclusions based on the rating. Our groups were inconsistent, with an average $\alpha = 0.2$ when grading correctness and an average $\alpha < 0.1$ for code elegance, readability and documentation. To measure the individual consistency of graders, we measured the distance between the grades they awarded for the duplicated assignment in batch one and batch two. Only one participant of the 22 who didn't notice that the assignment was a duplicate was awarded the same grade for correctness, code elegance, readability and documentation. The average grade difference was 1.79 for correctness and less than 1.6 for code elegance, readability and documentation. Our results show that human graders in our study can not agree on the grade to give a piece of student work and are often individually inconsistent, suggesting that the idea of a ``gold standard'' of human grading might be flawed, and highlights that a shared rubric alone is not enough to ensure consistency.</p></details> |  |

This work explores the design and implementation of proactive AI assistants powered by large language models. We first outline the key design considerations for building effective proactive assistants. As a case study, we propose a proactive chat-based programming assistant that automatically provides suggestions and facilitates their integration into the programmer's code. The programming context provides a shared workspace enabling the assistant to offer more relevant suggestions. We conducted a randomized experimental study examining the impact of various design elements of the proactive assistant on programmer productivity and user experience. Our findings reveal significant benefits of incorporating proactive chat assistants into coding environments and uncover important nuances that influence their usage and effectiveness.</p></details> | CHI 2025 |

In addition, we develop a simulator that simulates a quantum computer in the network and receives the jobs offloaded by the runtime. Four detailed examples show how our programming model can be used to write hybrid quantum-classical software.

| **[ProBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models in Competitive Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20868v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o3 and DeepSeek-R1 emerging, large language models (LLMs) have entered a new phase of development. However, existing benchmarks for coding evaluation are gradually inadequate to assess the capability of advanced LLMs in code reasoning. To bridge the gap for high-level code reasoning assessment, we propose ProBench to benchmark LLMs in competitive programming, drawing inspiration from the International Collegiate Programming Contest. ProBench collects a comprehensive set of competitive programming problems from Codeforces, Luogu, and Nowcoder platforms during the period from July to December 2024, obtaining real test results through online submissions to ensure the fairness and accuracy of the evaluation. We establish a unified problem attribute system, including difficulty grading and algorithm tagging. With carefully collected and annotated data in ProBench, we systematically assess 9 latest LLMs in competitive programming across multiple dimensions, including thought chain analysis, error type diagnosis, and reasoning depth evaluation. Experimental results show that QwQ-32B-Preview achieves the best score of 20.93 followed by DeepSeek-V3 with a score of 16.38, suggesting that models trained with specialized reasoning tasks significantly outperform general-purpose models (even larger than reasoning-oriented models) in programming. Further analysis also reveals key areas for programming capability enhancement, e.g., algorithm adaptability and reasoning sufficiency, providing important insights for the future development of reasoning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing the Design Space: Parallel Versions for Exploratory Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20535v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploratory programming involves open-ended tasks. To evaluate their progress on these, programmers require frequent feedback and means to tell if the feedback they observe is bringing them in the right direction. Collecting, comparing, and sharing feedback is typically done through ad-hoc means: relying on memory to compare outputs, code comments, or manual screenshots. To approach this issue, we designed Exploriants: an extension to example-based live programming. Exploriants allows programmers to place variation points. It collects outputs captured in probes and presents them in a comparison view that programmers can customize to suit their program domain. We find that the addition of variation points and the comparisons view encourages a structured approach to exploring variations of a program. We demonstrate Exploriants' capabilities and applicability in three case studies on image processing, data processing, and game development. Given Exploriants, exploratory programmers are given a straightforward means to evaluate their progress and do not have to rely on ad-hoc methods that may introduce errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistent Distributed Reactive Programming with Retroactive Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20534v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Many systems require receiving data from multiple information sources, which act as distributed network devices that asynchronously send the latest data at their own pace to generalize various kinds of devices and connections, known as the Internet of Things (IoT). These systems often perform computations both **reactively** and **retroactively** on information received from the sources for monitoring and analytical purposes, respectively. Inquiry: It is challenging to design a programming language that can describe such systems at a high level of abstraction for two reasons: (1) reactive and retroactive computations in these systems are performed alongside the execution of other application logic; and (2) information sources may be distributed, and data from these sources may arrive late or be lost entirely. Addressing these difficulties is our fundamental problem. Approach: We propose a programming language that supports the following features. First, our language incorporates reactive time-varying values (also known as signals) embedded within an imperative language. Second, it supports multiple information sources that are distributed and represented as signals, meaning they can be declaratively composed to form other time-varying values. Finally, it allows computation over past values collected from information sources and recovery from inconsistency caused by packet loss. To address the aforementioned difficulties, we develop a core calculus for this proposed language. Knowledge: This calculus is a hybrid of reactive/retroactive computations and imperative ones. Because of this hybrid nature, the calculus is inherently complex; however, we have simplified it as much as possible. First, its semantics are modeled as a simple, single-threaded abstraction based on typeless object calculus. Meanwhile, reactive computations that execute in parallel are modeled using a simple process calculus and are integrated with the object calculus, ensuring that the computation results are always serialized. Specifically, we show that time consistency is guaranteed in the calculus; in other words, consistency can be recovered at any checkpoint. Grounding: This work is supported by formally stating and proving theorems regarding time consistency. We also conducted a microbenchmarking experiment to demonstrate that the implemented recovery process is feasible in our assumed application scenarios. Importance: The ensured time consistency provides a rigorous foundation for performing analytics on computation results obtained from distributed information sources, even when these sources experience delays or packet loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Program Slices Change How Developers Diagnose Gradual Run-Time Type Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20533v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A gradual type system allows developers to declare certain types to be enforced by the compiler (i.e., statically typed), while leaving other types to be enforced via runtime checks (i.e., dynamically typed). When runtime checks fail, debugging gradually typed programs becomes cumbersome, because these failures may arise far from the original point where an inconsistent type assumption is made. To ease this burden on developers, some gradually typed languages produce a blame report for a given type inconsistency. However, these reports are sometimes misleading, because they might point to program points that do not need to be changed to stop the error. To overcome the limitations of blame reports, we propose using dynamic program slicing as an alternative approach to help programmers debug run-time type errors. We describe a proof-of-concept for TypeSlicer, a tool that would present dynamic program slices to developers when a runtime check fails. We performed a Wizard-of-Oz user study to investigate how developers respond to dynamic program slices through a set of simulated interactions with TypeScript programs. This formative study shows that developers can understand and apply dynamic slice information to provide change recommendations when debugging runtime type errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Supervised Fine-Tuning LLMs to Behave as Pedagogical Agents in Programming Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20527v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored in higher education, yet their effectiveness as teaching agents remains underexamined. In this paper, we present the development of GuideLM, a fine-tuned LLM designed for programming education. GuideLM has been integrated into the Debugging C Compiler (DCC), an educational C compiler that leverages LLMs to generate pedagogically sound error explanations. Previously, DCC relied on off-the-shelf OpenAI models, which, while accurate, often over-assisted students by directly providing solutions despite contrary prompting. To address this, we employed supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a dataset of 528 student-question/teacher-answer pairs, creating two models: GuideLM and GuideLM-mini, fine-tuned on ChatGPT-4o and 4o-mini, respectively. We conducted an expert analysis of 400 responses per model, comparing their pedagogical effectiveness against base OpenAI models. Our evaluation, grounded in constructivism and cognitive load theory, assessed factors such as conceptual scaffolding, clarity, and Socratic guidance. Results indicate that GuideLM and GuideLM-mini improve pedagogical performance, with an 8% increase in Socratic guidance and a 58% improvement in economy of words compared to GPT-4o. However, this refinement comes at the cost of a slight reduction in general accuracy. While further work is needed, our findings suggest that fine-tuning LLMs with targeted datasets is a promising approach for developing models better suited to educational contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two Approaches for Programming Education in the Domain of Graphics: An Experiment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20526v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Graphics is a popular domain for teaching introductory programming in a motivating way, even in text-based programming languages. Over the last few decades, a large number of libraries using different approaches have been developed for this purpose. Inquiry: Prior work in introductory programming that uses graphics as input and output has shown positive results in terms of engagement, but research is scarce on whether learners are able to use programming concepts learned through graphics for programming in other domains, transferring what they have learned. Approach: We conducted a randomized, controlled experiment with 145 students as participants divided into two groups. Both groups programmed using graphics in Python, but used different approaches: one group used a compositional graphics library named PyTamaro; the other used the Turtle graphics library from Python's standard library. Student engagement was assessed with surveys, and programming knowledge with a post-test on general programming concepts and programming tasks in the domain of graphics. Knowledge: We find few differences between the two groups on the post-test, despite the PyTamaro group having practiced on problems isomorphic to those in the post-test. The participants traced a compositional graphics program more accurately than a 'comparable' turtle graphics program. Both groups report high engagement and perceived learning; both perform well on simple program-writing tasks to create graphics. Grounding: Our findings are based on a controlled experiment with a count of 145 participants, which exceeds the sample size indicated by power analysis to detect a medium effect size. The complete instrument and teaching materials used in the study are available as appendixes. Importance: This study adds further evidence that graphics is an engaging domain for introductory programming; moreover, it shows that the compositional graphics approach adopted by PyTamaro yields engagement levels comparable to the venerable turtle approach. Compositional graphics code appears to be easier to trace than turtle graphics code. As for conceptual knowledge, our results indicate that practicing on programming tasks isomorphic to those of the test can still not be enough to achieve better transfer. This challenges programming educators and researchers to investigate further which graphics-based approaches work best and how to facilitate transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Programming Really Is Simple Mathematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17149v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A re-construction of the fundamentals of programming as a small mathematical theory (PRISM) based on elementary set theory. Highlights: $\bullet$ Zero axioms. No properties are assumed, all are proved (from standard set theory). $\bullet$ A single concept covers specifications and programs. $\bullet$ Its definition only involves one relation and one set. $\bullet$ Everything proceeds from three operations: choice, composition and restriction. $\bullet$ These techniques suffice to derive the axioms of classic papers on the "laws of programming" as consequences and prove them mechanically. $\bullet$ The ordinary subset operator suffices to define both the notion of program correctness and the concepts of specialization and refinement. $\bullet$ From this basis, the theory deduces dozens of theorems characterizing important properties of programs and programming. $\bullet$ All these theorems have been mechanically verified (using Isabelle/HOL); the proofs are available in a public repository. This paper is a considerable extension and rewrite of an earlier contribution [arXiv:1507.00723]</p></details> |  |

We introduce LangProBe, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating the architectures and optimization strategies for language programs, with over 2000 combinations of tasks, architectures, optimizers, and choices of LMs. Using LangProBe, we are the first to study the impact of program architectures and optimizers (and their compositions together and with different models) on tradeoffs of quality and cost. We find that optimized language programs offer strong cost--quality Pareto improvement over raw calls to models, but simultaneously demonstrate that human judgment (or empirical decisions) about which compositions to pursue is still necessary for best performance. We will open source the code and evaluation data for LangProBe.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bugfix: a standard language, database schema and repository for research on bugs and automatic program repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15599v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Program Repair (APR) is a brilliant idea: when detecting a bug, also provide suggestions for correcting the program. Progress towards that goal is hindered by the absence of a common frame of reference for the multiplicity of APR ideas, methods, tools, programming languages and environments. Bugfix is an effort at providing such a framework: a standardized set of notations, tools and interfaces, as well as a database of bugs and fixes, for use by the APR research community to try out ideas and compare results. The most directly visible component of the Bugfix effort is the Bugfix language, a human-readable formalism making it possible to describe elements of the following kinds: a bug (described abstractly, for example the permutation of two arguments in a call); a bug example (an actual occurrence of a bug, in a specific code written in a specific programming language, and usually recorded in some repository); a fix (a particular correction of a bug, obtained for example by reversing the misplaced arguments); an application (an entity that demonstrates how a actual code example matches with a fix); a construct (the abstract description of a programming mechanism, for example a ``while'' loop, independently of its realization in a programming language; and a language (a description of how a particular programming language includes certain constructs and provides specific concrete syntax for each of them -- for example Java includes loop, assignment etc. and has a defined format for each of them). A JSON API provides it in a form accessible to tools. Bugfix includes a repository containing a considerable amount of bugs, examples and fixes. Note: An early step towards this article was a short contribution (Ref [1]) to the 2024 ICSE. The present text reuses a few elements of introduction and motivation but is otherwise thoroughly reworked and extended.</p></details> |  |
| **[Program Synthesis Dialog Agents for Interactive Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19610v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world eligibility problems, ranging from medical diagnosis to tax planning, can be mapped to decision problems expressed in natural language, wherein a model must make a binary choice based on user features. Large-scale domains such as legal codes or frequently updated funding opportunities render human annotation (e.g., web forms or decision trees) impractical, highlighting the need for agents that can automatically assist in decision-making. Since relevant information is often only known to the user, it is crucial that these agents ask the right questions. As agents determine when to terminate a conversation, they face a trade-off between accuracy and the number of questions asked, a key metric for both user experience and cost. To evaluate this task, we propose BeNYfits, a new benchmark for determining user eligibility for multiple overlapping social benefits opportunities through interactive decision-making. Our experiments show that current language models struggle with frequent hallucinations, with GPT-4o scoring only 35.7 F1 using a ReAct-style chain-of-thought. To address this, we introduce ProADA, a novel approach that leverages program synthesis to assist in decision-making by mapping dialog planning to a code generation problem and using gaps in structured data to determine the best next action. Our agent, ProADA, improves the F1 score to 55.6 while maintaining nearly the same number of dialog turns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Language Probabilistic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19538v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are many different probabilistic programming languages that are specialized to specific kinds of probabilistic programs. From a usability and scalability perspective, this is undesirable: today, probabilistic programmers are forced up-front to decide which language they want to use and cannot mix-and-match different languages for handling heterogeneous programs. To rectify this, we seek a foundation for sound interoperability for probabilistic programming languages: just as today's Python programmers can resort to low-level C programming for performance, we argue that probabilistic programmers should be able to freely mix different languages for meeting the demands of heterogeneous probabilistic programming environments. As a first step towards this goal, we introduce \textsc{MultiPPL}, a probabilistic multi-language that enables programmers to interoperate between two different probabilistic programming languages: one that leverages a high-performance exact discrete inference strategy, and one that uses approximate importance sampling. We give a syntax and semantics for \textsc{MultiPPL}, prove soundness of its inference algorithm, and provide empirical evidence that it enables programmers to perform inference on complex heterogeneous probabilistic programs and flexibly exploits the strengths and weaknesses of two languages simultaneously.%</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at OOPSLA 2025 (R1)</p></details> |

To provide correctness guarantees for the client, we propose adapting the cryptographic notion of refereed delegation to the machine learning setting. This approach enables a computationally limited client to delegate a program to multiple untrusted compute providers, with a guarantee of obtaining the correct result if at least one of them is honest. Refereed delegation of ML programs poses two technical hurdles: (1) an arbitration protocol to resolve disputes when compute providers disagree on the output, and (2) the ability to bitwise reproduce ML programs across different hardware setups, For (1), we design Verde, a dispute arbitration protocol that efficiently handles the large scale and graph-based computational model of modern ML programs. For (2), we build RepOps (Reproducible Operators), a library that eliminates hardware "non-determinism" by controlling the order of floating point operations performed on all hardware. Our implementation shows that refereed delegation achieves both strong guarantees for clients and practical overheads for compute providers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundations for Deductive Verification of Continuous Probabilistic Programs: From Lebesgue to Riemann and Back](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19388v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We lay out novel foundations for the computer-aided verification of guaranteed bounds on expected outcomes of imperative probabilistic programs featuring (i) general loops, (ii) continuous distributions, and (iii) conditioning. To handle loops we rely on user-provided quantitative invariants, as is well established. However, in the realm of continuous distributions, invariant verification becomes extremely challenging due to the presence of integrals in expectation-based program semantics. Our key idea is to soundly under- or over-approximate these integrals via Riemann sums. We show that this approach enables the SMT-based invariant verification for programs with a fairly general control flow structure. On the theoretical side, we prove convergence of our Riemann approximations, and establish coRE-completeness of the central verification problems. On the practical side, we show that our approach enables to use existing automated verifiers targeting discrete probabilistic programs for the verification of programs involving continuous sampling. Towards this end, we implement our approach in the recent quantitative verification infrastructure Caesar by encoding Riemann sums in its intermediate verification language. We present several promising case studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of OOPSLA 25 paper, 55 pages</p></details> |

To achieve increasingly more responsive behaviors upon interactions without relying on centralized computation, embodying memory directly in the machines' structure is crucial. Here, we harness the bistability of elastic shells to alter the fluidic properties of an enclosed cavity, thereby switching between stable frequency states of a locomoting self-oscillating machine. To program these memory states upon interactions, we develop fluidic circuits surrounding the bistable shell, with soft tubes that kink and unkink when externally touched. We implement circuits for both long-term and short-term memory in a soft machine that switches behaviors in response to a human user and that autonomously changes direction after detecting a wall. By harnessing only geometry and elasticity, embodying memory allows physical structures without a central brain to exhibit autonomous feats that are typically reserved for computer-based robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[DBox: Scaffolding Algorithmic Programming Learning through Learner-LLM Co-Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19133v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decomposition is a fundamental skill in algorithmic programming, requiring learners to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. However, current self-study methods, such as browsing reference solutions or using LLM assistants, often provide excessive or generic assistance that misaligns with learners' decomposition strategies, hindering independent problem-solving and critical thinking. To address this, we introduce Decomposition Box (DBox), an interactive LLM-based system that scaffolds and adapts to learners' personalized construction of a step tree through a "learner-LLM co-decomposition" approach, providing tailored support at an appropriate level. A within-subjects study (N=24) found that compared to the baseline, DBox significantly improved learning gains, cognitive engagement, and critical thinking. Learners also reported a stronger sense of achievement and found the assistance appropriate and helpful for learning. Additionally, we examined DBox's impact on cognitive load, identified usage patterns, and analyzed learners' strategies for managing system errors. We conclude with design implications for future AI-powered tools to better support algorithmic programming education.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Better Understanding of Program-of-Thought Reasoning in Cross-Lingual and Multilingual Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17956v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-step reasoning is essential for large language models (LLMs), yet multilingual performance remains challenging. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning, it struggles with non-English languages due to the entanglement of reasoning and execution. Program-of-Thought (PoT) prompting separates reasoning from execution, offering a promising alternative but shifting the challenge to generating programs from non-English questions. We propose a framework to evaluate PoT by separating multilingual reasoning from code execution to examine (i) the impact of fine-tuning on question-reasoning alignment and (ii) how reasoning quality affects answer correctness. Our findings demonstrate that PoT fine-tuning substantially enhances multilingual reasoning, outperforming CoT fine-tuned models. We further demonstrate a strong correlation between reasoning quality (measured through code quality) and answer accuracy, highlighting its potential as a test-time performance improvement heuristic.</p></details> |  |
| **[The AI Definition and a Program Which Satisfies this Definition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03184v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We will consider all policies of the agent and will prove that one of them is the best performing policy. While that policy is not computable, computable policies do exist in its proximity. We will define AI as a computable policy which is sufficiently proximal to the best performing policy. Before we can define the agent's best performing policy, we need a language for description of the world. We will also use this language to develop a program which satisfies the AI definition. The program will first understand the world by describing it in the selected language. The program will then use the description in order to predict the future and select the best possible move. While this program is extremely inefficient and practically unusable, it can be improved by refining both the language for description of the world and the algorithm used to predict the future. This can yield a program which is both efficient and consistent with the AI definition.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpecGen: Automated Generation of Formal Program Specifications via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08807v5)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal program specifications play a crucial role in various stages of software development. However, manually crafting formal program specifications is rather difficult, making the job time-consuming and labor-intensive. It is even more challenging to write specifications that correctly and comprehensively describe the semantics of complex programs. To reduce the burden on software developers, automated specification generation methods have emerged. However, existing methods usually rely on predefined templates or grammar, making them struggle to accurately describe the behavior and functionality of complex real-world programs. To tackle this challenge, we introduce SpecGen, a novel technique for formal program specification generation based on Large Language Models. Our key insight is to overcome the limitations of existing methods by leveraging the code comprehension capability of LLMs. The process of SpecGen consists of two phases. The first phase employs a conversational approach that guides the LLM to generate appropriate specifications for a given program. The second phase, designed for where the LLM fails to generate correct specifications, applies four mutation operators to the model-generated specifications and selects verifiable specifications from the mutated ones through a novel heuristic selection strategy. We evaluate SpecGen on two datasets, including the SV-COMP Java category benchmark and a manually constructed dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that SpecGen succeeds in generating verifiable specifications for 279 out of 385 programs, outperforming the existing purely LLM-based approaches and conventional specification generation tools like Houdini and Daikon. Further investigations on the quality of generated specifications indicate that SpecGen can comprehensively articulate the behaviors of the input program.</p></details> |  |

Collaborative programming emerges as an effective method for instructors to support novice students in developing coding and teamwork abilities. However, due to limited class time and attention, instructors face challenges in monitoring and evaluating the progress and performance of groups or individuals. To address this issue, we collect multimodal data from real-world settings and develop CPVis, an interactive visual analytics system designed to assess student collaboration dynamically. Specifically, CPVis enables instructors to evaluate both group and individual performance efficiently. CPVis employs a novel flower-based visual encoding to represent performance and provides time-based views to capture the evolution of collaborative behaviors. A within-subject experiment (N=22), comparing CPVis with two baseline systems, reveals that users gain more insights, find the visualization more intuitive, and report increased confidence in their assessments of collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Programming with Pixels: Computer-Use Meets Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18525v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in software engineering (SWE) agents have largely followed a $\textit{tool-based paradigm}$, where agents interact with hand-engineered tool APIs to perform specific tasks. While effective for specialized tasks, these methods fundamentally lack generalization, as they require predefined tools for each task and do not scale across programming languages and domains. We introduce $\texttt{Programming with Pixels}$ (PwP), an agent environment that unifies software development tasks by enabling $\textit{computer-use agents}$-agents that operate directly within an IDE through visual perception, typing, and clicking, rather than relying on predefined tool APIs. To systematically evaluate these agents, we propose $\texttt{PwP-Bench}$, a benchmark that unifies existing SWE benchmarks spanning tasks across multiple programming languages, modalities, and domains under a task-agnostic state and action space. Our experiments demonstrate that general-purpose computer-use agents can approach or even surpass specialized tool-based agents on a variety of SWE tasks without the need for hand-engineered tools. However, our analysis shows that current models suffer from limited visual grounding and fail to exploit many IDE tools that could simplify their tasks. When agents can directly access IDE tools, without visual interaction, they show significant performance improvements, highlighting the untapped potential of leveraging built-in IDE capabilities. Our results establish PwP as a scalable testbed for building and evaluating the next wave of software engineering agents.

As large language models that can generate code have become widely available, scientists may increasingly use these models during research software development. We investigate the characteristics of scientists who are early-adopters of code generating models and conduct interviews with scientists at a public, research-focused university. Through interviews and reviews of user interaction logs, we see that scientists often use code generating models as an information retrieval tool for navigating unfamiliar programming languages and libraries. We present findings about their verification strategies and discuss potential vulnerabilities that may emerge from code generation practices unknowingly influencing the parameters of scientific analyses.</p></details> | Accepted to CHI 2025 |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning With Preference Optimization For Visual Program Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16529v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual programming languages (VPLs) allow users to create programs through graphical interfaces, which results in easier accessibility and their widespread usage in various domains. To further enhance this accessibility, recent research has focused on generating VPL code from user instructions using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, by employing prompting-based methods, these studies have shown promising results. Nevertheless, such approaches can be less effective for industrial VPLs such as Ladder Diagram (LD). LD is a pivotal language used in industrial automation processes and involves extensive domain-specific configurations, which are difficult to capture in a single prompt. In this work, we demonstrate that training-based methods outperform prompting-based methods for LD generation accuracy, even with smaller backbone models. Building on these findings, we propose a two-stage training strategy to further enhance VPL generation. First, we employ retrieval-augmented fine-tuning to leverage the repetitive use of subroutines commonly seen in industrial VPLs. Second, we apply direct preference optimization (DPO) to further guide the model toward accurate outputs, using systematically generated preference pairs through graph editing operations. Extensive experiments on real-world LD data demonstrate that our approach improves program-level accuracy by over 10% compared to supervised fine-tuning, which highlights its potential to advance industrial automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor Network Structure Search Using Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02711v2)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor networks provide a powerful framework for compressing multi-dimensional data. The optimal tensor network structure for a given data tensor depends on both the inherent data properties and the specific optimality criteria, making tensor network structure search a crucial research problem. Existing solutions typically involve sampling and validating numerous candidate structures; this is computationally expensive, limiting their practical applications. We address this challenge by formulating tensor network structure search as a program synthesis problem and proposing a highly efficient validation method that is based on constraint solving. Specifically, we design a domain specific language: it builds the correspondence between programs and network structures, and uses a novel idea of output-directed splits to compress the search space without hindering the expressiveness. We then propose a synthesis algorithm that can prioritize promising candidates through constraint solving. % Experimental results show that our approach improves search speed by $10\times$ and achieves compression ratios by $1.5\times$ to $3\times$ better than state-of-the-art. Notably, our approach scales to larger tensors that are out of reach by prior work. Finally, we demonstrate that the discovered topologies generalize to data from the same source, achieving compression ratios up to $ 2.4\times$ better than hierarchical Tuckers while maintaining the runtime around $110$ seconds.</p></details> |  |

This model marks the first variable-gain ZNN to collectively manifest strictly predefined-time convergence and noise resilience, specifically tailored for kinematic motion control of robots. The SPTC-AN-FOZNN advances traditional ZNNs by incorporating a conformable fractional derivative in accordance with the Leibniz rule, a compliance not commonly achieved by other fractional derivative definitions. It also features a novel activation function designed to ensure favorable convergence independent of the model's order. When compared to five recently published recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the SPTC-AN-FOZNN, configured with $0<\alpha\leq 1$, exhibits superior positional accuracy and robustness against additive noises for TVQP applications. Extensive empirical evaluations, including simulations with two types of robotic manipulators and experiments with a Flexiv Rizon robot, have validated the SPTC-AN-FOZNN's effectiveness in precise tracking and computational efficiency, establishing its utility for robust kinematic control.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures; as accepted for publication</p></details> |
| **[A Stepwise Distillation Learning Strategy for Non-differentiable Visual Programming Frameworks on Visual Reasoning Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09809v3)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Visual Programming (VProg) has emerged as a significant framework for visual reasoning (VR) tasks due to its interpretability and cross-task generality. However, even with invoking powerful pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) as visual sub-modules, the performance of VProg on specific VR tasks is markedly inferior compared to well-trained task-specific networks. Although invoking task-specific models can further enhance the performance of VProg on specific VR tasks, it greatly diminishes the cross-task generalization ability of VProg. Besides, the non-differentiable nature of VProg prevents direct fine-tuning on specific VR tasks for further performance improvement. Attempt to address these issues, we propose SDVP, a Stepwise Distillation learning strategy for non-differentiable VPorg across various VR tasks. Specifically, our SDVP stepwise distills the capabilities of existing, well-trained small task-specific models for decomposed visual sub-tasks in VProg into the much larger VLMs invoked by corresponding visual sub-modules. Besides, distilling the knowledge of little-size task-specific models into pre-trained larger VLMs rather than replacing them helps keep the cross-task abilities of VProgs. Extensive and comprehensive experimental results on different VProg frameworks demonstrate that our SDVP obtains significant performance gains on specific VR benchmarks, i.e., GQA (+2.4\%) and NLVRv2 (+6.2\%) for VisProg and GQA (+6.5\%) and NLVRv2 (+4.0\%) for ViperGPT, and also maintains a promising performance for VProg on unseen and previous VR tasks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Foundation Models for Mixed Integer Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08288v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is essential for modeling complex decision-making problems but faces challenges in computational tractability and requires expert formulation. Current deep learning approaches for MILP focus on specific problem classes and do not generalize to unseen classes. To address this shortcoming, we take a foundation model training approach, where we train a single deep learning model on a diverse set of MILP problems to generalize across problem classes. As existing datasets for MILP lack diversity and volume, we introduce MILP-Evolve, a novel LLM-based evolutionary framework that is capable of generating a large set of diverse MILP classes with an unlimited amount of instances. We study our methodology on three key learning tasks that capture diverse aspects of MILP: (1) integrality gap prediction, (2) learning to branch, and (3) a new task of aligning MILP instances with natural language descriptions. Our empirical results show that models trained on the data generated by MILP-Evolve achieve significant improvements on unseen problems, including MIPLIB benchmarks. Our work highlights the potential of moving towards a foundation model approach for MILP that can generalize to a broad range of MILP applications. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/OptiGuide.</p></details> |  |

This progress sets the stage for Beyond 5G (B5G) networks, which present new complexity and performance requirements challenges. Linear Programming (LP), Integer Linear Programming (ILP), and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models have been widely used to model the optimization of resource allocation problems in networks. This paper reviews 103 studies on resource allocation strategies in 5G and B5G, focusing specifically on optimization problems modelled as LP, ILP, and MILP. The selected studies are categorized based on network architectures, types of resource allocation problems, and specific objective functions and constraints. The review also discusses solution methods for NP-hard ILP and MILP problems by categorizing the solution methods into different categories. Additionally, emerging trends, such as integrating AI and machine learning with optimization models, are explored, suggesting promising future research directions in network optimization.

The idea is to use a vector recording the distance to the corner of all pieces. This distance vector captures the essence of EWN. It not only outperforms many traditional EWN evaluation functions but also won first place in the TCGA 2023 competition.</p></details> |  |

While this can help understand the learning material and assist with exercises, educators are voicing more and more concerns about an overreliance on generated outputs and lack of critical thinking skills. It is thus important to understand how students actually use generative AI and what impact this could have on their learning behavior. To this end, we conducted a study including an exploratory experiment with 37 programming students, giving them monitored access to ChatGPT while solving a code authoring exercise. The task was not directly solvable by ChatGPT and required code comprehension and reasoning. While only 23 of the students actually opted to use the chatbot, the majority of those eventually prompted it to simply generate a full solution. We observed two prevalent usage strategies: to seek knowledge about general concepts and to directly generate solutions. Instead of using the bot to comprehend the code and their own mistakes, students often got trapped in a vicious cycle of submitting wrong generated code and then asking the bot for a fix. Those who self-reported using generative AI regularly were more likely to prompt the bot to generate a solution. Our findings indicate that concerns about potential decrease in programmers' agency and productivity with Generative AI are justified. We discuss how researchers and educators can respond to the potential risk of students uncritically over-relying on Generative AI. We also discuss potential modifications to our study design for large-scale replications.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint; accepted to ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE) 2025</p></details> |

However, the expert load imbalance problem always happens in MoE model pre-training, which will cause routing collapse or increased computational overhead. In order to balance loads on experts, we propose BIP-Based Balancing, an expert load balancing algorithm based on binary integer programming (BIP). The algorithm maintains an additional vector q that can help change the top-K order of s by solving a binary integer programming with very small time costs. In simulation experiments, we observe that BIP-Based Balancing make imbalance disappoint very fast, while the final sum of routine scores decreases very little. Our algorithm achieves nearly perfect trade-off between expert load balance and pre-training efficiency under the simulation view.</p></details> |  |

First, by using the duality between the dynamic programming and the semi-definite programming formulations of any q-MDP with open-loop policies, we establish that the optimal value function is linear and there exists a stationary optimal policy among open-loop policies. Then, using these results, we establish a method for computing an approximately optimal value function and formulate computation of optimal stationary open-loop policy as a bi-linear program. Next, we turn our attention to classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies. Dynamic programming and semi-definite programming formulations for classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies are established, where duality of these two formulations similarly enables us to prove that the optimal policy is linear and there exists an optimal stationary classical-state-preserving closed-loop policy. Then, similar to the open-loop case, we establish a method for computing the optimal value function and pose computation of optimal stationary classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies as a bi-linear program.</p></details> | 53 pages |
| **[Computation Tree Logic Guided Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15344v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal logics like Computation Tree Logic (CTL) have been widely used as expressive formalisms to capture rich behavioral specifications. CTL can express properties such as reachability, termination, invariants and responsiveness, which are difficult to test. This paper suggests a mechanism for the automated repair of infinite-state programs guided by CTL properties. Our produced patches avoid the overfitting issue that occurs in test-suite-guided repair, where the repaired code may not pass tests outside the given test suite. To realize this vision, we propose a repair framework based on Datalog, a widely used domain-specific language for program analysis, which readily supports nested fixed-point semantics of CTL via stratified negation. Specifically, our framework encodes the program and CTL properties into Datalog facts and rules and performs the repair by modifying the facts to pass the analysis rules. Previous research proposed a generic repair mechanism for Datalog-based analysis in the form of Symbolic Execution of Datalog (SEDL). However, SEDL only supports positive Datalog, which is insufficient for expressing CTL properties. Thus, we extended SEDL to make it applicable to stratified Datalog. Moreover, liveness property violations involve infinite computations, which we handle via a novel loop summarization. Our approach achieves analysis accuracy of 56.6% on a small-scale benchmark and 88.5% on a real-world benchmark, outperforming the best baseline performances of 27.7% and 76.9%. Our approach repairs all detected bugs, which is not achieved by existing tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe Pareto Improvements for Expected Utility Maximizers in Program Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05103v5)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents in mixed-motive coordination problems such as Chicken may fail to coordinate on a Pareto-efficient outcome. Safe Pareto improvements (SPIs) were originally proposed to mitigate miscoordination in cases where players lack probabilistic beliefs as to how their delegates will play a game; delegates are instructed to behave so as to guarantee a Pareto improvement on how they would play by default. More generally, SPIs may be defined as transformations of strategy profiles such that all players are necessarily better off under the transformed profile. In this work, we investigate the extent to which SPIs can reduce downsides of miscoordination between expected utility-maximizing agents. We consider games in which players submit computer programs that can condition their decisions on each other's code, and use this property to construct SPIs using programs capable of renegotiation. We first show that under mild conditions on players' beliefs, each player always prefers to use renegotiation. Next, we show that under similar assumptions, each player always prefers to be willing to renegotiate at least to the point at which they receive the lowest payoff they can attain in any efficient outcome. Thus subjectively optimal play guarantees players at least these payoffs, without the need for coordination on specific Pareto improvements. Lastly, we prove that renegotiation does not guarantee players any improvements on this bound.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 24th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS-25)</p></details> |
| **[Aligning the Objective of LLM-based Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08877v5)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved decent results on automated program repair (APR). However, the next token prediction training objective of decoder-only LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) is misaligned with the masked span prediction objective of current infilling-style methods, which impedes LLMs from fully leveraging pre-trained knowledge for program repair. In addition, while some LLMs can locate and repair bugs in certain functions using the related artifacts (e.g., test cases), existing methods still depend on statement-level fault localization methods to provide a list of buggy hunks for repair. This restriction hinders LLMs from exploring potential patches beyond the given locations. In this paper, we investigate a new approach to adapt LLMs to program repair. Our core insight is that LLM's APR capability can be greatly improved by simply aligning the output to their training objective and allowing them to refine the whole program without first identifying faulty statements. Based on this insight, we designed D4C, a straightforward prompting framework for APR. D4C can repair 180 bugs correctly in Defects4J, with each patch being sampled only 10 times. This surpasses the SOTA APR methods with perfect fault localization by 10% and reduces the patch sampling number by 90%. Our findings reveal that (1) objective alignment is crucial for fully exploiting LLM's pre-trained capability, and (2) replacing the traditional localize-buggy-hunks-then-repair workflow with direct debugging is more effective for LLM-based APR methods. Thus, we believe this paper introduces a new mindset for harnessing LLMs in APR.</p></details> | Accepted by ICSE'25 |
| **[Towards Secure Program Partitioning for Smart Contracts with LLM's In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14215v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts are highly susceptible to manipulation attacks due to the leakage of sensitive information. Addressing manipulation vulnerabilities is particularly challenging because they stem from inherent data confidentiality issues rather than straightforward implementation bugs. To tackle this by preventing sensitive information leakage, we present PartitionGPT, the first LLM-driven approach that combines static analysis with the in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to partition smart contracts into privileged and normal codebases, guided by a few annotated sensitive data variables. We evaluated PartitionGPT on 18 annotated smart contracts containing 99 sensitive functions. The results demonstrate that PartitionGPT successfully generates compilable, and verified partitions for 78% of the sensitive functions while reducing approximately 30% code compared to function-level partitioning approach. Furthermore, we evaluated PartitionGPT on nine real-world manipulation attacks that lead to a total loss of 25 million dollars, PartitionGPT effectively prevents eight cases, highlighting its potential for broad applicability and the necessity for secure program partitioning during smart contract development to diminish manipulation vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autellix: An Efficient Serving Engine for LLM Agents as General Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13965v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) applications are evolving beyond simple chatbots into dynamic, general-purpose agentic programs, which scale LLM calls and output tokens to help AI agents reason, explore, and solve complex tasks. However, existing LLM serving systems ignore dependencies between programs and calls, missing significant opportunities for optimization. Our analysis reveals that programs submitted to LLM serving engines experience long cumulative wait times, primarily due to head-of-line blocking at both the individual LLM request and the program. To address this, we introduce Autellix, an LLM serving system that treats programs as first-class citizens to minimize their end-to-end latencies. Autellix intercepts LLM calls submitted by programs, enriching schedulers with program-level context. We propose two scheduling algorithms-for single-threaded and distributed programs-that preempt and prioritize LLM calls based on their programs' previously completed calls. Our evaluation demonstrates that across diverse LLMs and agentic workloads, Autellix improves throughput of programs by 4-15x at the same latency compared to state-of-the-art systems, such as vLLM.</p></details> |  |

Programming marathons have grown over the years and are events where programmers compete to solve coding challenges. However, despite scientific evidence that there is no intellectual difference between genders, women's participation is relatively low. This work seeks to understand the reason for this adherence, considering the gender issue in Programming Marathons over the last years, in a real context. This work aims to understand the context of female representativeness in which the intellectual aspects do not differ in gender. Still, there is a considerable discrepancy in female belonging.</p></details> | 9 pages |

We argue that successfully deploying AI software engineers requires a level of trust equal to or even greater than the trust established by human-driven software engineering practices. The recent trend toward LLM agents offers a path toward integrating the power of LLMs to create new code with the power of analysis tools to increase trust in the code. This opinion piece comments on whether LLM agents could dominate software engineering workflows in the future and whether the focus of programming will shift from programming at scale to programming with trust.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[AutoTEE: Automated Migration and Protection of Programs in Trusted Execution Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13379v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) isolate a special space within a device's memory that is not accessible to the normal world (also known as Untrusted Environment), even when the device is compromised. Thus, developers can utilize TEEs to provide strong security guarantees for their programs, making sensitive operations like encrypted data storage, fingerprint verification, and remote attestation protected from malicious attacks. Despite the strong protections offered by TEEs, adapting existing programs to leverage such security guarantees is non-trivial, often requiring extensive domain knowledge and manual intervention, which makes TEEs less accessible to developers. This motivates us to design AutoTEE, the first Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled approach that can automatically identify, partition, transform, and port sensitive functions into TEEs with minimal developer intervention. By manually reviewing 68 repositories, we constructed a benchmark dataset consisting of 385 sensitive functions eligible for transformation, on which AutoTEE achieves a high F1 score of 0.91. AutoTEE effectively transforms these sensitive functions into their TEE-compatible counterparts, achieving success rates of 90\% and 83\% for Java and Python, respectively. We further provide a mechanism to automatically port the transformed code to different TEE platforms, including Intel SGX and AMD SEV, demonstrating that the transformed programs run successfully and correctly on these platforms.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Template-Based Visual Program Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08564v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For users with limited computational resources, visual programming or prompting large language models (LLMs) to generate executable code for visual tasks, like visual question answering (VQA), remains largely inaccessible. Even with techniques such as distillation, adapting visual programming to smaller models or specific datasets is still quite challenging due to high annotation costs. We propose a low-cost visual program distillation method that can be used for models with fewer than 1 billion parameters and requires no human-generated program annotations. We achieve this through synthetic data augmentation based on decoupling programs into higher-level skills, called templates, and their corresponding arguments. Experimental results show that, with a relatively small amount of question/answer data, small language models can generate high-quality visual programs with the added benefit of much faster inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Competitive Programming with Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06807v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLMs) significantly boosts performance on complex coding and reasoning tasks. Additionally, we compare two general-purpose reasoning models - OpenAI o1 and an early checkpoint of o3 - with a domain-specific system, o1-ioi, which uses hand-engineered inference strategies designed for competing in the 2024 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). We competed live at IOI 2024 with o1-ioi and, using hand-crafted test-time strategies, placed in the 49th percentile. Under relaxed competition constraints, o1-ioi achieved a gold medal. However, when evaluating later models such as o3, we find that o3 achieves gold without hand-crafted domain-specific strategies or relaxed constraints. Our findings show that although specialized pipelines such as o1-ioi yield solid improvements, the scaled-up, general-purpose o3 model surpasses those results without relying on hand-crafted inference heuristics. Notably, o3 achieves a gold medal at the 2024 IOI and obtains a Codeforces rating on par with elite human competitors. Overall, these results indicate that scaling general-purpose reinforcement learning, rather than relying on domain-specific techniques, offers a robust path toward state-of-the-art AI in reasoning domains, such as competitive programming.</p></details> |  |

Our approach enables in-situ data recording, visualization, and fine-tuning of skill demonstrations directly within the user's physical environment. RAMPA addresses critical challenges of PbD, such as safety concerns, programming barriers, and the inefficiency of collecting demonstrations on the actual hardware. The performance of our system is evaluated against the traditional method of kinesthetic control in teaching three different robotic manipulation tasks and analyzed with quantitative metrics, measuring task performance and completion time, trajectory smoothness, system usability, user experience, and task load using standardized surveys. Our findings indicate a substantial advancement in how robotic tasks are taught and refined, promising improvements in operational safety, efficiency, and user engagement in robotic programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is the final version submitted to the IEEE RA-L</p></details> |
| **[Performance Evaluation of Large Language Models in Statistical Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13117v1)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The programming capabilities of large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized automatic code generation and opened new avenues for automatic statistical analysis. However, the validity and quality of these generated codes need to be systematically evaluated before they can be widely adopted. Despite their growing prominence, a comprehensive evaluation of statistical code generated by LLMs remains scarce in the literature. In this paper, we assess the performance of LLMs, including two versions of ChatGPT and one version of Llama, in the domain of SAS programming for statistical analysis. Our study utilizes a set of statistical analysis tasks encompassing diverse statistical topics and datasets. Each task includes a problem description, dataset information, and human-verified SAS code. We conduct a comprehensive assessment of the quality of SAS code generated by LLMs through human expert evaluation based on correctness, effectiveness, readability, executability, and the accuracy of output results. The analysis of rating scores reveals that while LLMs demonstrate usefulness in generating syntactically correct code, they struggle with tasks requiring deep domain understanding and may produce redundant or incorrect results. This study offers valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in statistical programming, providing guidance for future advancements in AI-assisted coding systems for statistical analysis.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |
| **[Statistical Inference of Constrained Stochastic Optimization via Sketched Sequential Quadratic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13687v5)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider online statistical inference of constrained stochastic nonlinear optimization problems. We apply the Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming (StoSQP) method to solve these problems, which can be regarded as applying second-order Newton's method to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. In each iteration, the StoSQP method computes the Newton direction by solving a quadratic program, and then selects a proper adaptive stepsize $\bar{\alpha}_t$ to update the primal-dual iterate. To reduce dominant computational cost of the method, we inexactly solve the quadratic program in each iteration by employing an iterative sketching solver. Notably, the approximation error of the sketching solver need not vanish as iterations proceed, meaning that the per-iteration computational cost does not blow up. For the above StoSQP method, we show that under mild assumptions, the rescaled primal-dual sequence $1/\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}\cdot (x_t - x^\star, \lambda_t - \lambda^\star)$ converges to a mean-zero Gaussian distribution with a nontrivial covariance matrix depending on the underlying sketching distribution. To perform inference in practice, we also analyze a plug-in covariance matrix estimator. We illustrate the asymptotic normality result of the method both on benchmark nonlinear problems in CUTEst test set and on linearly/nonlinearly constrained regression problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>72 pa...</summary><p>72 pages, 2 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Inferring Accumulative Effects of Higher Order Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02791v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many temporal safety properties of higher-order programs go beyond simple event sequencing and require an automaton register (or "accumulator") to express, such as input-dependency, event summation, resource usage, ensuring equal event magnitude, computation cost, etc. Some steps have been made towards verifying more basic temporal event sequences via reductions to fair termination [Murase et al. 2016] or some input-dependent properties through deductive proof systems [Nanjo et al. 2018]. However, there are currently no automated techniques to verify the more general class of register-automaton safety properties of higher-order programs. We introduce an abstract interpretation-based analysis to compute dependent, register-automata effects of recursive, higher-order programs. We capture properties of a program's effects in terms of automata that summarizes the history of observed effects using an accumulator register. The key novelty is a new abstract domain for context-dependent effects, capable of abstracting relations between the program environment, the automaton control state, and the accumulator value. The upshot is a dataflow type and effect system that computes context-sensitive effect summaries. We demonstrate our work via a prototype implementation that computes dependent effect summaries (and validates assertions) for OCaml-like recursive higher order programs. As a basis of comparison, we describe reductions to assertion checking for effect-free programs, and demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior tools Drift and RCaml/PCSat. Overall, across a set of 21 new benchmarks, RCaml/PCSat could not verify any, Drift verified 9 benchmarks, and evDrift verified 19; evDrift also had a 30.5x over Drift on those benchmarks that both tools could solve.</p></details> |  |
