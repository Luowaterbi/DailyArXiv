| **[CAD-Coder: An Open-Source Vision-Language Model for Computer-Aided Design Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14646v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient creation of accurate and editable 3D CAD models is critical in engineering design, significantly impacting cost and time-to-market in product innovation. Current manual workflows remain highly time-consuming and demand extensive user expertise. While recent developments in AI-driven CAD generation show promise, existing models are limited by incomplete representations of CAD operations, inability to generalize to real-world images, and low output accuracy. This paper introduces CAD-Coder, an open-source Vision-Language Model (VLM) explicitly fine-tuned to generate editable CAD code (CadQuery Python) directly from visual input. Leveraging a novel dataset that we created--GenCAD-Code, consisting of over 163k CAD-model image and code pairs--CAD-Coder outperforms state-of-the-art VLM baselines such as GPT-4.5 and Qwen2.5-VL-72B, achieving a 100% valid syntax rate and the highest accuracy in 3D solid similarity. Notably, our VLM demonstrates some signs of generalizability, successfully generating CAD code from real-world images and executing CAD operations unseen during fine-tuning. The performance and adaptability of CAD-Coder highlights the potential of VLMs fine-tuned on code to streamline CAD workflows for engineers and designers. CAD-Coder is publicly available at: https://github.com/anniedoris/CAD-Coder.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Predictive Coding and MDL: A Two-Part Code Framework for Deep Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14635v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first theoretical framework that connects predictive coding (PC), a biologically inspired local learning rule, with the minimum description length (MDL) principle in deep networks. We prove that layerwise PC performs block-coordinate descent on the MDL two-part code objective, thereby jointly minimizing empirical risk and model complexity. Using Hoeffding's inequality and a prefix-code prior, we derive a novel generalization bound of the form $R(\theta) \le \^{R}(\theta) + \frac{L(\theta)}{N}$, capturing the tradeoff between fit and compression. We further prove that each PC sweep monotonically decreases the empirical two-part codelength, yielding tighter high-probability risk bounds than unconstrained gradient descent. Finally, we show that repeated PC updates converge to a block-coordinate stationary point, providing an approximate MDL-optimal solution. To our knowledge, this is the first result offering formal generalization and convergence guarantees for PC-trained deep models, positioning PC as a theoretically grounded and biologically plausible alternative to backpropagation.</p></details> | 24 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Success is in the Details: Evaluate and Enhance Details Sensitivity of Code LLMs through Counterfactuals](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14597v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code Sensitivity refers to the ability of Code LLMs to recognize and respond to details changes in problem descriptions. While current code benchmarks and instruction data focus on difficulty and diversity, sensitivity is overlooked. We first introduce the CTF-Code benchmark, constructed using counterfactual perturbations, minimizing input changes while maximizing output changes. The evaluation shows that many LLMs have a more than 10\% performance drop compared to the original problems. To fully utilize sensitivity, CTF-Instruct, an incremental instruction fine-tuning framework, extends on existing data and uses a selection mechanism to meet the three dimensions of difficulty, diversity, and sensitivity. Experiments show that LLMs fine-tuned with CTF-Instruct data achieve over a 2\% improvement on CTF-Code, and more than a 10\% performance boost on LiveCodeBench, validating the feasibility of enhancing LLMs' sensitivity to improve performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code & Model is https://github.com/Luowaterbi/CTF-Instruct</p></details> |
| **[Duals of multiplicity codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14472v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multivariate multiplicity codes have been recently explored because of their importance for list decoding and local decoding. Given a multivariate multiplicity code, in this paper, we compute its dimension using Gr\"obner basis tools, its dual in terms of indicator functions, and explicitly describe a parity-check matrix. In contrast with Reed--Muller, Reed--Solomon, univariate multiplicity, and other evaluation codes, the dual of a multivariate multiplicity code is not equivalent or isometric to a multiplicity code (i.e., this code family is not closed under duality). We use our explicit description to provide a lower bound on the minimum distance for the dual of a multiplicity code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Attributional Safety Failures in Large Language Models under Code-Mixed Perturbations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14469v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in LLMs have raised significant safety concerns, particularly when dealing with code-mixed inputs and outputs. Our study systematically investigates the increased susceptibility of LLMs to produce unsafe outputs from code-mixed prompts compared to monolingual English prompts. Utilizing explainability methods, we dissect the internal attribution shifts causing model's harmful behaviors. In addition, we explore cultural dimensions by distinguishing between universally unsafe and culturally-specific unsafe queries. This paper presents novel experimental insights, clarifying the mechanisms driving this phenomenon.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Mitigating API Hallucination in Code Generated by LLMs with Hierarchical Dependency Aware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.05057v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are crucial in modern software development. Large Language Models (LLMs) assist in automated code generation but often struggle with API hallucination, including invoking non-existent APIs and misusing existing ones in practical development scenarios. Existing studies resort to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) methods for mitigating the hallucination issue, but tend to fail since they generally ignore the structural dependencies in practical projects and do not indeed validate whether the generated APIs are available or not. To address these limitations, we propose MARIN, a framework for mitigating API hallucination in code generated by LLMs with hierarchical dependency aware. MARIN consists of two phases: Hierarchical Dependency Mining, which analyzes local and global dependencies of the current function, aiming to supplement comprehensive project context in LLMs input, and Dependency Constrained Decoding, which utilizes mined dependencies to adaptively constrain the generation process, aiming to ensure the generated APIs align with the projects specifications. To facilitate the evaluation of the degree of API hallucination, we introduce a new benchmark APIHulBench and two new metrics including Micro Hallucination Number (MiHN) and Macro Hallucination Rate (MaHR). Experiments on six state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that MARIN effectively reduces API hallucinations, achieving an average decrease of 67.52% in MiHN and 73.56% in MaHR compared to the RAG approach. Applied to Huaweis internal projects and two proprietary LLMs, MARIN achieves average decreases of 57.33% in MiHN and 59.41% in MaHR.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by FSE 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |
| **[Knowledge Graph Based Repository-Level Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14394v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed code generation from natural language queries. However, despite their extensive knowledge and ability to produce high-quality code, LLMs often struggle with contextual accuracy, particularly in evolving codebases. Current code search and retrieval methods frequently lack robustness in both the quality and contextual relevance of retrieved results, leading to suboptimal code generation. This paper introduces a novel knowledge graph-based approach to improve code search and retrieval leading to better quality of code generation in the context of repository-level tasks. The proposed approach represents code repositories as graphs, capturing structural and relational information for enhanced context-aware code generation. Our framework employs a hybrid approach for code retrieval to improve contextual relevance, track inter-file modular dependencies, generate more robust code and ensure consistency with the existing codebase. We benchmark the proposed approach on the Evolutionary Code Benchmark (EvoCodeBench) dataset, a repository-level code generation benchmark, and demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the baseline approach. These findings suggest that knowledge graph based code generation could advance robust, context-sensitive coding assistance tools.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Relational Hoare Logic for Realistically Modelled Machine Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14348v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many security- and performance-critical domains, such as cryptography, rely on low-level verification to minimize the trusted computing surface and allow code to be written directly in assembly. However, verifying assembly code against a realistic machine model is a challenging task. Furthermore, certain security properties -- such as constant-time behavior -- require relational reasoning that goes beyond traditional correctness by linking multiple execution traces within a single specification. Yet, relational verification has been extensively explored at a higher level of abstraction. In this work, we introduce a Hoare-style logic that provides low-level, expressive relational verification. We demonstrate our approach on the s2n-bignum library, proving both constant-time discipline and equivalence between optimized and verification-friendly routines. Formalized in HOL Light, our results confirm the real-world applicability of relational verification in large assembly codebases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Denis...</summary><p>Denis Mazzucato and Abdalrhman Mohamed contributed equally to this work; Juneyoung Lee is the corresponding author: lebjuney@amazon.com; 29 pages, 3 Figures; accepted at the 37th International Conference on Computer Aided Verification (CAV) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Lifting a CSS code via its handlebody realization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14327v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a topological approach to lifting a quantum CSS code. In previous work, we proposed lifting a CSS code by constructing covering spaces over its 2D simplicial complex representation, known as the Tanner cone-complex. This idea was inspired by the work of Freedman and Hastings, which associates CSS codes with handlebodies. In this paper, we show how the handlebody realization of a code can also be used to perform code lifting, and we provide a more detailed discussion of why this is essentially equivalent to the Tanner cone-complex approach. As an application, we classify lifts of hypergraph-product codes via their handlebody realization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Who Introduces and Who Fixes? Analyzing Code Quality in Collaborative Student's Projects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14315v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates code quality education by analyzing how errors are introduced and corrected in group projects within an embedded systems course. We identify who introduces errors, who fixes them, and when these actions occur. Students learn code quality rules for C and embedded systems. We address three questions: RQ1: What is the impact of group formation on code quality? RQ2: How do students interact to fix code issues? RQ3: When are issues introduced and resolved? We analyzed data from eight individual labs and two group projects involving 34 students. The course provides continuous, automated feedback on code quality. Findings show that the most active contributors often introduce the most issues. Many issues are fixed late in the project. Individual labs tend to have fewer issues due to their structured nature. Most problems are fixed by the original author, while cross-student fixes take longer, especially in shared code. Critical issues are fixed quickly, but non-critical ones may be ignored, showing a focus on functionality over quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Information-Set Decoding for Convolutional Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07621v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a framework for generic decoding of convolutional codes, which allows us to do cryptanalysis of code-based systems that use convolutional codes. We then apply this framework to information set decoding, study success probabilities and give tools to choose variables. Finally, we use this to attack two cryptosystems based on convolutional codes. In the first, our code recovered about 74% of errors in less than 10 hours each, and in the second case, we give experimental evidence that 80% of the errors can be recovered in times corresponding to about 70 bits of operational security, with some instances being significantly lower.</p></details> |  |
| **[Knowledge-Guided Prompt Learning for Request Quality Assurance in Public Code Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21673v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Public Code Review (PCR) is developed in the Software Question Answering (SQA) community, assisting developers in exploring high-quality and efficient review services. Current methods on PCR mainly focus on the reviewer's perspective, including finding a capable reviewer, predicting comment quality, and recommending/generating review comments. However, it is not well studied that how to satisfy the review necessity requests posted by developers which can increase their visibility, which in turn acts as a prerequisite for better review responses. To this end, we propose Knowledge-guided Prompt learning for Public Code Review (KP-PCR) to achieve developer-based code review request quality assurance (i.e., predicting request necessity and recommending tags subtask). Specifically, we reformulate the two subtasks via 1) text prompt tuning which converts both of them into a Masked Language Model (MLM) by constructing prompt templates using hard prompt; and 2) knowledge and code prefix tuning which introduces knowledge guidance from fine-tuned large language models by soft prompt, and uses program dependence graph to characterize code snippets. Finally, both of the request necessity prediction and tag recommendation subtasks output predicted results through an answer engineering module. In addition, we further analysis the time complexity of our KP-PCR that has lightweight prefix based the operation of introducing knowledge guidance. Experimental results on the PCR dataset for the period 2011-2023 demonstrate that our KP-PCR outperforms baselines by 2.3%-8.4% in the request necessity prediction and by 1.4%-6.9% in the tag recommendation. The code implementation is released at https://github.com/WUT-IDEA/KP-PCR.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 5 images, 12 tables, Manuscript revision submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **["Haet Bhasha aur Diskrimineshun": Phonetic Perturbations in Code-Mixed Hinglish to Red-Team LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14226v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become increasingly powerful, with multilingual and multimodal capabilities improving by the day. These models are being evaluated through audits, alignment studies and red-teaming efforts to expose model vulnerabilities towards generating harmful, biased and unfair content. Existing red-teaming efforts have previously focused on the English language, using fixed template-based attacks; thus, models continue to be susceptible to multilingual jailbreaking strategies, especially in the multimodal context. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages code-mixing and phonetic perturbations to jailbreak LLMs for both text and image generation tasks. We also introduce two new jailbreak strategies that show higher effectiveness than baseline strategies. Our work presents a method to effectively bypass safety filters in LLMs while maintaining interpretability by applying phonetic misspellings to sensitive words in code-mixed prompts. Our novel prompts achieve a 99% Attack Success Rate for text generation and 78% for image generation, with Attack Relevance Rate of 100% for text generation and 95% for image generation when using the phonetically perturbed code-mixed prompts. Our interpretability experiments reveal that phonetic perturbations impact word tokenization, leading to jailbreak success. Our study motivates increasing the focus towards more generalizable safety alignment for multilingual multimodal models, especially in real-world settings wherein prompts can have misspelt words.</p></details> |  |
| **[Capturing the Effects of Quantization on Trojans in Code LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14200v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models of code exhibit high capability in performing diverse software engineering tasks, such as code translation, defect detection, text-to-code generation, and code summarization. While their ability to enhance developer productivity has spurred widespread use, these models have also seen substantial growth in size, often reaching billions of parameters. This scale demands efficient memory resource usage, prompting practitioners to use optimization techniques such as model quantization. Quantization uses smaller bit representations for the model parameters, reducing the precision of the weights. In this work, we investigate the impact of quantization on the risk of data poisoning attacks on these models, specifically examining whether it mitigates or exacerbates such vulnerabilities. We focus on two large language models, Meta's Llama-2-7b and CodeLlama-7b, applied to an SQL code generation task. Additionally, we introduce a new metric for measuring trojan signals in compromised models. We find that quantization has differing effects on code-generating LLMs: while reducing precision does not significantly alter Llama-2's behavior, it boosts performance and reduces attack success rates in CodeLlama, particularly at 4-bit precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Capability of Code Review as a Communication Network](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13985v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Code review, a core practice in software engineering, has been widely studied as a collaborative process, with prior work suggesting it functions as a communication network. However, this theory remains untested, limiting its practical and theoretical significance. Objective: This study aims to (1) formalize the theory of code review as a communication network explicit and (2) empirically test its validity by quantifying how widely and how quickly information can spread in code review. Method: We replicate an in-silico experiment simulating information diffusion -- the spread of information among participants -- under best-case conditions across three open-source (Android, Visual Studio Code, React) and three closed-source code review systems (Microsoft, Spotify, Trivago) each modeled as communication network. By measuring the number of reachable participants and the minimal topological and temporal distances, we quantify how widely and how quickly information can spread through code review. Results: We demonstrate that code review can enable both wide and fast information diffusion, even at a large scale. However, this capacity varies: open-source code review spreads information faster, while closed-source review reaches more participants. Conclusion: Our findings reinforce and refine the theory, highlighting implications for measuring collaboration, generalizing open-source studies, and the role of AI in shaping future code review.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2306.08980</p></details> |
| **[XOXO: Stealthy Cross-Origin Context Poisoning Attacks against AI Coding Assistants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14281v3)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI coding assistants are widely used for tasks like code generation. These tools now require large and complex contexts, automatically sourced from various origins$\unicode{x2014}$across files, projects, and contributors$\unicode{x2014}$forming part of the prompt fed to underlying LLMs. This automatic context-gathering introduces new vulnerabilities, allowing attackers to subtly poison input to compromise the assistant's outputs, potentially generating vulnerable code or introducing critical errors. We propose a novel attack, Cross-Origin Context Poisoning (XOXO), that is challenging to detect as it relies on adversarial code modifications that are semantically equivalent. Traditional program analysis techniques struggle to identify these perturbations since the semantics of the code remains correct, making it appear legitimate. This allows attackers to manipulate coding assistants into producing incorrect outputs, while shifting the blame to the victim developer. We introduce a novel, task-agnostic, black-box attack algorithm GCGS that systematically searches the transformation space using a Cayley Graph, achieving a 75.72% attack success rate on average across five tasks and eleven models, including GPT 4.1 and Claude 3.5 Sonnet v2 used by popular AI coding assistants. Furthermore, defenses like adversarial fine-tuning are ineffective against our attack, underscoring the need for new security measures in LLM-powered coding tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sense and Sensitivity: Examining the Influence of Semantic Recall on Long Context Code Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13353v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although modern Large Language Models (LLMs) support extremely large contexts, their effectiveness in utilizing long context for code reasoning remains unclear. This paper investigates LLM reasoning ability over code snippets within large repositories and how it relates to their recall ability. Specifically, we differentiate between lexical code recall (verbatim retrieval) and semantic code recall (remembering what the code does). To measure semantic recall, we propose SemTrace, a code reasoning technique where the impact of specific statements on output is attributable and unpredictable. We also present a method to quantify semantic recall sensitivity in existing benchmarks. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals a significant drop in code reasoning accuracy as a code snippet approaches the middle of the input context, particularly with techniques requiring high semantic recall like SemTrace. Moreover, we find that lexical recall varies by granularity, with models excelling at function retrieval but struggling with line-by-line recall. Notably, a disconnect exists between lexical and semantic recall, suggesting different underlying mechanisms. Finally, our findings indicate that current code reasoning benchmarks may exhibit low semantic recall sensitivity, potentially underestimating LLM challenges in leveraging in-context information.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLEVER: A Curated Benchmark for Formally Verified Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13938v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$, a high-quality, curated benchmark of 161 problems for end-to-end verified code generation in Lean. Each problem consists of (1) the task of generating a specification that matches a held-out ground-truth specification, and (2) the task of generating a Lean implementation that provably satisfies this specification. Unlike prior benchmarks, ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$ avoids test-case supervision, LLM-generated annotations, and specifications that leak implementation logic or allow vacuous solutions. All outputs are verified post-hoc using Lean's type checker to ensure machine-checkable correctness. We use ${\rm C{\small LEVER}}$ to evaluate several few-shot and agentic approaches based on state-of-the-art language models. These methods all struggle to achieve full verification, establishing it as a challenging frontier benchmark for program synthesis and formal reasoning. Our benchmark can be found on GitHub(https://github.com/trishullab/clever) as well as HuggingFace(https://huggingface.co/datasets/amitayusht/clever). All our evaluation code is also available online(https://github.com/trishullab/clever-prover).</p></details> |  |
| **[Code2Logic: Game-Code-Driven Data Synthesis for Enhancing VLMs General Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13886v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual-language Chain-of-Thought (CoT) data resources are relatively scarce compared to text-only counterparts, limiting the improvement of reasoning capabilities in Vision Language Models (VLMs). However, high-quality vision-language reasoning data is expensive and labor-intensive to annotate. To address this issue, we leverage a promising resource: game code, which naturally contains logical structures and state transition processes. Therefore, we propose Code2Logic, a novel game-code-driven approach for multimodal reasoning data synthesis. Our approach leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt game code, enabling automatic acquisition of reasoning processes and results through code execution. Using the Code2Logic approach, we developed the GameQA dataset to train and evaluate VLMs. GameQA is cost-effective and scalable to produce, challenging for state-of-the-art models, and diverse with 30 games and 158 tasks. Surprisingly, despite training solely on game data, VLMs demonstrated out of domain generalization, specifically Qwen2.5-VL-7B improving performance by 2.33\% across 7 diverse vision-language benchmarks. Our code and dataset are available at https://github.com/tongjingqi/Code2Logic.</p></details> | <details><summary>49 pa...</summary><p>49 pages, 19 figures, submitted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Matryoshka: Revisiting Sparse Coding for Adaptive Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01776v5)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many large-scale systems rely on high-quality deep representations (embeddings) to facilitate tasks like retrieval, search, and generative modeling. Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) recently emerged as a solution for adaptive embedding lengths, but it requires full model retraining and suffers from noticeable performance degradations at short lengths. In this paper, we show that sparse coding offers a compelling alternative for achieving adaptive representation with minimal overhead and higher fidelity. We propose Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR), a method that sparsifies pre-trained embeddings into a high-dimensional but selectively activated feature space. By leveraging lightweight autoencoding and task-aware contrastive objectives, CSR preserves semantic quality while allowing flexible, cost-effective inference at different sparsity levels. Extensive experiments on image, text, and multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that CSR consistently outperforms MRL in terms of both accuracy and retrieval speed-often by large margins-while also cutting training time to a fraction of that required by MRL. Our results establish sparse coding as a powerful paradigm for adaptive representation learning in real-world applications where efficiency and fidelity are both paramount.

| **[OSS-Bench: Benchmark Generator for Coding LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12331v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In light of the rapid adoption of AI coding assistants, LLM-assisted development has become increasingly prevalent, creating an urgent need for robust evaluation of generated code quality. Existing benchmarks often require extensive manual effort to create static datasets, rely on indirect or insufficiently challenging tasks, depend on non-scalable ground truth, or neglect critical low-level security evaluations, particularly memory-safety issues. In this work, we introduce OSS-Bench, a benchmark generator that automatically constructs large-scale, live evaluation tasks from real-world open-source software. OSS-Bench replaces functions with LLM-generated code and evaluates them using three natural metrics: compilability, functional correctness, and memory safety, leveraging robust signals like compilation failures, test-suite violations, and sanitizer alerts as ground truth. In our evaluation, the benchmark, instantiated as OSS-Bench(php) and OSS-Bench(sql), profiles 17 diverse LLMs, revealing insights such as intra-family behavioral patterns and inconsistencies between model size and performance. Our results demonstrate that OSS-Bench mitigates overfitting by leveraging the evolving complexity of OSS and highlights LLMs' limited understanding of low-level code security via extended fuzzing experiments. Overall, OSS-Bench offers a practical and scalable framework for benchmarking the real-world coding capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[MigrationBench: Repository-Level Code Migration Benchmark from Java 8](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09569v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of powerful large language models (LLMs) in recent years, a wide range of software engineering tasks can now be addressed using LLMs, significantly enhancing productivity and scalability. Numerous benchmark datasets have been developed to evaluate the coding capabilities of these models, while they primarily focus on code generation and issue-resolution tasks. In contrast, we introduce a new coding benchmark MigrationBench with a distinct focus: code migration. MigrationBench aims to serve as a comprehensive benchmark for migration from Java $8$ to the latest long-term support (LTS) versions (Java $17$, $21$), including a full dataset and its subset selected with $5,102$ and $300$ repositories respectively. Selected is a representative subset curated for complexity and difficulty, offering a versatile resource to support research in the field of code migration. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive evaluation framework to facilitate rigorous and standardized assessment of LLMs on this challenging task. We further propose SD-Feedback and demonstrate that LLMs can effectively tackle repository-level code migration to Java $17$. For the selected subset with Claude-3.5-Sonnet-v2, SD-Feedback achieves $62.33\%$ and $27.33\%$ success rate (pass@1) for minimal and maximal migration respectively. The benchmark dataset and source code are available at: https://huggingface.co/collections/AmazonScience/migrationbench-68125452fc21a4564b92b6c3 and https://github.com/amazon-science/MigrationBench respectively.</p></details> |  |

A case study of LLM-driven configuration code generation for automotive simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13263v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are taking many industries by storm. They possess impressive reasoning capabilities and are capable of handling complex problems, as shown by their steadily improving scores on coding and mathematical benchmarks. However, are the models currently available truly capable of addressing real-world challenges, such as those found in the automotive industry? How well can they understand high-level, abstract instructions? Can they translate these instructions directly into functional code, or do they still need help and supervision? In this work, we put one of the current state-of-the-art models to the test. We evaluate its performance in the task of translating abstract requirements, extracted from automotive standards and documents, into configuration code for CARLA simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Natural Language Planning via Coding and Inference Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13252v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-life textual planning tasks such as meeting scheduling have posed much challenge to LLMs especially when the complexity is high. While previous work primarily studied auto-regressive generation of plans with closed-source models, we systematically evaluate both closed- and open-source models, including those that scales output length with complexity during inference, in generating programs, which are executed to output the plan. We consider not only standard Python code, but also the code to a constraint satisfaction problem solver. Despite the algorithmic nature of the task, we show that programming often but not always outperforms planning. Our detailed error analysis also indicates a lack of robustness and efficiency in the generated code that hinders generalization.</p></details> |  |
| **[$μ$PC: Scaling Predictive Coding to 100+ Layer Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13124v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The biological implausibility of backpropagation (BP) has motivated many alternative, brain-inspired algorithms that attempt to rely only on local information, such as predictive coding (PC) and equilibrium propagation. However, these algorithms have notoriously struggled to train very deep networks, preventing them from competing with BP in large-scale settings. Indeed, scaling PC networks (PCNs) has recently been posed as a challenge for the community (Pinchetti et al., 2024). Here, we show that 100+ layer PCNs can be trained reliably using a Depth-$\mu$P parameterisation (Yang et al., 2023; Bordelon et al., 2023) which we call "$\mu$PC". Through an extensive analysis of the scaling behaviour of PCNs, we reveal several pathologies that make standard PCNs difficult to train at large depths. We then show that, despite addressing only some of these instabilities, $\mu$PC allows stable training of very deep (up to 128-layer) residual networks on simple classification tasks with competitive performance and little tuning compared to current benchmarks. Moreover, $\mu$PC enables zero-shot transfer of both weight and activity learning rates across widths and depths.

However, in practical applications, there remains a gap between current commonly used code completion evaluation metrics and users' actual perception. To address this issue, we propose two evaluation metrics for code completion tasks--LCP and ROUGE-LCP, from the perspective of probabilistic modeling. Furthermore, to tackle the lack of effective structural semantic modeling and cross-module dependency information in LLMs for repository-level code completion scenarios, we propose a data processing method based on a Structure-Preserving and Semantically-Reordered Code Graph (SPSR-Graph). Through theoretical analysis and experimental validation, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed evaluation metrics in terms of user perception consistency, as well as the effectiveness of the data processing method in enhancing model performance.</p></details> | 14 pages,8 figures |

To address this gap, we introduce EffiBench-X, the first multi-language benchmark designed to measure the efficiency of LLM-generated code. EffiBench-X supports Python, C++, Java, JavaScript, Ruby, and Golang. It comprises competitive programming tasks with human-expert solutions as efficiency baselines. Evaluating state-of-the-art LLMs on EffiBench-X reveals that while models generate functionally correct code, they consistently underperform human experts in efficiency. Even the most efficient LLM-generated solutions (Qwen3-32B) achieve only around \textbf{62\%} of human efficiency on average, with significant language-specific variations. LLMs show better efficiency in Python, Ruby, and JavaScript than in Java, C++, and Golang. For instance, DeepSeek-R1's Python code is significantly more efficient than its Java code. These results highlight the critical need for research into LLM optimization techniques to improve code efficiency across diverse languages. The dataset and evaluation infrastructure are submitted and available at https://github.com/EffiBench/EffiBench-X.git and https://huggingface.co/datasets/EffiBench/effibench-x.</p></details> | Under Review |

In this paper, we first give a general method to transform a minimal code satisfying the Ashikhmin-Barg condition to a minimal code violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition. Then we give a construction of a minimal code satisfying the Ashikhmin-Barg condition from an arbitrary projective linear code. Hence an arbitrary projective linear code can be transformed to a minimal codes violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition. Then we give infinite many families of minimal codes violating the Ashikhamin-Barg condition. Weight distributions of constructed minimal codes violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition in this paper are determined. Many minimal linear codes violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition with their minimum weights close to the optimal or the best known minimum weights of linear codes are constructed in this paper. Moreover, many infinite families of self-orthogonal binary minimal codes violating the Ashikhmin-Barg condition are also given.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, minor error corrected</p></details> |

However, there remains a lack of standardized tools for automatic evaluation in this domain. To address this gap, we propose AutoGEEval, the first multimodal, unit-level automated evaluation framework for geospatial code generation tasks on the Google Earth Engine (GEE) platform powered by large language models (LLMs). Built upon the GEE Python API, AutoGEEval establishes a benchmark suite (AutoGEEval-Bench) comprising 1325 test cases that span 26 GEE data types. The framework integrates both question generation and answer verification components to enable an end-to-end automated evaluation pipeline-from function invocation to execution validation. AutoGEEval supports multidimensional quantitative analysis of model outputs in terms of accuracy, resource consumption, execution efficiency, and error types. We evaluate 18 state-of-the-art LLMs-including general-purpose, reasoning-augmented, code-centric, and geoscience-specialized models-revealing their performance characteristics and potential optimization pathways in GEE code generation. This work provides a unified protocol and foundational resource for the development and assessment of geospatial code generation models, advancing the frontier of automated natural language to domain-specific code translation.</p></details> |  |

CS-Sum is the first benchmark for CS dialogue summarization across Mandarin-English (EN-ZH), Tamil-English (EN-TA), and Malay-English (EN-MS), with 900-1300 human-annotated dialogues per language pair. Evaluating ten LLMs, including open and closed-source models, we analyze performance across few-shot, translate-summarize, and fine-tuning (LoRA, QLoRA on synthetic data) approaches. Our findings show that though the scores on automated metrics are high, LLMs make subtle mistakes that alter the complete meaning of the dialogue. To this end, we introduce 3 most common type of errors that LLMs make when handling CS input. Error rates vary across CS pairs and LLMs, with some LLMs showing more frequent errors on certain language pairs, underscoring the need for specialized training on code-switched data.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 5 figures and 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Selective Code Generation for Functional Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13553v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) show human-level performance and their specialized descendants, code generation models, play core roles in solving complex tasks, including mathematical reasoning and software development. On the downside, the hallucination of LLMs mainly hinders their applicability to systems requiring higher safety standards, thus drawing the attention of the AI community. However, the hallucination of code generation models is rarely considered. One critical bottleneck in considering code hallucination is the intricate property of code to identify whether generated code has the intended functionality due to its un-natural form, different to natural languages. Handful of unit tests have been considered to address this issue, but scaling-up its size is extremely expensive. We address this core bottleneck by automatically generating unit tests using dynamic code analysis tools, which leverages the \emph{executable nature} of code. Given generated unit tests from true code for measuring functional correctness of generated code, we propose to learn a \emph{selective code generator}, which abstains from answering for unsure generation, to control the rate of code hallucination among non-abstaining answers in terms of a false discovery rate. This learning algorithm provides a controllability guarantee, providing trustworthiness of code generation. Finally, we propose to use generated unit tests in evaluation as well as in learning for precise code evaluation, calling this evaluation paradigm \emph{FuzzEval}. We demonstrate the efficacy of our selective code generator over open and closed code generators, showing clear benefit of leveraging generated unit tests along with the controllability of code hallucination and reasonable selection efficiency via our selective code generator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards A Generalist Code Embedding Model Based On Massive Data Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12697v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code embedding models attract increasing attention due to the widespread popularity of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in software development. These models are expected to capture the rich semantic relationships inherent to code, which differ significantly from those found in text. However, existing models remain severely limited due to the scarcity of high-quality training data. In this work, we introduce \textbf{CodeR} (\underline{Code} \underline{R}etrieval), a state-of-the-art embedding model for general-purpose code retrieval. The superior performance of CodeR is built upon CodeR-Pile, a large-scale synthetic dataset constructed under the DRU (Diversity, Reliability, Usability) principle via a novel data synthesis pipeline. To optimize training effectiveness, we propose Annealing, a curriculum learning strategy that enables effective knowledge transfer across heterogeneous sources of data. We evaluate CodeR based on 16 diverse code retrieval tasks, where it significantly outperforms existing baselines and exhibits strong out-of-domain generalization performance. We have publicly released our code and the well-trained model to facilitate further research in this critical area. https://github.com/FlagOpen/FlagEmbedding/tree/master/research/BGE_Coder.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we propose CMLFormer, an enhanced multi-layer dual-decoder Transformer with a shared encoder and synchronized decoder cross-attention, designed to model the linguistic and semantic dynamics of code-mixed text. CMLFormer is pre-trained on an augmented Hinglish corpus with switching point and translation annotations with multiple new objectives specifically aimed at capturing switching behavior, cross-lingual structure, and code-mixing complexity. Our experiments show that CMLFormer improves F1 score, precision, and accuracy over other approaches on the HASOC-2021 benchmark under select pre-training setups. Attention analyses further show that it can identify and attend to switching points, validating its sensitivity to code-mixed structure. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of CMLFormer's architecture and multi-task pre-training strategy for modeling code-mixed languages.</p></details> |  |

In the meantime, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding scientific documents and generating high-quality code. Inspired by this, we introduce PaperCoder, a multi-agent LLM framework that transforms machine learning papers into functional code repositories. PaperCoder operates in three stages: planning, where it constructs a high-level roadmap, designs the system architecture with diagrams, identifies file dependencies, and generates configuration files; analysis, which focuses on interpreting implementation-specific details; and generation, where modular, dependency-aware code is produced. Moreover, each phase is instantiated through a set of specialized agents designed to collaborate effectively across the pipeline. We then evaluate PaperCoder on generating code implementations from machine learning papers based on both model-based and human evaluations, particularly from the authors of those papers, with author-released repositories as ground truth if available. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PaperCoder in creating high-quality, faithful implementations. Furthermore, it consistently shows strengths in the recently released PaperBench benchmark, surpassing strong baselines by substantial margins.

However, these models are susceptible to security vulnerabilities, drawing increasing research attention from domains such as software engineering, artificial intelligence, and cybersecurity. Despite the growing body of research focused on the security of CodeLMs, a comprehensive survey in this area remains absent. To address this gap, we systematically review 67 relevant papers, organizing them based on attack and defense strategies. Furthermore, we provide an overview of commonly used language models, datasets, and evaluation metrics, and highlight open-source tools and promising directions for future research in securing CodeLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |

Watermarking is a promising approach to distinguish machine-generated text from human text, embedding statistical signals in the output that are ideally undetectable to humans. We propose a watermarking framework that encodes such signals through an error correcting code. Our method, termed robust binary code (RBC) watermark, introduces no noticeable degradation in quality. We evaluate our watermark on base and instruction fine-tuned models and find our watermark is robust to edits, deletions, and translations. We provide an information-theoretic perspective on watermarking, a powerful statistical test for detection and for generating $p$-values, and theoretical guarantees. Our empirical findings suggest our watermark is fast, powerful, and robust, comparing favorably to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Code LLMs Do Static Analysis?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12118v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates code LLMs' capability of static analysis during code intelligence tasks such as code summarization and generation. Code LLMs are now household names for their abilities to do some programming tasks that have heretofore required people. The process that people follow to do programming tasks has long been understood to require static analysis. For example, human programmers navigate the call graph of large programs to comprehend the different parts of those programs. Education in programming includes static analysis under the assumption that better static analysis skills beget better programming. Yet while popular culture is replete with anthropomorphic references such as LLM "reasoning", in fact code LLMs could exhibit a wholly alien thought process to humans. This paper studies the specific question of static analysis by code LLMs. We use three different static analysis tasks (callgraph generation, AST generation, and dataflow generation) and three different code intelligence tasks (code generation, summarization, and translation) with two different open-source models (Gemini and GPT-4o) and closed-source models (CodeLlaMA and Jam) as our experiments. We found that LLMs show poor performance on static analysis tasks and that pretraining on the static analysis tasks does not generalize to better performance on the code intelligence tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 2 figures, Preprint in review</p></details> |

Benchmarking LLMs as Data Science Code Debuggers for Multi-Hop and Multi-Bug Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22388v2)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are transforming software development, yet current code generation and code repair benchmarks mainly assess syntactic and functional correctness in simple, single-error cases. LLMs' capabilities to autonomously find and fix runtime logical errors in complex data science code remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce DSDBench: the Data Science Debugging Benchmark, the first benchmark for systematic evaluation of LLMs on multi-hop error tracing and multi-bug detection in data science code debugging. DSDBench adapts datasets from existing data science task benchmarks, such as DABench and MatPlotBench, featuring realistic data science debugging tasks with automatically synthesized multi-hop, multi-bug code snippets. DSDBench includes 1,117 annotated samples with 741 cause-effect error pairs and runtime error messages. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on DSDBench show significant performance gaps, highlighting challenges in debugging logical runtime errors in data science code. DSDBench offers a crucial resource to evaluate and improve LLMs' debugging and reasoning capabilities, enabling more reliable AI-assisted data science in the future.

| **[Explicit Representatives and Sizes of Cyclotomic Cosets and their Application to Cyclic Codes over Finite Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12122v2)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyclotomic coset is a classical notion in the theory of finite field which has wide applications in various computation problems. Let $q$ be a prime power, and $n$ be a positive integer coprime to $q$. In this paper we determine explicitly the representatives and the sizes of all $q$-cyclotomic cosets modulo $n$ in the general settings. We introduce the definition of $2$-adic cyclotomic system, which is a profinite space consists of certain compatible sequences of cyclotomic cosets. A precise characterization of the structure of the $2$-adic cyclotomic system is given, which reveals the general formula for representatives of cyclotomic cosets. With the representatives and the sizes of $q$-cyclotomic cosets modulo $n$, we improve the formulas for the factorizations of $X^{n}-1$ and of $\Phi_{n}(X)$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q}$ given in \cite{Graner}. As a consequence, we classify the cyclic codes over finite fields via giving their generator polynomials. Moreover, the self-dual cyclic codes are determined and enumerated.</p></details> | 28 pages |

Current research is hindered by redundant generation results and a tendency to overfit local patterns in the short term. Although existing studies attempt to alleviate the issue by adopting a multi-token prediction strategy, there remains limited focus on choosing the appropriate processing length for generations. By analyzing the attention between tokens during the generation process of LLMs, it can be observed that the high spikes of the attention scores typically appear at the end of lines. This insight suggests that it is reasonable to treat each line of code as a fundamental processing unit and generate them sequentially. Inspired by this, we propose the \textbf{LSR-MCTS} algorithm, which leverages MCTS to determine the code line-by-line and select the optimal path. Further, we integrate a self-refine mechanism at each node to enhance diversity and generate higher-quality programs through error correction. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analyses on three public coding benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art performance approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeFlowBench: A Multi-turn, Iterative Benchmark for Complex Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21751v2)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software development demands code that is maintainable, testable, and scalable by organizing the implementation into modular components with iterative reuse of existing codes. We formalize this iterative, multi-turn paradigm as codeflow and introduce CodeFlowBench, the first benchmark designed to comprehensively evaluate LLMs' ability to perform codeflow, namely implementing new functionality by reusing existing functions over multiple turns. CodeFlowBench comprises 5,258 problems from Codeforces and is continuously updated via an automated pipeline, which decomposes each problem into subproblems with unit tests based on dependency tree analysis and dataflow analysis. We further propose a novel evaluation framework featured dual assessment protocol and structural metrics derived from dependency trees. Extensive experiments on 16 popular LLMs reveal significant performance degradation in multi-turn scenarios. For instance, o1-mini retains only 20.8% Pass@1 in multi-turn scenario versus 37.8% in single-turn scenario. More fine-grained analysis illustrates that model performance inversely correlates with dependency complexity. These findings not only highlight the critical challenges for supporting real-world workflows, but also establish CodeFlowBench as an essential tool for advancing code generation research.</p></details> |  |

However, these systems often overlook a critical dimension in real-world software development: \textit{maintainability}. To handle dynamic requirements with minimal rework, we propose \textbf{MaintainCoder} as a pioneering solution. It integrates the Waterfall model, design patterns, and multi-agent collaboration to systematically enhance cohesion, reduce coupling, achieving clear responsibility boundaries and better maintainability. We also introduce \textbf{MaintainBench}, a benchmark comprising requirement changes and novel dynamic metrics on maintenance efforts. Experiments demonstrate that existing code generation methods struggle to meet maintainability standards when requirements evolve. In contrast, MaintainCoder improves dynamic maintainability metrics by more than 60\% with even higher correctness of initial codes. Furthermore, while static metrics fail to accurately reflect maintainability and even contradict each other, our proposed dynamic metrics exhibit high consistency. Our work not only provides the foundation for maintainable code generation, but also highlights the need for more realistic and comprehensive code generation research.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://github.com/IAAR-Shanghai/MaintainCoder</p></details> |

However, there is an unignorable programming language bias in existing code benchmarks -- over 95% code generation benchmarks are dominated by Python, leaving the LLMs' capabilities in other programming languages such as Java and C/C++ unknown. Moreover, coding task bias is also crucial. Most benchmarks focus on code generation capability, while benchmarks for code reasoning (given input, reasoning output; and given output, reasoning input), an essential coding capability, are insufficient. Yet, constructing multi-lingual benchmarks can be expensive and labor-intensive, and codes in contest websites such as Leetcode suffer from data contamination during training. To fill this gap, we propose CRUXEVAL-X, a multi-lingual code reasoning benchmark that contains 19 programming languages. It comprises at least 600 subjects for each language, along with 19K content-consistent tests in total. In particular, the construction pipeline of CRUXEVAL-X works in a fully automated and test-guided manner, which iteratively generates and repairs based on execution feedback. Also, to cross language barriers (e.g., dynamic/static type systems in Python/C++), we formulated various transition rules between language pairs to facilitate translation. Our intensive evaluation of 24 representative LLMs reveals the correlation between language pairs. For example, TypeScript and JavaScript show a significant positive correlation, while Racket has less correlation with other languages. More interestingly, even a model trained solely on Python can achieve at most 34.4% Pass@1 in other languages, revealing the cross-language generalization of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>18pag...</summary><p>18pages, Accepted to ACL 2025 Main Conference</p></details> |
| **[Defending Code Language Models against Backdoor Attacks with Deceptive Cross-Entropy Loss](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08956v3)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code Language Models (CLMs), particularly those leveraging deep learning, have achieved significant success in code intelligence domain. However, the issue of security, particularly backdoor attacks, is often overlooked in this process. The previous research has focused on designing backdoor attacks for CLMs, but effective defenses have not been adequately addressed. In particular, existing defense methods from natural language processing, when directly applied to CLMs, are not effective enough and lack generality, working well in some models and scenarios but failing in others, thus fall short in consistently mitigating backdoor attacks. To bridge this gap, we first confirm the phenomenon of "early learning" as a general occurrence during the training of CLMs. This phenomenon refers to that a model initially focuses on the main features of training data but may become more sensitive to backdoor triggers over time, leading to overfitting and susceptibility to backdoor attacks. We then analyze that overfitting to backdoor triggers results from the use of the cross-entropy loss function, where the unboundedness of cross-entropy leads the model to increasingly concentrate on the features of the poisoned data. Based on this insight, we propose a general and effective loss function DeCE (Deceptive Cross-Entropy) by blending deceptive distributions and applying label smoothing to limit the gradient to bounded, which prevents the model from overfitting to backdoor triggers and then enhances the security of CLMs against backdoor attacks.</p></details> | TOSEM |

This work investigates whether LLMs can optimize the performance of assembly code, where fine-grained control over execution enables improvements that are difficult to express in high-level languages. We present a reinforcement learning framework that trains LLMs using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), guided by a reward function that considers both functional correctness, validated through test cases, and execution performance relative to the industry-standard compiler gcc -O3. To support this study, we introduce a benchmark of 8,072 real-world programs. Our model, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-PPO, achieves 96.0% test pass rates and an average speedup of 1.47x over the gcc -O3 baseline, outperforming all 20 other models evaluated, including Claude-3.7-sonnet. These results indicate that reinforcement learning can unlock the potential of LLMs to serve as effective optimizers for assembly code performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Compression Really Linear with Code Intelligence?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11441v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the relationship between data compression and the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial, especially in specialized domains like code intelligence. Prior work posited a linear relationship between compression and general intelligence. However, it overlooked the multifaceted nature of code that encompasses diverse programming languages and tasks, and struggled with fair evaluation of modern Code LLMs. We address this by evaluating a diverse array of open-source Code LLMs on comprehensive multi-language, multi-task code benchmarks. To address the challenge of efficient and fair evaluation of pre-trained LLMs' code intelligence, we introduce \textit{Format Annealing}, a lightweight, transparent training methodology designed to assess the intrinsic capabilities of these pre-trained models equitably. Compression efficacy, measured as bits-per-character (BPC), is determined using a novel, large-scale, and previously unseen code validation set derived from GitHub. Our empirical results reveal a fundamental logarithmic relationship between measured code intelligence and BPC. This finding refines prior hypotheses of linearity, which we suggest are likely observations of the logarithmic curve's tail under specific, limited conditions. Our work provides a more nuanced understanding of compression's role in developing code intelligence and contributes a robust evaluation framework in the code domain.</p></details> | work in progress |

Their strong error-correcting abilities and efficient encoding and decoding methods make BCH codes widely applicable in various areas, including communication systems, data storage devices, and consumer electronics. Although BCH codes have been extensively studied, the parameters of BCH codes are not known in general. Let $q$ be a prime power and $m$ be a positive integer. Denote by $\mathcal{C}_{(q,m,\delta)}$ the narrow-sense primitive BCH code with length $q^m-1$ and designed distance $\delta$. As of now, the dimensions of $\mathcal{C}_{(q,m,\delta)}$ are fully understood only for $m \leq 2$. For $m \geq 4$, the dimensions of $\mathcal{C}_{(q,m,\delta)}$ are known only for the range $2 \leq \delta \leq q^{\lfloor (m+1)/2 \rfloor +1}$ and for a limited number of special cases. In this paper, we determined the dimension and Bose distance of $\mathcal{C}_{(q,m,\delta)}$ for $m\geq 4$ and $\delta\in [2, q^{\lfloor ( 2m-1)/{3}\rfloor+1}]. $ Additionally, we have also extended our results to primitive BCH codes that are not necessarily narrow-sense.</p></details> |  |

A scheme that has demonstrated promising results for small code instances that are realizable on currently available hardware composes a non-fault-tolerant state preparation step with a verification step that checks for spreading errors. Known circuit constructions of this scheme are mostly obtained manually, and no algorithmic techniques for constructing depth- or gate-optimal circuits exist. As a consequence, the current state of the art exploits this scheme only for specific code instances and mostly for the special case of distance 3 codes. In this work, we propose an automated approach for synthesizing fault-tolerant state preparation circuits for arbitrary CSS codes. We utilize methods based on satisfiability solving (SAT) techniques to construct fault-tolerant state preparation circuits consisting of depth- and gate-optimal preparation and verification circuits. We also provide heuristics that can synthesize fault-tolerant state preparation circuits for code instances where no optimal solution can be obtained in an adequate timeframe. Moreover, we give a general construction for non-deterministic state preparation circuits beyond distance 3. Numerical evaluations using $d=3$ and $d=5$ codes confirm that the generated circuits exhibit the desired scaling of the logical error rates. The resulting methods are publicly available as part of the Munich Quantum Toolkit (MQT) at https://github.com/cda-tum/mqt-qecc. Such methods are an important step in providing fault-tolerant circuit constructions that can aid in near-term demonstration of fault-tolerant quantum computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 21 figures Version 2: included some references, fixed error in printed circuits Version 3: journal publication update, extended evaluations</p></details> |
| **[New Wide Locally Recoverable Codes with Unified Locality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06819v2)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Wide Locally Recoverable Codes (LRCs) have recently been proposed as a solution for achieving high reliability, good performance, and ultra-low storage cost in distributed storage systems. However, existing wide LRCs struggle to balance optimal fault tolerance and high availability during frequent system events. By analyzing the existing LRCs, we reveal three limitations in the LRC construction which lay behind the non-optimal overall performance from multiple perspectives, including non-minimum local recovery cost, non cluster-topology-aware data distribution, and non XOR-based local coding. Thanks to the flexible design space offered by the locality property of wide LRCs, we present UniLRC, which unifies locality considerations in code construction. UniLRC achieves the optimal fault tolerance while overcoming the revealed limitations. We implement UniLRC prototype and conduct comprehensive theoretical and system evaluations, showing significant improvements in reliability and performance over existing wide LRCs deployed in Google and Azure clusters.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code-Driven Planning in Grid Worlds with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10749v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an iterative programmatic planning (IPP) framework for solving grid-based tasks by synthesizing interpretable agent policies expressed in code using large language models (LLMs). Instead of relying on traditional search or reinforcement learning, our approach uses code generation as policy synthesis, where the LLM outputs executable programs that map environment states to action sequences. Our proposed architecture incorporates several prompting strategies, including direct code generation, pseudocode-conditioned refinement, and curriculum-based prompting, but also includes an iterative refinement mechanism that updates code based on task performance feedback. We evaluate our approach using six leading LLMs and two challenging grid-based benchmarks (GRASP and MiniGrid). Our IPP framework demonstrates improvements over direct code generation ranging from 10\% to as much as 10x across five of the six models and establishes a new state-of-the-art result for GRASP. IPP is found to significantly outperform direct elicitation of a solution from GPT-o3-mini (by 63\% on MiniGrid to 116\% on GRASP), demonstrating the viability of the overall approach. Computational costs of all code generation approaches are similar. While code generation has a higher initial prompting cost compared to direct solution elicitation (\$0.08 per task vs. \$0.002 per instance for GPT-o3-mini), the code can be reused for any number of instances, making the amortized cost significantly lower (by 400x on GPT-o3-mini across the complete GRASP benchmark).</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Current Language Models Support Code Intelligence for R Programming Language?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07793v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in developing Pre-trained Language Models for Code (Code-PLMs) have urged many areas of Software Engineering (SE) and brought breakthrough results for many SE tasks. Though these models have achieved the state-of-the-art performance for SE tasks for many popular programming languages, such as Java and Python, the Scientific Software and its related languages like R programming language have rarely benefited or even been evaluated with the Code-PLMs. Research has shown that R has many differences with other programming languages and requires specific techniques. In this study, we provide the first insights for code intelligence for R. For this purpose, we collect and open source an R dataset, and evaluate Code-PLMs for the two tasks of code summarization and method name prediction using several settings and strategies, including the differences in two R styles, Tidy-verse and Base R. Our results demonstrate that the studied models have experienced varying degrees of performance degradation when processing R programming language code, which is supported by human evaluation. Additionally, not all models show performance improvement in R-specific tasks even after multi-language fine-tuning. The dual syntax paradigms in R significantly impact the models' performance, particularly in code summarization tasks. Furthermore, the project-specific context inherent in R codebases significantly impacts the performance when attempting cross-project training.</p></details> |  |

While prior research has focused on detecting IaC issues, Automated Program Repair (APR) remains underexplored, largely due to the lack of suitable specifications. In this work, we propose InfraFix, the first technology-agnostic framework for repairing IaC scripts. Unlike prior approaches, InfraFix allows APR techniques to be guided by diverse information sources. Additionally, we introduce a novel approach for generating repair scenarios, enabling large-scale evaluation of APR techniques for IaC. We implement and evaluate InfraFix using an SMT-based repair module and a state inference module that uses system calls, demonstrating its effectiveness across 254,288 repair scenarios with a success rate of 95.7%. Our work provides a foundation for advancing APR in IaC by enabling researchers to experiment with new state inference and repair techniques using InfraFix and to evaluate their approaches at scale with our repair scenario generation method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ISSTA 2025</p></details> |

To this end, we propose leveraging code as supervision for cross-modal alignment, since code inherently encodes all information needed to generate corresponding figures, establishing a precise connection between the two modalities. Specifically, we co-develop our image-to-code model and dataset with model-in-the-loop approach, resulting in an image-to-code model, FigCodifier and ImgCode-8.6M dataset, the largest image-code dataset to date. Furthermore, we utilize FigCodifier to synthesize novel mathematical figures and then construct MM-MathInstruct-3M, a high-quality multimodal math instruction fine-tuning dataset. Finally, we present MathCoder-VL, trained with ImgCode-8.6M for cross-modal alignment and subsequently fine-tuned on MM-MathInstruct-3M for multimodal math problem solving. Our model achieves a new open-source SOTA across all six metrics. Notably, it surpasses GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet in the geometry problem-solving subset of MathVista, achieving improvements of 8.9% and 9.2%.

Evaluating Large Language Models from a Code Security Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10494v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code security and usability are both essential for various coding assistant applications driven by large language models (LLMs). Current code security benchmarks focus solely on single evaluation task and paradigm, such as code completion and generation, lacking comprehensive assessment across dimensions like secure code generation, vulnerability repair and discrimination. In this paper, we first propose CoV-Eval, a multi-task benchmark covering various tasks such as code completion, vulnerability repair, vulnerability detection and classification, for comprehensive evaluation of LLM code security. Besides, we developed VC-Judge, an improved judgment model that aligns closely with human experts and can review LLM-generated programs for vulnerabilities in a more efficient and reliable way. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of 20 proprietary and open-source LLMs. Overall, while most LLMs identify vulnerable codes well, they still tend to generate insecure codes and struggle with recognizing specific vulnerability types and performing repairs. Extensive experiments and qualitative analyses reveal key challenges and optimization directions, offering insights for future research in LLM code security.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACL2025 Main Conference</p></details> |

While large language models (LLMs) have shown significant progress in generating general 3D scenes from textual descriptions, generating industrial scenes with LLMs poses a unique challenge due to their demand for precise measurements and positioning, requiring complex planning over spatial arrangement. To address this challenge, we introduce SceneGenAgent, an LLM-based agent for generating industrial scenes through C# code. SceneGenAgent ensures precise layout planning through a structured and calculable format, layout verification, and iterative refinement to meet the quantitative requirements of industrial scenarios. Experiment results demonstrate that LLMs powered by SceneGenAgent exceed their original performance, reaching up to 81.0% success rate in real-world industrial scene generation tasks and effectively meeting most scene generation requirements. To further enhance accessibility, we construct SceneInstruct, a dataset designed for fine-tuning open-source LLMs to integrate into SceneGenAgent. Experiments show that fine-tuning open-source LLMs on SceneInstruct yields significant performance improvements, with Llama3.1-70B approaching the capabilities of GPT-4o. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/THUDM/SceneGenAgent .</p></details> |  |
| **[Unified Modeling Language Code Generation from Diagram Images Using Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12293v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Unified Modeling Language is a standardized visual language widely used for modeling and documenting the design of software systems. Although many tools generate UML diagrams from UML code, generating executable UML code from image-based UML diagrams remains challenging. This paper proposes a new approach to generate UML code using a large multimodal language model automatically. Synthetic UML activity and sequence diagram datasets were created to train and test the model. We compared standard fine-tuning with LoRA techniques to optimize base models. The experiments measured code generation accuracy across different model sizes and training strategies. These results demonstrated that domain-adapted MM-LLMs perform for UML code generation automation, whereby, at the best model, it achieved BLEU and SSIM scores of 0.779 and 0.942 on sequence diagrams. This will enable the modernization of legacy systems and decrease the manual effort in software development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Journal of Machine Learning with Applications, Author Contributions: Averi Bates: Methodology, Development, Analysis, Data Curation, Drafting, Review.

| **[Are Large Language Models Robust in Understanding Code Against Semantics-Preserving Mutations?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10443v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the reasoning and robustness of Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for their reliable use in programming tasks. While recent studies have assessed LLMs' ability to predict program outputs, most focus solely on the accuracy of those predictions, without evaluating the reasoning behind them. Moreover, it has been observed on mathematical reasoning tasks that LLMs can arrive at correct answers through flawed logic, raising concerns about similar issues in code understanding. In this work, we evaluate whether state-of-the-art LLMs with up to 8B parameters can reason about Python programs or are simply guessing. We apply five semantics-preserving code mutations: renaming variables, mirroring comparison expressions, swapping if-else branches, converting for loops to while, and loop unrolling. These mutations maintain program semantics while altering its syntax. We evaluated six LLMs and performed a human expert analysis using LiveCodeBench to assess whether the correct predictions are based on sound reasoning. We also evaluated prediction stability across different code mutations on LiveCodeBench and CruxEval. Our findings show that some LLMs, such as Llama3.2, produce correct predictions based on flawed reasoning in up to 61% of cases. Furthermore, LLMs often change predictions in response to our code mutations, indicating limited robustness in their semantic understanding.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Repetition Problems of LLMs in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10402v1)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advent of neural language models, the performance of code generation has been significantly boosted. However, the problem of repetitions during the generation process continues to linger. Previous work has primarily focused on content repetition, which is merely a fraction of the broader repetition problem in code generation. A more prevalent and challenging problem is structural repetition. In structural repetition, the repeated code appears in various patterns but possesses a fixed structure, which can be inherently reflected in grammar. In this paper, we formally define structural repetition and propose an efficient decoding approach called RPG, which stands for Repetition Penalization based on Grammar, to alleviate the repetition problems in code generation for LLMs. Specifically, RPG first leverages grammar rules to identify repetition problems during code generation, and then strategically decays the likelihood of critical tokens that contribute to repetitions, thereby mitigating them in code generation. To facilitate this study, we construct a new dataset CodeRepetEval to comprehensively evaluate approaches for mitigating the repetition problems in code generation. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that RPG substantially outperforms the best-performing baselines on CodeRepetEval dataset as well as HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks, effectively reducing repetitions and enhancing the quality of generated code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (main)</p></details> |

Although solar cells offer the advantage of simultaneous energy harvesting and data reception, their broadband nature hinders accurate decoding of color-coded signals like Color Shift Keying (CSK). In this paper, we propose a novel approach exploiting the concept of tandem solar cells, multi-layer devices with partial wavelength selectivity, to capture coarse color information without resorting to energy-limiting color filters. To address the residual spectral overlap, we develop a bidirectional LSTM-based machine learning framework that infers channel characteristics by comparing solar cells' photovoltaic signals with pilot-based anchor data. Our commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) solar prototype achieves robust performance across varying distances and ambient lighting levels, significantly reducing bit error rates compared to conventional channel estimation methods. These findings mark a step toward sustainable, high-performance VLC systems powered by the multi-layer solar technologies.</p></details> | 14 pages, 25 figures |

Fine-tuning approaches proposed in the literature for LLMs on program repair tasks generally overlook the need to reason about the logic behind code changes, beyond syntactic patterns in the data. High-performing fine-tuning experiments also usually come at very high computational costs. With MORepair, we propose a novel perspective on the learning focus of LLM fine-tuning for program repair: we not only adapt the LLM parameters to the syntactic nuances of the task of code transformation (objective 1), but we also specifically fine-tune the LLM with respect to the logical reason behind the code change in the training data (objective 2). Such a multi-objective fine-tuning will instruct LLMs to generate high-quality patches. We apply MORepair to fine-tune four open-source LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Experimental results on function-level and repository-level repair benchmarks show that the implemented fine-tuning effectively boosts LLM repair performance by 11.4% to 56.0%. We further show that our fine-tuning strategy yields superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, including standard fine-tuning, Fine-tune-CoT, and RepairLLaMA.</p></details> |  |

Building upon existing system-1 models, CRPE addresses the fundamental challenge of enhancing LLMs' analytical and logical processing in code generation tasks. Our framework presents a methodologically rigorous yet implementable approach to cultivating advanced code reasoning abilities in language models. Through the implementation of CRPE, we successfully develop an enhanced COT-Coder that demonstrates marked improvements in code generation tasks. Evaluation results on LiveCodeBench (20240701-20240901) demonstrate that our COT-Coder-7B-StepDPO, derived from Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Base, with a pass@1 accuracy of 21.88, exceeds all models with similar or even larger sizes. Furthermore, our COT-Coder-32B-StepDPO, based on Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Base, exhibits superior performance with a pass@1 accuracy of 35.08, outperforming GPT4O on the benchmark. Overall, CRPE represents a comprehensive, open-source method that encompasses the complete pipeline from instruction data acquisition through expert code reasoning data synthesis, culminating in an autonomous reasoning enhancement mechanism.</p></details> |  |

We show that $ J$-affine variety codes are well suited for such products, generalizing earlier results for cyclic, Reed-Muller, hyperbolic, and toric codes. Using this correspondence, we construct CSS-T quantum codes from weighted Reed-Muller codes and from binary subfield-subcodes of $ J$-affine variety codes, leading to codes with better parameters than previously known. Finally, we present Private Information Retrieval (PIR) constructions for multiple colluding servers based on hyperbolic codes and subfield-subcodes of $ J$-affine variety codes, and show that they outperform existing PIR schemes.</p></details> |  |

This has thus caused a spotlight to be paced on these resources, where researchers have reported mixed outcomes around the quality of these resources. Stack Overflow, in particular, has been studied extensively, with evidence showing that code resources on this platform can be of poor quality at times. Limited research has explored the variables or factors that predict code quality on Stack Overflow, but instead has focused on ranking content, identifying defects and predicting future content. In many instances approaches used for prediction are not evaluated to identify the best techniques. Contextualizing the Stack Overflow code quality problem as regression-based, we examined the variables that predict Stack Overflow (Java) code quality, and the regression approach that provides the best predictive power. Six approaches were considered in our evaluation, where Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM) stood out. In addition, longer Stack Overflow code tended to have more code violations, questions that were scored higher also attracted more views and the more answers that are added to questions on Stack Overflow the more errors were typically observed in the code that was provided. Outcomes here point to the value of the GBM ensemble learning mechanism, and the need for the practitioner community to be prudent when contributing and reusing Stack Overflow Java coding resource.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Either OSD or the $A^*$ decoding utilizes the magnitudes of the received symbols to establish the most reliable and independent positions (MRIP) frame. A restricted searched space can be employed to achieve near-optimum decoding with reduced decoding complexity. For a low-rate code with large minimum distance, the restricted search space is still very huge. We propose to use concatenated coding to further restrict the search space by proposing an improved MRIP frame. The improved MRIP frame is founded according to magnitudes of log likelihood ratios (LLRs) obtained by the soft-in soft-out (SISO) decoder for the inner code. We focus on the construction and decoding of several $(n,k)$ = (128,36) binary linear block codes based on concatenated coding. We use the (128,36) extended BCH (eBCH) code as a benchmark for comparison. Simulation shows that there exist constructed concatenated codes which are much more efficient than the (128,36) eBCH code. Some other codes of length 128 or close to 128 are also constructed to demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed scheme.</p></details> |  |

As such, we introduce TransPL, a novel approach that addresses these limitations by modeling the joint distribution $P(\mathbf{X}, y)$ of the source domain through code transition matrices, where the codes are derived from vector quantization (VQ) of time series patches. Our method constructs class- and channel-wise code transition matrices from the source domain and employs Bayes' rule for target domain adaptation, generating pseudo-labels based on channel-wise weighted class-conditional likelihoods. TransPL offers three key advantages: explicit modeling of temporal transitions and channel-wise shifts between different domains, versatility towards different UDA scenarios (e.g., weakly-supervised UDA), and explainable pseudo-label generation. We validate TransPL's effectiveness through extensive analysis on four time series UDA benchmarks and confirm that it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art pseudo-labeling methods by a strong margin (6.1% accuracy improvement, 4.9% F1 improvement), while providing interpretable insights into the domain adaptation process through its learned code transition matrices.</p></details> | ICML 2025 Accept |
| **[Compact Lattice-Coded (Multi-Recipient) Kyber without CLT Independence Assumption](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17185v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a joint design of encoding and encryption procedures for public key encryptions (PKEs) and key encapsulation mechanism (KEMs) such as Kyber, without relying on the assumption of independent decoding noise components, achieving reductions in both communication overhead (CER) and decryption failure rate (DFR). Our design features two techniques: ciphertext packing and lattice packing. First, we extend the Peikert-Vaikuntanathan-Waters (PVW) method to Kyber: $\ell$ plaintexts are packed into a single ciphertext. This scheme is referred to as P$_\ell$-Kyber. We prove that the P$_\ell$-Kyber is IND-CCA secure under the M-LWE hardness assumption. We show that the decryption decoding noise entries across the $\ell$ plaintexts (also known as layers) are mutually independent. Second, we propose a cross-layer lattice encoding scheme for the P$_\ell$-Kyber, where every $\ell$ cross-layer information symbols are encoded to a lattice point. This way we obtain a \emph{coded} P$_\ell$-Kyber, where the decoding noise entries for each lattice point are mutually independent. Therefore, the DFR analysis does not require the assumption of independence among the decryption decoding noise entries. Both DFR and CER are greatly decreased thanks to ciphertext packing and lattice packing. We demonstrate that with $\ell=24$ and Leech lattice encoder, the proposed coded P$_\ell$-KYBER1024 achieves DFR $<2^{-281}$ and CER $ = 4.6$, i.e., a decrease of CER by $90\%$ compared to KYBER1024.</p></details> | 8 Tables, 3 Figures |

Recently, the rapid development of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) has made it possible to generate front-end Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) code directly from webpage designs. However, real-world webpages encompass not only a diverse array of HTML tags but also complex stylesheets, resulting in significantly lengthy code. The lengthy code poses challenges for the performance and efficiency of MLLMs, especially in capturing the structural information of UI designs. To address these challenges, this paper proposes UICopilot, a novel approach to automating UI synthesis via hierarchical code generation from webpage designs. The core idea of UICopilot is to decompose the generation process into two stages: first, generating the coarse-grained HTML hierarchical structure, followed by the generation of fine-grained code. To validate the effectiveness of UICopilot, we conduct experiments on a real-world dataset, i.e., WebCode2M. Experimental results demonstrate that UICopilot significantly outperforms existing baselines in both automatic evaluation metrics and human evaluations. Specifically, statistical analysis reveals that the majority of human annotators prefer the webpages generated by UICopilot over those produced by GPT-4V.</p></details> | WWW' 2025 |

We demonstrate that several parameter families of such codes necessarily arise from binary or ternary Hamming graphs or do not exist. Furthermore, employing binary linear programming techniques, we explore completely regular codes in infinite grids of dimensions 3 and 4 for the cases r=1 and r=2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Toward Universal Decoding of Binary Linear Block Codes via Enhanced Polar Transformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.07279v2)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary linear block codes (BLBCs) are essential to modern communication, but their diverse structures often require tailor-made decoders, increasing complexity. This work introduces enhanced polar decoding ($\mathsf{PD}^+$), a universal soft decoding algorithm that transforms any BLBC into a polar-like code compatible with efficient polar code decoders such as successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding. Key innovations in $\mathsf{PD}^+$ include pruning polar kernels, shortening codes, and leveraging a simulated annealing algorithm to optimize transformations. These enable $\mathsf{PD}^+$ to achieve competitive or superior performance to state-of-the-art algorithms like OSD and GRAND across various codes, including extended BCH, extended Golay, and binary quadratic residue codes, with significantly lower complexity. Moreover, $\mathsf{PD}^+$ is designed to be forward-compatible with advancements in polar code decoding techniques and AI-driven search methods, making it a robust and versatile solution for universal BLBC decoding in both present and future systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coded Downlink Massive Random Access and a Finite de Finetti Theorem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08301v4)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers a massive connectivity setting in which a base-station (BS) aims to communicate sources $(X_1,\cdots,X_k)$ to a randomly activated subset of $k$ users, among a large pool of $n$ users, via a common message in the downlink. Although the identities of the $k$ active users are assumed to be known at the BS, each active user only knows whether itself is active and does not know the identities of the other active users. A naive coding strategy is to transmit the sources alongside the identities of the users for which the source information is intended. This requires $H(X_1,\cdots,X_k) + k\log(n)$ bits, because the cost of specifying the identity of one out of $n$ users is $\log(n)$ bits. For large $n$, this overhead can be significant. This paper shows that it is possible to develop coding techniques that eliminate the dependency of the overhead on $n$, if the source distribution follows certain symmetry. Specifically, if the source distribution is independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) then the overhead can be reduced to at most $O(\log(k))$ bits, and in case of uniform i.i.d. sources, the overhead can be further reduced to $O(1)$ bits. For sources that follow a more general exchangeable distribution, the overhead is at most $O(k)$ bits, and in case of finite-alphabet exchangeable sources, the overhead can be further reduced to $O(\log(k))$ bits. The downlink massive random access problem is closely connected to the study of finite exchangeable sequences. The proposed coding strategy allows bounds on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between finite exchangeable distributions and i.i.d. mixture distributions to be developed and gives a new KL divergence version of the finite de Finetti theorem, which is scaling optimal.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 Pa...</summary><p>18 Pages.

By focusing on a well-defined family of functions, function-correcting codes can be constructed with minimal length while still ensuring full error detection or correction within that family. In this paper, we explore locally ($\lambda,\rho$)-functions and develop function-correcting codes using these functions for $b$-symbol read channels. We establish the recurrence relation between the optimal redundancy of $(f,t)$ -function-correcting codes for the $(b+1)$-read and $b$-read channels. We establish an upper bound on the redundancy of general locally ($\lambda,\rho$, $b$)-function-correcting codes by linking it to the minimum achievable length of $b$-symbol error-correcting codes and traditional Hamming-metric codes, given a fixed number of codewords and a specified minimum distance. Specifically, we present explicit upper bounds for the classes of ($4,2t,b$)-local functions and ($2^b,2t,b$)-local functions. Additionally, for the case where $b=1$, we show that a ($3,2t,1$)-local function achieves the optimal redundancy of $3t$ under certain conditions. Moreover, we explicitly investigate locality and redundancy for the weight distribution function.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synchronization of strongly connected partial DFAs and prefix codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2101.05057v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study synchronizing partial DFAs, which extend the classical concept of synchronizing complete DFAs and are a special case of synchronizing unambiguous NFAs. A partial DFA is called synchronizing if it has a word (called a \emph{reset word}) whose action brings a non-empty subset of states to a unique state and is undefined for all other states. The class of strongly connected partial automata is precisely the class of automata recognized prefix codes. While in the general case the problem of checking whether a partial DFA is synchronizing is PSPACE-complete, we show that in the strongly connected case this problem can be efficiently reduced to the same problem for a complete DFA. Using combinatorial, algebraic, and formal languages methods, we develop techniques that relate main synchronization problems for strongly connected partial DFAs to the same problems for complete DFAs. In particular, this includes the \v{C}ern\'{y} and the rank conjectures, the problem of finding a reset word, and upper bounds on the length of the shortest reset words of literal automata of finite prefix codes. We conclude that solving fundamental synchronization problems is equally hard in both models, as an essential improvement of the results for one model implies an improvement for the other.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of the paper at STACS 2021</p></details> |
| **[Comparing Quantum Annealing and Spiking Neuromorphic Computing for Sampling Binary Sparse Coding QUBO Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20525v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of computing a sparse binary representation of an image. To be precise, given an image and an overcomplete, non-orthonormal basis, we aim to find a sparse binary vector indicating the minimal set of basis vectors that when added together best reconstruct the given input. We formulate this problem with an $L_2$ loss on the reconstruction error, and an $L_0$ (or, equivalently, an $L_1$) loss on the binary vector enforcing sparsity. This yields a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization problem (QUBO), whose optimal solution(s) in general is NP-hard to find. The contribution of this work is twofold. First, we solve the sparse representation QUBOs by solving them both on a D-Wave quantum annealer with Pegasus chip connectivity via minor embedding, as well as on the Intel Loihi 2 spiking neuromorphic processor using a stochastic Non-equilibrium Boltzmann Machine (NEBM). Second, we deploy Quantum Evolution Monte Carlo with Reverse Annealing and iterated warm starting on Loihi 2 to evolve the solution quality from the respective machines. The solutions are benchmarked against simulated annealing, a classical heuristic, and the optimal solutions are computed using CPLEX. Iterated reverse quantum annealing performs similarly to simulated annealing, although simulated annealing is always able to sample the optimal solution whereas quantum annealing was not always able to. The Loihi 2 solutions that are sampled are on average more sparse than the solutions from any of the other methods. We demonstrate that both quantum annealing and neuromorphic computing are suitable for binary sparse coding QUBOs, and that Loihi 2 outperforms a D-Wave quantum annealer standard linear-schedule anneal, while iterated reverse quantum annealing performs much better than both unmodified linear-schedule quantum annealing and iterated warm starting on Loihi 2.</p></details> |  |
| **[Agent RL Scaling Law: Agent RL with Spontaneous Code Execution for Mathematical Problem Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07773v2)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with mathematical reasoning tasks requiring precise, verifiable computation. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) from outcome-based rewards enhances text-based reasoning, understanding how agents autonomously learn to leverage external tools like code execution remains crucial. We investigate RL from outcome-based rewards for Tool-Integrated Reasoning, ZeroTIR, training base LLMs to spontaneously generate and execute Python code for mathematical problems without supervised tool-use examples. Our central contribution is we demonstrate that as RL training progresses, key metrics scale predictably. Specifically, we observe strong positive correlations where increased training steps lead to increases in the spontaneous code execution frequency, the average response length, and, critically, the final task accuracy. This suggests a quantifiable relationship between computational effort invested in training and the emergence of effective, tool-augmented reasoning strategies. We implement a robust framework featuring a decoupled code execution environment and validate our findings across standard RL algorithms and frameworks. Experiments show ZeroTIR significantly surpasses non-tool ZeroRL baselines on challenging math benchmarks. Our findings provide a foundational understanding of how autonomous tool use is acquired and scales within Agent RL, offering a reproducible benchmark for future studies.

| **[Variational Prefix Tuning for Diverse and Accurate Code Summarization Using Pre-trained Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.09062v1)** | 2025-05-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in source code summarization have leveraged transformer-based pre-trained models, including Large Language Models of Code (LLMCs), to automate and improve the generation of code summaries. However, existing methods often focus on generating a single high-quality summary for a given source code, neglecting scenarios where the generated summary might be inadequate and alternative options are needed. In this paper, we introduce Variational Prefix Tuning (VPT), a novel approach that enhances pre-trained models' ability to generate diverse yet accurate sets of summaries, allowing the user to choose the most suitable one for the given source code. Our method integrates a Conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE) framework as a modular component into pre-trained models, enabling us to model the distribution of observed target summaries and sample continuous embeddings to be used as prefixes to steer the generation of diverse outputs during decoding. Importantly, we construct our method in a parameter-efficient manner, eliminating the need for expensive model retraining, especially when using LLMCs. Furthermore, we employ a bi-criteria reranking method to select a subset of generated summaries, optimizing both the diversity and the accuracy of the options presented to users. We present extensive experimental evaluations using widely used datasets and current state-of-the-art pre-trained code summarization models to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach and its adaptability across models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Journal of Systems and Software</p></details> |

| **[EquiBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models' Understanding of Program Semantics via Equivalence Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12466v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become integral to code-related tasks, a central question emerges: do LLMs truly understand program execution semantics? We introduce EquiBench, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs through equivalence checking, i.e., determining whether two programs produce identical outputs for all possible inputs. Unlike prior code generation benchmarks, this task directly tests a model's understanding of code execution semantics. EquiBench consists of 2400 program pairs across four languages and six categories. These pairs are generated through program analysis, compiler scheduling, and superoptimization, ensuring high-confidence labels, nontrivial difficulty, and full automation. The transformations span syntactic edits, structural modifications, and algorithmic changes, covering a broad spectrum of semantic variation. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art LLMs and find that in the most challenging categories, the best accuracies are 63.8% and 76.2%, only modestly above the 50% random baseline. Further analysis reveals that models often rely on syntactic similarity rather than exhibiting robust reasoning over execution semantics, highlighting fundamental limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cassandra: Efficient Enforcement of Sequential Execution for Cryptographic Programs (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04290v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constant-time programming is a widely deployed approach to harden cryptographic programs against side channel attacks. However, modern processors often violate the underlying assumptions of standard constant-time policies by transiently executing unintended paths of the program. Despite many solutions proposed, addressing control flow misspeculations in an efficient way without losing performance is an open problem. In this work, we propose Cassandra, a novel hardware/software mechanism to enforce sequential execution for constant-time cryptographic code in a highly efficient manner. Cassandra explores the radical design point of disabling the branch predictor and recording-and-replaying sequential control flow of the program. Two key insights that enable our design are that (1) the sequential control flow of a constant-time program is mostly static over different runs, and (2) cryptographic programs are loop-intensive and their control flow patterns repeat in a highly compressible way. These insights allow us to perform an upfront branch analysis that significantly compresses control flow traces. We add a small component to a typical processor design, the Branch Trace Unit, to store compressed traces and determine fetch redirections according to the sequential model of the program. Despite providing a strong security guarantee, Cassandra counterintuitively provides an average 1.85% speedup compared to an unsafe baseline processor, mainly due to enforcing near-perfect fetch redirections.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables, 1 listing</p></details> |
| **[Verifying Tree-Manipulating Programs via CHCs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14092v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Programs that manipulate tree-shaped data structures often require complex, specialized proofs that are difficult to generalize and automate. This paper introduces a unified, foundational approach to verifying such programs. Central to our approach is the knitted-tree encoding, modeling each program execution as a tree structure capturing input, output, and intermediate states. Leveraging the compositional nature of knitted-trees, we encode these structures as constrained Horn clauses (CHCs), reducing verification to CHC satisfiability task. To illustrate our approach, we focus on memory safety and show how it naturally leads to simple, modular invariants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fixing 7,400 Bugs for 1$: Cheap Crash-Site Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13103v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of bug-finding techniques has led to the discovery of more vulnerabilities than developers can reasonably fix, creating an urgent need for effective Automated Program Repair (APR) methods. However, the complexity of modern bugs often makes precise root cause analysis difficult and unreliable. To address this challenge, we propose crash-site repair to simplify the repair task while still mitigating the risk of exploitation. In addition, we introduce a template-guided patch generation approach that significantly reduces the token cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining both efficiency and effectiveness. We implement our prototype system, WILLIAMT, and evaluate it against state-of-the-art APR tools. Our results show that, when combined with the top-performing agent CodeRover-S, WILLIAMT reduces token cost by 45.9% and increases the bug-fixing rate to 73.5% (+29.6%) on ARVO, a ground-truth open source software vulnerabilities benchmark. Furthermore, we demonstrate that WILLIAMT can function effectively even without access to frontier LLMs: even a local model running on a Mac M4 Mini achieves a reasonable repair rate. These findings highlight the broad applicability and scalability of WILLIAMT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Reasoning for Repair Based on Inferred Program Intent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13008v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has shown promising results, particularly with the use of neural networks. Currently, most APR tools focus on code transformations specified by test suites, rather than reasoning about the program intent and the high-level bug specification. Without a proper understanding of program intent, these tools tend to generate patches that overfit incomplete test suites and fail to reflect the developers intentions. However, reasoning about program intent is challenging. In our work, we propose an approach called AdverIntent-Agent, based on critique and adversarial reasoning. Our approach is novel to shift the focus from generating multiple APR patches to inferring multiple potential program intents. Ideally, we aim to infer intents that are, to some extent, adversarial to each other, maximizing the probability that at least one aligns closely with the developers original intent. AdverIntent-Agent is a multi-agent approach consisting of three agents: a reasoning agent, a test agent, and a repair agent. First, the reasoning agent generates adversarial program intents along with the corresponding faulty statements. Next, the test agent produces adversarial test cases that align with each inferred intent, constructing oracles that use the same inputs but have different expected outputs. Finally, the repair agent uses dynamic and precise LLM prompts to generate patches that satisfy both the inferred program intent and the generated tests. AdverIntent-Agent was evaluated on two benchmarks: Defects4J 2.0 and HumanEval-Java. AdverIntent-Agent correctly repaired 77 and 105 bugs in both benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[CPRet: A Dataset, Benchmark, and Model for Retrieval in Competitive Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12925v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competitive programming benchmarks are widely used in scenarios such as programming contests and large language model assessments. However, the growing presence of duplicate or highly similar problems raises concerns not only about competition fairness, but also about the validity of competitive programming as a benchmark for model evaluation. In this paper, we propose a new problem -- similar question retrieval -- to address this issue. Due to the lack of both data and models, solving this problem is challenging. To this end, we introduce CPRet, a retrieval-oriented benchmark suite for competitive programming, covering four retrieval tasks: two code-centric (i.e., Text-to-Code and Code-to-Code) and two newly proposed problem-centric tasks (i.e., Problem-to-Duplicate and Simplified-to-Full), built from a combination of automatically crawled problem-solution data and manually curated annotations. Our contribution includes both high-quality training data and temporally separated test sets for reliable evaluation. In addition, we develop two task-specialized retrievers based on this dataset: CPRetriever-Code, trained with a novel Group-InfoNCE loss for problem-code alignment, and CPRetriever-Prob, fine-tuned for identifying problem-level similarity. Both models achieve strong results and are open-sourced for local use. Finally, we analyze LiveCodeBench and find that high-similarity problems inflate model pass rates and reduce differentiation, underscoring the need for similarity-aware evaluation in future benchmarks.

| **[CodeGRAG: Bridging the Gap between Natural Language and Programming Language via Graphical Retrieval Augmented Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.02355v4)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Utilizing large language models to generate codes has shown promising meaning in software development revolution. Despite the intelligence shown by the large language models, their specificity in code generation can still be improved due to the syntactic gap and mismatched vocabulary existing between natural language and programming languages. In this paper, we propose CodeGRAG, a Graphical Retrieval Augmented Code Generation framework that bridges the gap between NL and PL to enhance the performance of LLMs. CodeGRAG builds the graphical view of code blocks based on the control flow and data flow of them to better interpret the programming domain knowledge, which can facilitate natural language based LLMs for better understanding of code syntax and serve as a bridge among different programming languages. To take the extracted structural knowledge into the foundation models, we propose 1) a hard meta-graph prompt template to transform the challenging syntax graph into informative graphical view for tuning-free models and 2) a soft prompting technique that injects the domain knowledge of programming languages into model parameters via finetuning the models with the soft signals encoded by GNN expert model. Specifically, two constraints are designed to improve the alignment and structure expressiveness, contributing to the informativeness of the single-token-sized external <GraphEmb> for enhanced code generation. CodeGRAG significantly improves the code generation ability of LLMs and can even offer performance gain for cross-lingual code generation. Implementation is available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/Code-5970/ .</p></details> |  |
| **[On-Policy Optimization with Group Equivalent Preference for Multi-Programming Language Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12723v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance in code generation tasks. However, a significant performance disparity persists between popular programming languages (e.g., Python, C++) and others. To address this capability gap, we leverage the code translation task to train LLMs, thereby facilitating the transfer of coding proficiency across diverse programming languages. Moreover, we introduce OORL for training, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates on-policy and off-policy strategies. Within OORL, on-policy RL is applied during code translation, guided by a rule-based reward signal derived from unit tests. Complementing this coarse-grained rule-based reward, we propose Group Equivalent Preference Optimization (GEPO), a novel preference optimization method. Specifically, GEPO trains the LLM using intermediate representations (IRs) groups. LLMs can be guided to discern IRs equivalent to the source code from inequivalent ones, while also utilizing signals about the mutual equivalence between IRs within the group. This process allows LLMs to capture nuanced aspects of code functionality. By employing OORL for training with code translation tasks, LLMs improve their recognition of code functionality and their understanding of the relationships between code implemented in different languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our OORL for LLMs training with code translation tasks achieves significant performance improvements on code benchmarks across multiple programming languages.</p></details> |  |

However, prior AI applications lack support for text-to-parametric models, essential for generating and optimizing diverse parametric design options. This study introduces Text-to-Visual Programming (Text2VP) GPT, a novel generative AI derived from GPT-4.1, designed to automate graph-based visual programming workflows, parameters, and their interconnections. Text2VP leverages detailed documentation, specific instructions, and example-driven few-shot learning to reflect user intentions accurately and facilitate interactive parameter adjustments. Testing demonstrates Text2VP's capability in generating functional parametric models, although higher complexity models present increased error rates. This research highlights generative AI's potential in visual programming and parametric modeling, laying groundwork for future improvements to manage complex modeling tasks. Ultimately, Text2VP aims to enable designers to easily create and modify parametric models without extensive training in specialized platforms like Grasshopper.</p></details> | <details><summary>Demon...</summary><p>Demonstration Video: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUOmOLuLSaDWss2En2buixBxvTPy-lDvA</p></details> |

While learning-to-optimize (L2O) methods have been successful at continuous optimization, extending them to MINLPs is challenging due to integer constraints. To overcome this, we propose a novel L2O approach with two integer correction layers to ensure the integrality of the solution and a projection step to ensure the feasibility of the solution. We prove that the projection step converges, providing a theoretical guarantee for our method. Our experiments show that our methods efficiently solve MINLPs with up to tens of thousands of variables, providing high-quality solutions within milliseconds, even for problems where traditional solvers and heuristics fail. This is the first general L2O method for parametric MINLPs, finding solutions to some of the largest instances reported to date.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Program Quantum Measurements for Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13525v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancements in quantum computing (QC) and machine learning (ML) have sparked significant interest, driving extensive exploration of quantum machine learning (QML) algorithms to address a wide range of complex challenges. The development of high-performance QML models requires expert-level expertise, presenting a key challenge to the widespread adoption of QML. Critical obstacles include the design of effective data encoding strategies and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which are vital for the performance of QML models. Furthermore, the measurement process is often neglected-most existing QML models employ predefined measurement schemes that may not align with the specific requirements of the targeted problem. We propose an innovative framework that renders the observable of a quantum system-specifically, the Hermitian matrix-trainable. This approach employs an end-to-end differentiable learning framework, enabling simultaneous optimization of the neural network used to program the parameterized observables and the standard quantum circuit parameters. Notably, the quantum observable parameters are dynamically programmed by the neural network, allowing the observables to adapt in real time based on the input data stream. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method effectively programs observables dynamically within variational quantum circuits, achieving superior results compared to existing approaches. Notably, it delivers enhanced performance metrics, such as higher classification accuracy, thereby significantly improving the overall effectiveness of QML models.</p></details> |  |
| **[EVALOOP: Assessing LLM Robustness in Programming from a Self-consistency Perspective](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12185v1)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assessing the programming capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) is crucial for their effective use in software engineering. Current evaluations, however, predominantly measure the accuracy of generated code on static benchmarks, neglecting the critical aspect of model robustness during programming tasks. While adversarial attacks offer insights on model robustness, their effectiveness is limited and evaluation could be constrained. Current adversarial attack methods for robustness evaluation yield inconsistent results, struggling to provide a unified evaluation across different LLMs. We introduce EVALOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluate the robustness from a self-consistency perspective, i.e., leveraging the natural duality inherent in popular software engineering tasks, e.g., code generation and code summarization. EVALOOP initiates a self-contained feedback loop: an LLM generates output (e.g., code) from an input (e.g., natural language specification), and then use the generated output as the input to produce a new output (e.g., summarizes that code into a new specification). EVALOOP repeats the process to assess the effectiveness of EVALOOP in each loop. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without rely on any external attack setups, providing a unified metric to evaluate LLMs' robustness in programming. We evaluate 16 prominent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.1, O4-mini) on EVALOOP and found that EVALOOP typically induces a 5.01%-19.31% absolute drop in pass@1 performance within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, GPT-3.5-Turbo, despite superior initial code generation compared to DeepSeek-V2, demonstrated lower robustness over repeated evaluation loop.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Co-Evolutionary Defence of Active Directory Attack Graphs via GNN-Approximated Dynamic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11710v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern enterprise networks increasingly rely on Active Directory (AD) for identity and access management. However, this centralization exposes a single point of failure, allowing adversaries to compromise high-value assets. Existing AD defense approaches often assume static attacker behavior, but real-world adversaries adapt dynamically, rendering such methods brittle. To address this, we model attacker-defender interactions in AD as a Stackelberg game between an adaptive attacker and a proactive defender. We propose a co-evolutionary defense framework that combines Graph Neural Network Approximated Dynamic Programming (GNNDP) to model attacker strategies, with Evolutionary Diversity Optimization (EDO) to generate resilient blocking strategies. To ensure scalability, we introduce a Fixed-Parameter Tractable (FPT) graph reduction method that reduces complexity while preserving strategic structure. Our framework jointly refines attacker and defender policies to improve generalization and prevent premature convergence. Experiments on synthetic AD graphs show near-optimal results (within 0.1 percent of optimality on r500) and improved performance on larger graphs (r1000 and r2000), demonstrating the framework's scalability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalization Guarantees for Learning Branch-and-Cut Policies in Integer Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11636v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-integer programming (MIP) provides a powerful framework for optimization problems, with Branch-and-Cut (B&C) being the predominant algorithm in state-of-the-art solvers. The efficiency of B&C critically depends on heuristic policies for making sequential decisions, including node selection, cut selection, and branching variable selection. While traditional solvers often employ heuristics with manually tuned parameters, recent approaches increasingly leverage machine learning, especially neural networks, to learn these policies directly from data. A key challenge is to understand the theoretical underpinnings of these learned policies, particularly their generalization performance from finite data. This paper establishes rigorous sample complexity bounds for learning B&C policies where the scoring functions guiding each decision step (node, cut, branch) have a certain piecewise polynomial structure. This structure generalizes the linear models that form the most commonly deployed policies in practice and investigated recently in a foundational series of theoretical works by Balcan et al. Such piecewise polynomial policies also cover the neural network architectures (e.g., using ReLU activations) that have been the focal point of contemporary practical studies. Consequently, our theoretical framework closely reflects the models utilized by practitioners investigating machine learning within B&C, offering a unifying perspective relevant to both established theory and modern empirical research in this area. Furthermore, our theory applies to quite general sequential decision making problems beyond B&C.</p></details> |  |

Tubular structures naturally yield circular cross-sections when inflated, whereas a robotic sling must be both thin enough to grow between them and their resting surface and wide enough to cradle the human. Recent works have achieved flattened cross-sections by including rigid components into the structure, but this reduces conformability to the human. We present a method of mechanically programming the cross-section of soft everting robotic structures using flexible strips that constrain radial expansion between points along the outer membrane. Our method enables simultaneously wide and thin profiles while maintaining the full multi-axis flexibility of traditional slings. We develop and validate a model relating the geometric design specifications to the fabrication parameters, and experimentally characterize their effects on growth rate. Finally, we prototype a soft growing robotic sling system and demonstrate its use for assisting a single caregiver in bed-to-chair patient transfer.</p></details> |  |

By identifying specific issues students face, educators can provide targeted assistance to help them overcome obstacles and improve learning outcomes. While identifying sources of struggle, such as misconceptions, in real-time can be challenging in current educational practices, analyzing logical errors in students' code can offer valuable insights. This paper presents a scalable framework for automatically detecting logical errors in students' programming solutions. Our framework is based on an explainable Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) embedding model, the Subtree-based Attention Neural Network (SANN), that identifies the structural components of programs containing logical errors. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate its effectiveness, and the results suggest that our framework can accurately capture students' logical errors and, more importantly, provide us with deeper insights into their learning processes, offering a valuable tool for enhancing programming education.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 18th International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM), 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Curious Case of Class Accuracy Imbalance in LLMs: Post-hoc Debiasing via Nonlinear Integer Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07623v6)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are good knowledge bases but struggle to perform equally well for all classes in text classification. This paper investigates the case of class accuracy imbalance in LLMs, where deeply entangled pretraining biases and prompt-specific cues contribute to the imbalance. To overcome the difficulty in bias identification and inaccessibility of retraining, we post-hoc balance class accuracy using only output probabilities. This is enabled by reformulating debiasing as a combinatorial optimization problem. In details, we first motivate a post-hoc bias metric, the Contextual Oddity Bias (COBias), to quantify the over-/under-prediction (a tendency to over-predict some classes while under-predicting others) in LLMs. We then propose the Debiasing as Nonlinear Integer Programming (DNIP) method to reweight LLM output class probabilities towards minimizing COBias and max12 imizing overall accuracy, without being constrained by bias sources or updating LLM parameters. Since the DNIP model contains non-differentiable elements, we use simulated annealing to efficiently solve it. Evaluations on five LLMs across NLP classification benchmarks show that DNIP simultaneously achieves signifi16 cant COBias reduction (61% relative reduction) and accuracy improvement (18% relative increase) under different LLM prompting setups.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor Network Structure Search with Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02711v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor networks provide a powerful framework for compressing multi-dimensional data. The optimal tensor network structure for a given data tensor depends on both data characteristics and specific optimality criteria, making tensor network structure search a difficult problem. Existing solutions typically rely on sampling and compressing numerous candidate structures; these procedures are computationally expensive and therefore limiting for practical applications. We address this challenge by viewing tensor network structure search as a program synthesis problem and introducing an efficient constraint-based assessment method that avoids costly tensor decomposition. Specifically, we establish a correspondence between transformation programs and network structures. We also design a novel operation named output-directed splits to reduce the search space without hindering expressiveness. We then propose a synthesis algorithm to identify promising network candidates through constraint solving, and avoid tensor decomposition for all but the most promising candidates. Experimental results show that our approach improves search speed by up to $10\times$ and achieves compression ratios $1.5\times$ to $3\times$ better than state-of-the-art. Notably, our approach scales to larger tensors that are unattainable by prior work. Furthermore, the discovered topologies generalize well to similar data, yielding compression ratios up to $ 2.4\times$ better than a generic structure while the runtime remains around $110$ seconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Current Language Models Support Code Intelligence for R Programming Language?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07793v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in developing Pre-trained Language Models for Code (Code-PLMs) have urged many areas of Software Engineering (SE) and brought breakthrough results for many SE tasks. Though these models have achieved the state-of-the-art performance for SE tasks for many popular programming languages, such as Java and Python, the Scientific Software and its related languages like R programming language have rarely benefited or even been evaluated with the Code-PLMs. Research has shown that R has many differences with other programming languages and requires specific techniques. In this study, we provide the first insights for code intelligence for R. For this purpose, we collect and open source an R dataset, and evaluate Code-PLMs for the two tasks of code summarization and method name prediction using several settings and strategies, including the differences in two R styles, Tidy-verse and Base R. Our results demonstrate that the studied models have experienced varying degrees of performance degradation when processing R programming language code, which is supported by human evaluation. Additionally, not all models show performance improvement in R-specific tasks even after multi-language fine-tuning. The dual syntax paradigms in R significantly impact the models' performance, particularly in code summarization tasks. Furthermore, the project-specific context inherent in R codebases significantly impacts the performance when attempting cross-project training.</p></details> |  |

However, most modern integrated development environments (IDEs) have not fully adapted to this paradigm shift. For example, physical 3D objects in the real world are still represented as 2D text variables in code, creating a significant perceptual distance between these representations. In response to this challenge, we introduce SnapNCode, a novel IDE for spatial programming. SnapNCode enables programmers to capture various states of physical objects through live video streams from cameras and directly insert these visual representations into their code. Moreover, users can augment physical objects by attaching code snippets onto objects, which are opportunistically triggered when observed by cameras. We conducted a user study (N=12) to assess the usability of SnapNCode. Feedback from participants indicates that the system is easy-to-use and holds promise for daily casual uses and integration into a broader range of workflows.</p></details> | 18 pages, HCII 2025 |

It is an invaluable tool for signal processing and machine learning, because many key metrics in these fields are fractionally structured, e.g., the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) in wireless communications, the Cram\'{e}r-Rao bound (CRB) in radar sensing, the normalized cut in graph clustering, and the margin in support vector machine (SVM). This article provides a comprehensive review of both the theory and applications of a recently developed FP technique known as the quadratic transform, which can be applied to a wide variety of FP problems, including both the minimization and the maximization of the sum of functions of ratios as well as matrix-ratio problems.</p></details> | 20 pages |

P4, a language designed for programming data-plane devices, allows developers to define custom packet processing behaviors directly on programmable network devices. This provides greater control over packet forwarding, inspection, and modification. However, the increased flexibility provided by P4 also brings significant security challenges, particularly in managing sensitive data and preventing information leakage within the data-plane. This paper presents a novel security type system for analyzing information flow in P4 programs that combines security types with interval analysis. The proposed type system allows the specification of security policies in terms of input and output packet bit fields rather than program variables. We formalize this type system and prove it sound, guaranteeing that well-typed programs satisfy noninterference. Our prototype implementation, Tap4s, is evaluated on several use cases, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting security violations and information leakages.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, including references and appendix.

These NP-hard problems have far-reaching applications, yet the non-convex cases have received limited attention in the literature. To address this gap, we introduce a closed-form formula for single-variable changes, establishing novel necessary and sufficient conditions for 1-Opt local improvement in UQIP and CQIP. We develop a simple local and sophisticated tabu search with an oscillation strategy tailored for large-scale problems. Experimental results on instances with up to 8000 variables demonstrate the efficiency of these strategies, producing high-quality solutions within a short time. Our approaches significantly outperform the Gurobi 11.0.2 solver.</p></details> | 39 pages, 8 figures |

They require quantum programs that define operations on quantum bits (qubits), the fundamental units of computation. Unlike traditional software development, the process of creating and debugging quantum programs requires specialized knowledge of quantum computation, making the development process more challenging. In this paper, we apply and evaluate mutation-based fault localization (MBFL) for quantum programs with the aim of enhancing debugging efficiency. We use quantum mutation operations, which are specifically designed for quantum programs, to identify faults. Our evaluation involves 23 real-world faults and 305 artificially induced faults in quantum programs developed with Qiskit(R). The results show that real-world faults are more challenging for MBFL than artificial faults. In fact, the median EXAM score, which represents the percentage of the code examined before locating the faulty statement (lower is better), is 1.2% for artificial benchmark and 19.4% for the real-world benchmark in the worst-case scenario. Our study highlights the potential and limitations of MBFL for quantum programs, considering different fault types and mutation operation types. Finally, we discuss future directions for improving MBFL in the context of quantum programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, Accepted at Short Papers, Emerging Results in the International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE), 2025</p></details> |

In its current implementation, DIDP guides the search using user-defined dual bounds. Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly being applied to combinatorial optimization problems and shares several key structures with DP, being represented by the Bellman equation and state-based transition systems. We propose using reinforcement learning to obtain a heuristic function to guide the search in DIDP. We develop two RL-based guidance approaches: value-based guidance using Deep Q-Networks and policy-based guidance using Proximal Policy Optimization. Our experiments indicate that RL-based guidance significantly outperforms standard DIDP and problem-specific greedy heuristics with the same number of node expansions. Further, despite longer node evaluation times, RL guidance achieves better run-time performance than standard DIDP on three of four benchmark domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 figures, to be published in CPAIOR 2025 (https://sites.google.com/view/cpaior2025)</p></details> |
| **[Comparing Parallel Functional Array Languages: Programming and Performance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08906v1)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parallel functional array languages are an emerging class of programming languages that promise to combine low-effort parallel programming with good performance and performance portability. We systematically compare the designs and implementations of five different functional array languages: Accelerate, APL, DaCe, Futhark, and SaC. We demonstrate the expressiveness of functional array programming by means of four challenging benchmarks, namely N-body simulation, MultiGrid, Quickhull, and Flash Attention. These benchmarks represent a range of application domains and parallel computational models. We argue that the functional array code is much shorter and more comprehensible than the hand-optimized baseline implementations because it omits architecture-specific aspects. Instead, the language implementations generate both multicore and GPU executables from a single source code base. Hence, we further argue that functional array code could more easily be ported to, and optimized for, new parallel architectures than conventional implementations of numerical kernels. We demonstrate this potential by reporting the performance of the five parallel functional array languages on a total of 39 instances of the four benchmarks on both a 32-core AMD EPYC 7313 multicore system and on an NVIDIA A30 GPU. We explore in-depth why each language performs well or not so well on each benchmark and architecture. We argue that the results demonstrate that mature functional array languages have the potential to deliver performance competitive with the best available conventional techniques.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, if a quantum party can execute a semi-quantum token scheme (Shmueli 2022) with probability of success $1/2 + \delta$, we can build powerful cryptographic primitives with a multiplicative logarithmic overhead for the desired correctness error. Our scheme makes no assumptions about the quantum party's noise model except for a simple independence requirement: noise on two sets of non-entangled hardware must be independent. Using semi-quantum tokens and oracles which can only be queried classically, we first show how to construct a "short-lived" semi-quantum one-time program (OTP) which allows a classical sending party to prepare a one-time program on the receiving party's quantum computer. We then show how to use this semi-quantum OTP to construct a semi-quantum "stateful obfuscation" scheme (which we term "RAM obfuscation"). Importantly, the RAM obfuscation scheme does not require long-term quantum memory or global entanglement. Finally, we show how RAM obfuscation can be used to build long-lived one-time programs and copy-protection schemes.</p></details> |  |
| **[CursorCore: Assist Programming through Aligning Anything](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07002v3)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have been successfully applied to programming assistance tasks, such as code completion, code insertion, and instructional code editing. However, these applications remain insufficiently automated and struggle to effectively integrate various types of information during the programming process, including coding history, current code, and user instructions. In this work, we propose a new conversational framework that comprehensively integrates these information sources, collect data to train our models and evaluate their performance. Firstly, to thoroughly evaluate how well models align with different types of information and the quality of their outputs, we introduce a new benchmark, APEval (Assist Programming Eval), to comprehensively assess the performance of models in programming assistance tasks. Then, for data collection, we develop a data generation pipeline, Programming-Instruct, which synthesizes training data from diverse sources, such as GitHub and online judge platforms. This pipeline can automatically generate various types of messages throughout the programming process. Finally, using this pipeline, we generate 219K samples, fine-tune multiple models, and develop the CursorCore series. We show that CursorCore outperforms other models of comparable size. This framework unifies applications such as inline chat and automated editing, contributes to the advancement of coding assistants.

| **[A Quantum Constraint Generation Framework for Binary Linear Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21222v2)** | 2025-05-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new approach to utilize quantum computers for binary linear programming (BLP), which can be extended to general integer linear programs (ILP). Quantum optimization algorithms, hybrid or quantum-only, are currently general purpose, standalone solvers for ILP. However, to consider them practically useful, we expect them to overperform the current state of the art classical solvers. That expectation is unfair to quantum algorithms: in classical ILP solvers, after many decades of evolution, many different algorithms work together as a robust machine to get the best result. This is the approach we would like to follow now with our quantum 'solver' solutions. In this study we wrap any suitable quantum optimization algorithm into a quantum informed classical constraint generation framework. First we relax our problem by dropping all constraints and encode it into an Ising Hamiltonian for the quantum optimization subroutine. Then, by sampling from the solution state of the subroutine, we obtain information about constraint violations in the initial problem, from which we decide which coupling terms we need to introduce to the Hamiltonian. The coupling terms correspond to the constraints of the initial binary linear program. Then we optimize over the new Hamiltonian again, until we reach a feasible solution, or other stopping conditions hold. Since one can decide how many constraints they add to the Hamiltonian in a single step, our algorithm is at least as efficient as the (hybrid) quantum optimization algorithm it wraps. We support our claim with results on small scale minimum cost exact cover problem instances.</p></details> |  |

This paper examines why traditional code plagiarism detection methods frequently fail in these environments and explores the implications of emerging factors such as generative AI (genAI). Drawing on the author's experience teaching a Competitive Programming 1 (CP1) course over seven semesters at Purdue University (with $\approx 100$ students each term) and completely redesigning the CP1/2/3 course sequence, we provide an academically grounded analysis. We review literature on code plagiarism in computer science education, survey current detection tools (Moss, Kattis, etc.) and methods (manual review, code-authorship interviews), and analyze their strengths and limitations. Experience-based observations are presented to illustrate real-world detection failures and successes. We find that widely-used automated similarity checkers can be thwarted by simple code transformations or novel AI-generated code, while human-centric approaches like oral interviews, though effective, are labor-intensive. The paper concludes with opinions and preliminary recommendations for improving academic integrity in programming courses, advocating for a multi-faceted approach that combines improved detection algorithms, mastery-based learning techniques, and authentic assessment practices to better ensure code originality.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 3 figures, 2 tables, submitted for publication</p></details> |

An Empirical Evaluation of Generative AI as a Collaborative Teammate in a Semester-Long Classroom Setting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.08119v1)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI (GenAI), especially Large Language Models (LLMs), is rapidly reshaping both programming workflows and computer science education. Many programmers now incorporate GenAI tools into their workflows, including for collaborative coding tasks such as pair programming. While prior research has demonstrated the benefits of traditional pair programming and begun to explore GenAI-assisted coding, the role of LLM-based tools as collaborators in pair programming remains underexamined. In this work, we conducted a mixed-methods study with 39 undergraduate students to examine how GenAI influences collaboration, learning, and performance in pair programming. Specifically, students completed six in-class assignments under three conditions: Traditional Pair Programming (PP), Pair Programming with GenAI (PAI), and Solo Programming with GenAI (SAI). They used both LLM-based inline completion tools (e.g., GitHub Copilot) and LLM-based conversational tools (e.g., ChatGPT). Our results show that students in PAI achieved the highest assignment scores, whereas those in SAI attained the lowest. Additionally, students' attitudes toward LLMs' programming capabilities improved significantly after collaborating with LLM-based tools, and preferences were largely shaped by the perceived usefulness for completing assignments and learning programming skills, as well as the quality of collaboration. Our qualitative findings further reveal that while students appreciated LLM-based tools as valuable pair programming partners, they also identified limitations and had different expectations compared to human teammates. Our study provides one of the first empirical evaluations of GenAI as a pair programming collaborator through a comparison of three conditions (PP, PAI, and SAI). We also discuss the design implications and pedagogical considerations for future GenAI-assisted pair programming approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Learning @ Scale 2025</p></details> |

The Clarke subdifferential and surrogate functions are not readily obtainable due to the latent decision dependency. To deal with such a computational difficulty, we develop an adaptive learning-based surrogate method that integrates the simulation scheme and statistical estimates to construct estimation-based surrogate functions in a way that the simulation process is adaptively guided by the algorithmic procedure. We establish the non-asymptotic convergence rate analysis in terms of $(\nu, \delta)$-near stationarity in expectation under variable proximal parameters and batch sizes, which exhibits the superior convergence performance and enhanced stability in both theory and practice. We provide numerical results with both synthetic and real data which illustrate the benefits of the proposed algorithm in terms of algorithmic stability and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[ATiM: Autotuning Tensor Programs for Processing-in-DRAM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19630v2)** | 2025-05-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Processing-in-DRAM (DRAM-PIM) has emerged as a promising technology for accelerating memory-intensive operations in modern applications, such as Large Language Models (LLMs). Despite its potential, current software stacks for DRAM-PIM face significant challenges, including reliance on hand-tuned libraries that hinder programmability, limited support for high-level abstractions, and the lack of systematic optimization frameworks. To address these limitations, we present ATiM, a search-based optimizing tensor compiler for UPMEM. Key features of ATiM include: (1) automated searches of the joint search space for host and kernel tensor programs, (2) PIM-aware optimizations for efficiently handling boundary conditions, and (3) improved search algorithms for the expanded search space of UPMEM systems. Our experimental results on UPMEM hardware demonstrate performance gains of up to 6.18$\times$ for various UPMEM benchmark kernels and 8.21$\times$ for GPT-J layers. To the best of our knowledge, ATiM is the first tensor compiler to provide fully automated, autotuning-integrated code generation support for a DRAM-PIM system. By bridging the gap between high-level tensor computation abstractions and low-level hardware-specific requirements, ATiM establishes a foundation for advancing DRAM-PIM programmability and enabling streamlined optimization.</p></details> | 17 pages, 15 figures |

Many important quantum algorithms are built upon oracle quantum programs, making it essential to ensure their correctness during development. While software testing is a well-established approach for improving program reliability, no systematic method has been developed to test oracle quantum programs. This paper proposes a black-box testing framework designed for general oracle quantum programs. We define these programs formally, establish the foundational theory for their testing, and propose a detailed testing framework. We develop a prototype tool and conduct extensive experimental evaluations to evaluate the framework's effectiveness. Our results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly aids developers in testing oracle quantum programs, providing insights to enhance the reliability of quantum software.</p></details> | 35 pages, 8 figures |

While there are many approaches to approximately solving POMDPs, we aim to address the problem of learning such models. In particular, we are interested in a subclass of POMDPs wherein the components of the model, including the observation function, reward function, transition function, and initial state distribution function, can be modeled as low-complexity probabilistic graphical models in the form of a short probabilistic program. Our strategy to learn these programs uses an LLM as a prior, generating candidate probabilistic programs that are then tested against the empirical distribution and adjusted through feedback. We experiment on a number of classical toy POMDP problems, simulated MiniGrid domains, and two real mobile-base robotics search domains involving partial observability. Our results show that using an LLM to guide in the construction of a low-complexity POMDP model can be more effective than tabular POMDP learning, behavior cloning, or direct LLM planning.</p></details> |  |

This paper proposes the concept of maturity to fill this gap and introduces the Grant Maturity Framework (GMF), a mixed-methods model for evaluating the maturity of Web3 grant programs. The GMF provides a systematic approach to assessing the structure, governance, and impact of Web3 grants, applied here to four prominent Ethereum layer-two (L2) grant programs: Arbitrum, Optimism, Mantle, and Taiko. By evaluating these programs using the GMF, the study categorizes them into four maturity stages, ranging from experimental to advanced. The findings reveal that Arbitrum's Long-Term Incentive Pilot Program (LTIPP) and Optimism's Mission Rounds show higher maturity, while Mantle and Taiko are still in their early stages. The research concludes by discussing the user-centric development of a Web3 grant management platform aimed at improving the maturity and effectiveness of Web3 grant management processes based on the findings from the GMF. This work contributes to both practical and theoretical knowledge on Web3 grant program evaluation and tooling, providing a valuable resource for Web3 grant operators and stakeholders.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Collaborative Conversational Agent System Based on LLMs and Answer Set Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06438v1)** | 2025-05-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the Large-Language-Model-driven (LLM-driven) Artificial Intelligence (AI) bots became popular, people realized their strong potential in Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD). However, bots relying wholly on LLMs are unreliable in their knowledge, and whether they can finally produce a correct result for the task is not guaranteed. The collaboration among these agents also remains a challenge, since the necessary information to convey is unclear, and the information transfer is by prompts -- unreliable, and malicious knowledge is easy to inject. With the help of logic programming tools such as Answer Set Programming (ASP), conversational agents can be built safely and reliably, and communication among the agents made more efficient and secure. We proposed an Administrator-Assistant Dual-Agent paradigm, where the two ASP-driven bots share the same knowledge base and complete their tasks independently, while the information can be passed by a Collaborative Rule Set (CRS). The knowledge and information conveyed are encapsulated and invisible to the users, ensuring the security of information transmission. We have constructed AutoManager, a dual-agent system for managing the drive-through window of a fast-food restaurant such as Taco Bell in the US. In AutoManager, the assistant bot takes the customer's order while the administrator bot manages the menu and food supply. We evaluated our AutoManager and compared it with the real-world Taco Bell Drive-Thru AI Order Taker, and the results show that our method is more reliable.</p></details> | 14 pages |

A unique adaptive intervention design paradigm is presented in this work, where causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are for effectively recovered with practical budgetary considerations. In order to choose treatments that optimize information gain under these considerations, an iterative integer programming (IP) approach is proposed, which drastically reduces the number of experiments required. Simulations over a broad range of graph sizes and edge densities are used to assess the effectiveness of the suggested approach. Results show that the proposed adaptive IP approach achieves full causal graph recovery with fewer intervention iterations and variable manipulations than random intervention baselines, and it is also flexible enough to accommodate a variety of practical constraints.</p></details> |  |

However, the automatically generated test input does not always make sense, and the automated assertion is difficult to validate against the program under test. In this paper, we propose JustinANN, a flexible and scalable tool to generate test cases for Java programs, providing realistic test inputs and assertions. We have observed that, in practice, Java programs contain a large number of annotations from programs, which can be considered as part of the user specification. We design a systematic annotation set with 7 kinds of annotations and 4 combination rules based on them to modify complex Java objects. Annotations that modify the fields or return variables of methods can be used to generate assertions that represent the true intent of the program, and the ones that modify the input parameters can be used to generate test inputs that match the real business requirement. We have conducted experiments to evaluate the approach on open source Java programs. The results show that the annotations and their combinations designed in this paper are compatible with existing annotations; our approach is easier to generate test data in, on and outside the boundaries of the requirement domain; and it also helps to find program defects.</p></details> |  |

Existing learning-based methods like Neural Two-Stage Stochastic Programming (Neur2SP) employ neural networks (NNs) as recourse function surrogates but rely on computationally intensive mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations. We propose ICNN-enhanced 2SP, a method that leverages Input Convex Neural Networks (ICNNs) to exploit linear programming (LP) representability in convex 2SP problems. By architecturally enforcing convexity and enabling exact inference through LP, our approach eliminates the need for integer variables inherent to the conventional MIP-based formulation while retaining an exact embedding of the ICNN surrogate within the 2SP framework. This results in a more computationally efficient alternative that maintains solution quality. Comprehensive experiments reveal that ICNNs incur only marginally longer training times while achieving validation accuracy on par with their MIP-based counterparts. Across benchmark problems, ICNN-enhanced 2SP often exhibits considerably faster solution times than the MIP-based formulations while preserving solution quality, with these advantages becoming significantly more pronounced as problem scale increases. For the most challenging instances, the method achieves speedups of up to 100$\times$ and solution quality superior to MIP-based formulations.</p></details> |  |

The Program Evaluation and Review Technique provides a probabilistic framework to model task variability and critical paths. In this paper, the author presents a novel formulation of PERT scheduling as an energy minimization problem within a Hopfield neural network architecture. By mapping task start times and precedence constraints into a neural computation framework, the networks inherent optimization dynamics is exploited to approximate globally consistent schedules. The author addresses key theoretical issues related to energy function differentiability, constraint encoding, and convergence, and extends the Hopfield model for structured precedence graphs. Numerical simulations on synthetic project networks comprising up to 1000 tasks demonstrate the viability of this approach, achieving near optimal makespans with minimal constraint violations. The findings suggest that neural optimization models offer a promising direction for scalable and adaptive project tasks scheduling under uncertainty in areas such as the agentic AI workflows, microservice based applications that the modern AI systems are being built upon.</p></details> |  |

While extensive research has explored the effectiveness of LLMs in supporting student learning, limited studies have examined how these models can assist instructors in designing instructional activities. This work investigates how instructors' expertise in effective activity design can be integrated with LLMs' ability to generate novel and targeted programming problems, facilitating more effective activity creation for programming classrooms. To achieve this, we employ a participatory design approach to develop an instructor-authoring tool that incorporates LLM support, fostering collaboration between instructors and AI in generating programming exercises. This tool also allows instructors to specify common student mistakes and misconceptions, which informs the adaptive feedback generation process. We conduct case studies with three instructors, analyzing how they use our system to design programming problems for their introductory courses. Through these case studies, we assess instructors' perceptions of the usefulness and limitations of LLMs in authoring problem statements for instructional purposes. Additionally, we compare the efficiency, quality, effectiveness, and coverage of designed activities when instructors create problems with and without structured LLM prompting guidelines. Our findings provide insights into the potential of LLMs in enhancing instructor workflows and improving programming education and provide guidelines for designing effective AI-assisted problem-authoring interfaces.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CHI 2025 Workshop on Augmented Educators and AI: Shaping the Future of Human and AI Cooperation in Learning</p></details> |

However, the inner mechanism of CoT still remains largely unclear. In this paper, we empirically study the role of CoT tokens in LLMs on two compositional tasks: multi-digit multiplication and dynamic programming. While CoT is essential for solving these problems, we find that preserving only tokens that store intermediate results would achieve comparable performance. Furthermore, we observe that storing intermediate results in an alternative latent form will not affect model performance. We also randomly intervene some values in CoT, and notice that subsequent CoT tokens and the final answer would change correspondingly. These findings suggest that CoT tokens may function like variables in computer programs but with potential drawbacks like unintended shortcuts and computational complexity limits between tokens.

To manage this crucial challenge, we employed a novel design process based on a large-scale, longitudinal, community-based structure. Across three annual programs we engaged with the BVI community in online and in-person modes. In total, our team included 67 total BVI participatory design participants online, 11 BVI co-designers in-person, and 4 BVI program coordinators. Through this design process we built a mobile application that enables users to generate, share, and navigate maps of indoor and outdoor environments without the need to instrument each environment with beacons or fiducial markers. We evaluated this app at a healthcare facility, and participants in the evaluation rated the app highly with respect to its design, features, and potential for positive impact on quality of life.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Effectively Leveraging Execution Traces for Program Repair with Code LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04441v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) show promising performance on various programming tasks, including Automatic Program Repair (APR). However, most approaches to LLM-based APR are limited to the static analysis of the programs, while disregarding their runtime behavior. Inspired by knowledge-augmented NLP, in this work, we aim to remedy this potential blind spot by augmenting standard APR prompts with program execution traces. We evaluate our approach using the GPT family of models on three popular APR datasets. Our findings suggest that simply incorporating execution traces into the prompt provides a limited performance improvement over trace-free baselines, in only 2 out of 6 tested dataset / model configurations. We further find that the effectiveness of execution traces for APR diminishes as their complexity increases. We explore several strategies for leveraging traces in prompts and demonstrate that LLM-optimized prompts help outperform trace-free prompts more consistently. Additionally, we show trace-based prompting to be superior to finetuning a smaller LLM on a small-scale dataset; and conduct probing studies reinforcing the notion that execution traces can complement the reasoning abilities of the LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond entropic regularization: Debiased Gaussian estimators for discrete optimal transport and general linear programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04312v1)** | 2025-05-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes new estimators for discrete optimal transport plans that enjoy Gaussian limits centered at the true solution. This behavior stands in stark contrast with the performance of existing estimators, including those based on entropic regularization, which are asymptotically biased and only satisfy a CLT centered at a regularized version of the population-level plan. We develop a new regularization approach based on a different class of penalty functions, which can be viewed as the duals of those previously considered in the literature. The key feature of these penalty schemes it that they give rise to preliminary estimates that are asymptotically linear in the penalization strength. Our final estimator is obtained by constructing an appropriate linear combination of two penalized solutions corresponding to two different tuning parameters so that the bias introduced by the penalization cancels out. Unlike classical debiasing procedures, therefore, our proposal entirely avoids the delicate problem of estimating and then subtracting the estimated bias term. Our proofs, which apply beyond the case of optimal transport, are based on a novel asymptotic analysis of penalization schemes for linear programs. As a corollary of our results, we obtain the consistency of the naive bootstrap for fully data-driven inference on the true optimal solution. Simulation results and two data analyses support strongly the benefits of our approach relative to existing techniques.</p></details> |  |

We analyze ten years (2015--2024) of International Collegiate Programming Contest (ICPC) standings, comprising five long-running superregional championships (Africa \& Arab, Asia East, Asia West, North America, and Northern Eurasia), associated local regionals of North America and Northern Eurasia, and the World Finals. For 366 World Finalist teams (2021--2024) we augment the dataset with pre-contest Codeforces ratings. Pairwise rank alignment is measured with Kendall's $\tau$. Overall, superregional ranks predict World Final ranks only moderately (weighted $\tau=0.407$), but regional-to-superregional consistency varies widely: Northern Eurasia exhibits the strongest alignment ($\tau=0.521$) while Asia West exhibits the weakest ($\tau=0.188$). Internal consistency within a region can exceed its predictive value for Worlds -- e.g., Northern Eurasia and North America regionals vs. superregionals ($\tau=0.666$ and $\tau=0.577$, respectively). Codeforces ratings correlate more strongly with World Final results ($\tau=0.596$) than any single ICPC tier, suggesting that high-frequency online contests capture decisive skill factors that many superregional sets miss. We argue that contest organizers can improve both fairness and pedagogical value by aligning problem style and selection rules with the formats that demonstrably differentiate teams, in particular the Northern-Eurasian model and well-curated online rounds. All data, scripts, and additional analyses are publicly released to facilitate replication and further study.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, 9 tables, submitted for publication</p></details> |

Through a series of controlled experiments, we measure the validator's throughput and resource efficiency as RAM availability ranges between 128 GB to 1,536 GB (1.5 TB). We discover that the validator performance degrades significantly below 256 GB, with transaction processing falling behind real-time block production. Additionally, we study the program cache behavior, identifying inefficiencies in program eviction and load latency. Our results provide practical guidance for hardware provisioning and suggest improvements to the Solana execution and caching strategy, reducing latency due to the program cache by 90%.</p></details> | 15 pages, 13 figures |

Task and motion planning (TAMP) addresses this by combining symbolic planning and continuous trajectory generation. Recently, foundation model approaches to TAMP have presented impressive results, including fast planning times and the execution of natural language instructions. Yet, the optimal interface between high-level planning and low-level motion generation remains an open question: prior approaches are limited by either too much abstraction (e.g., chaining simplified skill primitives) or a lack thereof (e.g., direct joint angle prediction). Our method introduces a novel technique employing a form of meta-optimization to address these issues by: (i) using program search over trajectory optimization problems as an interface between a foundation model and robot control, and (ii) leveraging a zero-order method to optimize numerical parameters in the foundation model output. Results on challenging object manipulation and drawing tasks confirm that our proposed method improves over prior TAMP approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 8 figures, under review for the 9th Annual Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2025)</p></details> |

The full model, including neural components, is discretized using a high-order implicit Runge-Kutta method with flipped Legendre-Gauss-Radau points, resulting in a large-scale nonlinear program (NLP) efficiently solved by state-of-the-art NLP solvers such as Ipopt. This formulation enables simultaneous optimization of network parameters and state trajectories, addressing key limitations of ODE solver-based training in terms of stability, runtime, and accuracy. Extending on a recent direct collocation-based method for Neural ODEs, we generalize to PeNODEs, incorporate physical constraints, and present a custom, parallelized, open-source implementation. Benchmarks on a Quarter Vehicle Model and a Van-der-Pol oscillator demonstrate superior accuracy, speed, and generalization with smaller networks compared to other training techniques. We also outline a planned integration into OpenModelica to enable accessible training of Neural DAEs.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 9 figures, submitted to 16th International Modelica & FMI Conference</p></details> |

Since the development of high-fidelity proxy-apps, which exhibit similar performance characteristics as corresponding production applications, is labor-intensive, synthetic proxy-apps are created as a useful supplement to manually developed proxy-apps. To thoroughly resemble performance characteristics of HPC applications represented by Message Passing Interface (MPI) programs, we propose Siesta, a novel framework to automatically synthesize proxy-apps based on communication-computation traces. Given an MPI program, Siesta synthesizes parameterized code snippets to mimic computation behaviors in different execution periods, and combines the code snippets and MPI function records into an event trace. It then extracts program behavior patterns from the trace as grammars and finally transforms the grammars into a synthetic proxy-app. We evaluate the proposed methods on representative MPI programs with various environments. The results show that our synthetic proxy-apps can precisely approximate the performance characteristics of MPI programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Cluster 2024</p></details> |

Recently, several authors have developed core point methods for solving symmetric integer linear programs (ILPs). An integer point is called a core point if its orbit polytope is lattice-free. It has been shown that for symmetric ILPs, optimizing over the set of core points gives the same answer as considering the entire space. Existing core point techniques rely on the number of core points (or equivalence classes) being finite, which requires special symmetry groups. In this paper we develop some new methods for solving symmetric ILPs (based on outer approximations of core points) that do not depend on finiteness but are more efficient if the group has large disjoint cycles in its set of generators.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Update discussion of single vs. multiple element essential set.

| **[The Art of Repair: Optimizing Iterative Program Repair with Instruction-Tuned Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02931v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic program repair (APR) aims to reduce the manual efforts required to identify and fix errors in source code. Before the rise of LLM-based agents, a common strategy was to increase the number of generated patches, sometimes to the thousands, to achieve better repair results on benchmarks. More recently, self-iterative capabilities enabled LLMs to refine patches over multiple rounds guided by feedback. However, literature often focuses on many iterations and disregards different numbers of outputs. We investigate an APR pipeline that balances these two approaches, the generation of multiple outputs and multiple rounds of iteration, while imposing a limit of 10 total patches per bug. We apply three SOTA instruction-tuned LLMs - DeepSeekCoder-Instruct, Codellama-Instruct, Llama3.1-Instruct - to the APR task. We further fine-tune each model on an APR dataset with three sizes (1K, 30K, 65K) and two techniques (Full Fine-Tuning and LoRA), allowing us to assess their repair capabilities on two APR benchmarks: HumanEval-Java and Defects4J. Our results show that by using only a fraction (<1%) of the fine-tuning dataset, we can achieve improvements of up to 78% in the number of plausible patches generated, challenging prior studies that reported limited gains using Full Fine-Tuning. However, we find that exceeding certain thresholds leads to diminishing outcomes, likely due to overfitting. Moreover, we show that base models greatly benefit from creating patches in an iterative fashion rather than generating them all at once. In addition, the benefit of iterative strategies becomes more pronounced in complex benchmarks. Even fine-tuned models, while benefiting less from iterations, still gain advantages, particularly on complex benchmarks. The research underscores the need for balanced APR strategies that combine multi-output generation and iterative refinement.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the research track of the 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE), 17-20 June 2025, Istanbul, T\"urkiye</p></details> |

Both tasks are solved by a two-step hierarchical algorithm. The first step differs for the two tasks generating either a piecewise-affine or a Dubins reference path. The second step leverages a transformation of vehicle dynamics from the time domain into the spatial domain and linear programming. Benefits such as a hyperparameter-free objective function and spatial constraints useful for area coverage gaps avoidance and precision path planning are discussed. The method, which is a deterministic optimisation-based method, is evaluated on 5 real-world fields solving 19 instances of the first task and 84 instances of the second task.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Users can adjust these PID parameters during flight. However, flight control programs lack sufficient safety checks on user-provided PID parameters, leading to a severe UAV vulnerability - the input validation bug. This occurs when a user misconfigures PID parameters, causing dangerous states like deviation from the expected path, loss of control, or crash. Prior works use random testing like fuzzing, but these are not effective in the three-dimensional search space of PID parameters. The expensive dynamic execution of UAV tests further hinders random testing performance. We address PID parameter misconfiguration by combining the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion with coordinate search, introducing RouthSearch. Instead of ad-hoc identification, RouthSearch principledly determines valid ranges for three-dimensional PID parameters. We first leverage the Routh-Hurwitz Criterion to identify a theoretical PID parameter boundary, then refine it using efficient coordinate search. The determined valid range can filter misconfigured PID parameters from users during flight and help discover logical bugs in flight control programs. We evaluated RouthSearch across eight flight modes in PX4 and Ardupilot. Results show RouthSearch determines valid ranges with 92.0% accuracy compared to ground truth. RouthSearch discovers 3,853 PID misconfigurations within 48 hours, while the STOA work PGFuzz discovers only 449 sets, significantly outperforming prior works by 8.58 times. Our method also helped detect three bugs in ArduPilot and PX4.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 34rd ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Conformal Predictive Programming for Chance Constrained Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07407v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose conformal predictive programming (CPP), a framework to solve chance constrained optimization problems, i.e., optimization problems with constraints that are functions of random variables. CPP utilizes samples from these random variables along with the quantile lemma - central to conformal prediction - to transform the chance constrained optimization problem into a deterministic problem with a quantile reformulation. CPP inherits a priori guarantees on constraint satisfaction from existing sample average approximation approaches for a class of chance constrained optimization problems, and it provides a posteriori guarantees that are of conditional and marginal nature otherwise. The strength of CPP is that it can easily support different variants of conformal prediction which have been (or will be) proposed within the conformal prediction community. To illustrate this, we present robust CPP to deal with distribution shifts in the random variables and Mondrian CPP to deal with class conditional chance constraints. To enable tractable solutions to the quantile reformulation, we present a mixed integer programming method (CPP-MIP) encoding, a bilevel optimization strategy (CPP-Bilevel), and a sampling-and-discarding optimization strategy (CPP-Discarding). We also extend CPP to deal with joint chance constrained optimization (JCCO). In a series of case studies, we show the validity of the aforementioned approaches, empirically compare CPP-MIP, CPP-Bilevel, as well as CPP-Discarding, and illustrate the advantage of CPP as compared to scenario approach.</p></details> |  |

Constrained by a fixed budget, decision-makers draft a squad whose players are expected to perform well in the upcoming weeks to maximize total points. This paper proposes novel deterministic and robust integer programming models that select the optimal starting eleven and the captain. A new hybrid scoring metric is constructed using an interpretable artificial intelligence framework and underlying match performance data. Several objective functions and estimation techniques are introduced for the programming model. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to approach fantasy football through this lens. The models' performance is evaluated using data from the 2023/24 Premier League season. Results indicate that the proposed hybrid method achieved the highest score while maintaining consistent performance. Utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation, the strategic choice of averaging techniques for estimating cost vectors, and the proposed hybrid approach are shown to be effective during the out-of-sample period. This paper also provides a thorough analysis of the optimal formations and players selected by the models, offering valuable insights into effective fantasy football strategies.</p></details> |  |

An attractive solution to relieve the programming burden is to transcompile the legacy code of one platform to others. However, current transcompilation techniques struggle with either tremendous manual efforts or functional incorrectness, rendering "Write Once, Run Anywhere" of tensor programs an open question. We propose a novel transcompiler, i.e., QiMeng-Xpiler, for automatically translating tensor programs across DLS via both large language models (LLMs) and symbolic program synthesis, i.e., neural-symbolic synthesis. The key insight is leveraging the powerful code generation ability of LLM to make costly search-based symbolic synthesis computationally tractable. Concretely, we propose multiple LLM-assisted compilation passes via pre-defined meta-prompts for program transformation. During each program transformation, efficient symbolic program synthesis is employed to repair incorrect code snippets with a limited scale. To attain high performance, we propose a hierarchical auto-tuning approach to systematically explore both the parameters and sequences of transformation passes. Experiments on 4 DLS with distinct programming interfaces, i.e., Intel DL Boost with VNNI, NVIDIA GPU with CUDA, AMD MI with HIP, and Cambricon MLU with BANG, demonstrate that QiMeng-Xpiler correctly translates different tensor programs at the accuracy of 95% on average, and the performance of translated programs achieves up to 2.0x over vendor-provided manually-optimized libraries. As a result, the programming productivity of DLS is improved by up to 96.0x via transcompiling legacy tensor programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to OSDI 2025</p></details> |

One potential application of these models in the educational field would be to provide feedback to students in university introductory programming courses, so that a student struggling to solve a basic implementation problem could seek help from an LLM available 24/7. This article focuses on studying three aspects related to such an application. First, the performance of two well-known models, GPT-3.5T and GPT-4T, in providing feedback to students is evaluated. The empirical results showed that GPT-4T performs much better than GPT-3.5T, however, it is not yet ready for use in a real-world scenario. This is due to the possibility of generating incorrect information that potential users may not always be able to detect. Second, the article proposes a carefully designed prompt using in-context learning techniques that allows automating important parts of the evaluation process, as well as providing a lower bound for the fraction of feedbacks containing incorrect information, saving time and effort. This was possible because the resulting feedback has a programmatically analyzable structure that incorporates diagnostic information about the LLM's performance in solving the requested task. Third, the article also suggests a possible strategy for implementing a practical learning tool based on LLMs, which is rooted on the proposed prompting techniques. This strategy opens up a whole range of interesting possibilities from a pedagogical perspective.</p></details> |  |

Triton-distributed is the first compiler that supports native overlapping optimizations for distributed AI workloads, providing a good coverage of existing optimizations from different frameworks. First, we integrate communication primitives compliant with the OpenSHMEM standard into the compiler. This enables programmers to utilize these primitives with a higher-level Python programming model. Second, we illustrate how to achieve complex joint optimization of computation, memory access, and communication with the assistance of the compiler. In particular, we show how to use overlapping techniques to hide latency and present our compiler-based programming methods in both single-node and multi-node scenarios. Finally, we showcase the performance of the code generated by our compiler. In a test environment with up to 64 devices, our compiler can fully utilize heterogeneous communication and computation resources to provide effective overlapping and high performance. In many cases, the performance of the generated code can even outperform hand-optimized code. Moreover, the development difficulty and the time cost for development using our compiler are far less than those of low-level programming such as CUDA/C++, which clearly demonstrates significant productivity advantages.</p></details> |  |

Through critical analysis of both Kuhn's original framework and its application in computing, we argue that the contemporary usage of `programming paradigms' represents a significant departure from Kuhn's philosophical concept. We demonstrate that while Floyd explicitly attributed this term to Kuhn's work, his usage fundamentally altered the concept's meaning. We argue that this divergence necessitates a critical reassessment of the term's usage in computing discourse.</p></details> |  |

This technique can be applied to synthesize API composing scripts from logs of calls made to those APIs, or a script from traces of system calls made by a workload, for example. All of the provided traces are positive examples, meaning that they describe desired behavior. Our approach does not require negative examples. Instead, it generalizes over the examples and uses cost metrics to prevent over-generalization. Because the problem is too complex for traditional monolithic program synthesis techniques, we propose a new combination of optimizing rewrites and syntax-guided program synthesis. The resulting program is correct by construction, so its output will always be able to reproduce the input traces. We evaluate the quality of the programs synthesized when considering various optimization metrics and the synthesizer's efficiency on real-world benchmarks. The results show that our approach can generate useful real-world programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at PLDI 2025 (46th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation)</p></details> |

The product of these decisions forms a search space of programs which is typically intractably large. Existing approaches (e.g., auto-schedulers) often address this problem by sampling this space heuristically. In contrast, we introduce a dynamic-programming-based approach to explore more of the search space by iteratively decomposing large program specifications into smaller specifications reachable from a set of rewrites, then composing a final program from each rewrite that minimizes an affine cost model. To reduce memory requirements, we employ a novel memoization table representation, which indexes specifications by coordinates in $Z_{\geq 0}$ and compresses identical, adjacent solutions. This approach can visit a much larger set of programs than prior work. To evaluate the approach, we developed Morello, a compiler which lowers specifications roughly equivalent to a few-node XLA computation graph to x86. Notably, we found that an affine cost model is sufficient to surface high-throughput programs. For example, Morello synthesized a collection of matrix multiplication benchmarks targeting a Zen 1 CPU, including a 1x2048x16384, bfloat16-to-float32 vector-matrix multiply, which was integrated into Google's gemma.cpp.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Program Semantic Inequivalence Game with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03818v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) can achieve strong performance on everyday coding tasks, but they can fail on complex tasks that require non-trivial reasoning about program semantics. Finding training examples to teach LLMs to solve these tasks can be challenging. In this work, we explore a method to synthetically generate code reasoning training data based on a semantic inequivalence game SInQ: a generator agent creates program variants that are semantically distinct, derived from a dataset of real-world programming tasks, while an evaluator agent has to identify input examples that cause the original programs and the generated variants to diverge in their behaviour, with the agents training each other semi-adversarially. We prove that this setup enables theoretically unlimited improvement through self-play in the limit of infinite computational resources. We evaluated our approach on multiple code generation and understanding benchmarks, including cross-language vulnerability detection (Lu et al., 2021), where our method improves vulnerability detection in C/C++ code despite being trained exclusively on Python code, and the challenging Python builtin identifier swap benchmark (Miceli-Barone et al., 2023), showing that whereas modern LLMs still struggle with this benchmark, our approach yields substantial improvements. We release the code needed to replicate the experiments, as well as the generated synthetic data, which can be used to fine-tune LLMs.</p></details> |  |

These problems typically require domain knowledge, mathematical skills, and programming ability, presenting significant challenges for non-experts. This study explores the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating solver-specific LP code. We propose CHORUS, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for synthesizing Gurobi-based LP code from natural language problem statements. CHORUS incorporates a hierarchical tree-like chunking strategy for theoretical contents and generates additional metadata based on code examples from documentation to facilitate self-contained, semantically coherent retrieval. Two-stage retrieval approach of CHORUS followed by cross-encoder reranking further ensures contextual relevance. Finally, expertly crafted prompt and structured parser with reasoning steps improve code generation performance significantly. Experiments on the NL4Opt-Code benchmark show that CHORUS improves the performance of open-source LLMs such as Llama3.1 (8B), Llama3.3 (70B), Phi4 (14B), Deepseek-r1 (32B), and Qwen2.5-coder (32B) by a significant margin compared to baseline and conventional RAG. It also allows these open-source LLMs to outperform or match the performance of much stronger baselines-GPT3.5 and GPT4 while requiring far fewer computational resources.

Enhancing truck platoon formation in such a heterogeneous environment presents new challenges. This paper investigates the hub-based platoon coordination problem in a mixed truck fleet, where the focus is to optimize the trucks' waiting times, charging amounts for electric trucks, and platoon leader assignments. The objective is to maximize the overall platoon revenue of the fleet while accounting for the associated waiting and charging costs. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program and present a dynamic programming approach to compute its sub-optimal solution efficiently. The proposed method operates in polynomial time, ensuring scalable computational efficiency. Simulation studies involving 1,000 trucks traveling between two hubs in Sweden demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Affine Loops: A Geometric Approach to Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00620v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring software correctness remains a fundamental challenge in formal program verification. One promising approach relies on finding polynomial invariants for loops. Polynomial invariants are properties of a program loop that hold before and after each iteration. Generating polynomial invariants is a crucial task for loops, but it is an undecidable problem in the general case. Recently, an alternative approach to this problem has emerged, focusing on synthesizing loops from invariants. However, existing methods only synthesize affine loops without guard conditions from polynomial invariants. In this paper, we address a more general problem, allowing loops to have polynomial update maps with a given structure, inequations in the guard condition, and polynomial invariants of arbitrary form. In this paper, we use algebraic geometry tools to design and implement an algorithm that computes a finite set of polynomial equations whose solutions correspond to all loops satisfying the given polynomial invariants. In other words, we reduce the problem of synthesizing loops to finding solutions of polynomial systems within a specified subset of the complex numbers. The latter is handled in our software using an SMT solver.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integer linear programming for unsupervised training set selection in molecular machine learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16122v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integer linear programming (ILP) is an elegant approach to solve linear optimization problems, naturally described using integer decision variables. Within the context of physics-inspired machine learning applied to chemistry, we demonstrate the relevance of an ILP formulation to select molecular training sets for predictions of size-extensive properties. We show that our algorithm outperforms existing unsupervised training set selection approaches, especially when predicting properties of molecules larger than those present in the training set. We argue that the reason for the improved performance is due to the selection that is based on the notion of local similarity (i.e., per-atom) and a unique ILP approach that finds optimal solutions efficiently. Altogether, this work provides a practical algorithm to improve the performance of physics-inspired machine learning models and offers insights into the conceptual differences with existing training set selection approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages + SI (15 pages)</p></details> |
| **[The Development of Reflective Practice on a Work-Based Software Engineering Program: A Longitudinal Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20956v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study examines the development of reflective practice among students on a four-year work-based Software Engineering program. Using two established models of reflection - Boud et al.'s Model of Reflective Process and Bain et al.'s 5R Framework for Reflection - we analyse a series of reflective assignments submitted by students over four years. Our longitudinal analysis reveals clear trends in how students' reflective abilities evolve over the course of the program. We find that more sophisticated forms of reflection, such as integration of knowledge, appropriation of skills, and reconstruction of practice, increase markedly in prevalence in later years. The complementary nature of workplace experience and university study is highlighted in students' reflections, demonstrating a key benefit of the work-based learning approach. By the final year, all students demonstrate the ability to reconstruct their experiences to inform future practice. Our findings provide insight into how reflective practice develops in Software Engineering education and suggest potential value in incorporating more structured reflection into traditional degree programs. The study also reveals instances of meta-reflection, where students reflect on the value of reflection itself, indicating a deep engagement with the reflective process. While acknowledging limitations, this work offers a unique longitudinal perspective on the development of reflective practice in work-based Software Engineering education.</p></details> |  |
| **[PDCS: A Primal-Dual Large-Scale Conic Programming Solver with GPU Enhancements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00311v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the "Primal-Dual Conic Programming Solver" (PDCS), a large-scale conic programming solver with GPU enhancements. Problems that PDCS currently supports include linear programs, second-order cone programs, convex quadratic programs, and exponential cone programs. PDCS achieves scalability to large-scale problems by leveraging sparse matrix-vector multiplication as its core computational operation, which is both memory-efficient and well-suited for GPU acceleration. The solver is based on the restarted primal-dual hybrid gradient method but further incorporates several enhancements, including adaptive reflected Halpern restarts, adaptive step-size selection, adaptive weight adjustment, and diagonal rescaling. Additionally, PDCS employs a bijection-based method to compute projections onto rescaled cones. Furthermore, cuPDCS is a GPU implementation of PDCS and it implements customized computational schemes that utilize different levels of GPU architecture to handle cones of different types and sizes. Numerical experiments demonstrate that cuPDCS is generally more efficient than state-of-the-art commercial solvers and other first-order methods on large-scale conic program applications, including Fisher market equilibrium problems, Lasso regression, and multi-period portfolio optimization. Furthermore, cuPDCS also exhibits better scalability, efficiency, and robustness compared to other first-order methods on the conic program benchmark dataset CBLIB. These advantages are more pronounced in large-scale, lower-accuracy settings.</p></details> | 42 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Hexcute: A Tile-based Programming Language with Automatic Layout and Task-Mapping Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16214v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) workloads mainly run on accelerators like GPUs. Recent DL quantization techniques demand a new matrix multiplication operator with mixed input data types, further complicating GPU optimization. Prior high-level compilers like Triton lack the expressiveness to implement key optimizations like fine-grained data pipelines and hardware-friendly memory layouts for these operators, while low-level programming models, such as Hidet, Graphene, and CUTLASS, require significant programming efforts. To balance expressiveness with engineering effort, we propose Hexcute, a tile-based programming language that exposes shared memory and register abstractions to enable fine-grained optimization for these operators. Additionally, Hexcute leverages task mapping to schedule the GPU program, and to reduce programming efforts, it automates layout and task mapping synthesis with a novel type-inference-based algorithm. Our evaluation shows that Hexcute generalizes to a wide range of DL operators, achieves 1.7-11.28$\times$ speedup over existing DL compilers for mixed-type operators, and brings up to 2.91$\times$ speedup in the end-to-end evaluation.</p></details> | 17 pages, 24 figures |
| **[InvAASTCluster: On Applying Invariant-Based Program Clustering to Introductory Programming Assignments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14175v3)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the vast number of students enrolled in programming courses, there has been an increasing number of automated program repair techniques focused on introductory programming assignments (IPAs). Typically, such techniques use program clustering to take advantage of previous correct student implementations to repair a new incorrect submission. These repair techniques use clustering methods since analyzing all available correct submissions to repair a program is not feasible. However, conventional clustering methods rely on program representations based on features such as abstract syntax trees (ASTs), syntax, control flow, and data flow. This paper proposes InvAASTCluster, a novel approach for program clustering that uses dynamically generated program invariants to cluster semantically equivalent IPAs. InvAASTCluster's program representation uses a combination of the program's semantics, through its invariants, and its structure through its anonymized abstract syntax tree (AASTs). Invariants denote conditions that must remain true during program execution, while AASTs are ASTs devoid of variable and function names, retaining only their types. Our experiments show that the proposed program representation outperforms syntax-based representations when clustering a set of correct IPAs. Furthermore, we integrate InvAASTCluster into a state-of-the-art clustering-based program repair tool. Our results show that InvAASTCluster advances the current state-of-the-art when used by clustering-based repair tools by repairing around 13% more students' programs, in a shorter amount of time.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 21 Figures, 5 Tables.
