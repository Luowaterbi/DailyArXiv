| **[A Rate-Quality Model for Learned Video Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02720v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learned video coding (LVC) has recently achieved superior coding performance. In this paper, we model the rate-quality (R-Q) relationship for learned video coding by a parametric function. We learn a neural network, termed RQNet, to characterize the relationship between the bitrate and quality level according to video content and coding context. The predicted (R,Q) results are further integrated with those from previously coded frames using the least-squares method to determine the parameters of our R-Q model on-the-fly. Compared to the conventional approaches, our method accurately estimates the R-Q relationship, enabling the online adaptation of model parameters to enhance both flexibility and precision. Experimental results show that our R-Q model achieves significantly smaller bitrate deviations than the baseline method on commonly used datasets with minimal additional complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Human Judgements to Predictive Models: Unravelling Acceptability in Code-Mixed Sentences](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.05572v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current computational approaches for analysing or generating code-mixed sentences do not explicitly model ``naturalness'' or ``acceptability'' of code-mixed sentences, but rely on training corpora to reflect distribution of acceptable code-mixed sentences. Modelling human judgement for the acceptability of code-mixed text can help in distinguishing natural code-mixed text and enable quality-controlled generation of code-mixed text. To this end, we construct Cline - a dataset containing human acceptability judgements for English-Hindi~(en-hi) code-mixed text. Cline is the largest of its kind with 16,642 sentences, consisting of samples sourced from two sources: synthetically generated code-mixed text and samples collected from online social media. Our analysis establishes that popular code-mixing metrics such as CMI, Number of Switch Points, Burstines, which are used to filter/curate/compare code-mixed corpora have low correlation with human acceptability judgements, underlining the necessity of our dataset. Experiments using Cline demonstrate that simple Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) models when trained solely using code-mixing metrics as features are outperformed by fine-tuned pre-trained Multilingual Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically, among Encoder models XLM-Roberta and Bernice outperform IndicBERT across different configurations. Among Encoder-Decoder models, mBART performs better than mT5, however Encoder-Decoder models are not able to outperform Encoder-only models. Decoder-only models perform the best when compared to all other MLLMS, with Llama 3.2 - 3B models outperforming similarly sized Qwen, Phi models. Comparison with zero and fewshot capabilitites of ChatGPT show that MLLMs fine-tuned on larger data outperform ChatGPT, providing scope for improvement in code-mixed tasks. Zero-shot transfer from En-Hi to En-Te acceptability judgments are better than random baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Griesmer type bounds for additive codes over finite fields, integral and fractional MDS codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.08916v5)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article we prove Griesmer type bounds for additive codes over finite fields. These new bounds give upper bounds on the length of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes, codes which attain the Singleton bound. We will also consider codes to be MDS if they attain the fractional Singleton bound, due to Huffman. We prove that this bound in the fractional case can be obtained by codes whose length surpasses the length of the longest known codes in the integral case. For small parameters, we provide exhaustive computational results for additive MDS codes, by classifying the corresponding (fractional) subspace-arcs. This includes a complete classification of fractional additive MDS codes of size 243 over the field of order 9.</p></details> |  |
| **[Targeted Fuzzing for Unsafe Rust Code: Leveraging Selective Instrumentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02464v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rust is a promising programming language that focuses on concurrency, usability, and security. It is used in production code by major industry players and got recommended by government bodies. Rust provides strong security guarantees achieved by design utilizing the concepts of ownership and borrowing. However, Rust allows programmers to write unsafe code which is not subject to the strict Rust security policy. Empirical studies show that security issues in practice always involve code written in unsafe Rust. In this paper, we present the first approach that utilizes selective code coverage feedback to focus the fuzzing efforts on unsafe Rust code. Our approach significantly improves the efficiency when fuzzing Rust programs and does not require additional computational resources while fuzz testing the target. To quantify the impact of partial code instrumentation, we implement our approach by extending the capabilities of the Rust compiler toolchain. We present an automated approach to detect unsafe and safe code components to decide which parts of the program a fuzzer should focus on when running a fuzzing campaign to find vulnerabilities in Rust programs. Our approach is fully compatible with existing fuzzing implementations and does not require complex manual work, thus retaining the existing high usability standard. Focusing on unsafe code, our implementation allows us to generate inputs that trigger more unsafe code locations with statistical significance and therefore is able to detect potential vulnerabilities in a shorter time span while imposing no performance overhead during fuzzing itself.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted at the International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Integrating Symbolic Execution into the Fine-Tuning of Code-Generating LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15210v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code-generating Large Language Models (LLMs) have become essential tools in modern software development, enhancing productivity and accelerating development. This paper aims to investigate the fine-tuning of code-generating LLMs using Reinforcement Learning and Direct Preference Optimization, further improving their performance. To achieve this, we enhance the training data for the reward model with the help of symbolic execution techniques, ensuring more comprehensive and objective data. With symbolic execution, we create a custom dataset that better captures the nuances in code evaluation. Our reward models, fine-tuned on this dataset, demonstrate significant improvements over the baseline, CodeRL, in estimating the quality of generated code. Our code-generating LLMs, trained with the help of reward model feedback, achieve similar results compared to the CodeRL benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Slicing-Based Approach for Detecting and Patching Vulnerable Code Clones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02349v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code cloning is a common practice in software development, but it poses significant security risks by propagating vulnerabilities across cloned segments. To address this challenge, we introduce srcVul, a scalable, precise detection approach that combines program slicing with Locality-Sensitive Hashing to identify vulnerable code clones and recommend patches. srcVul builds a database of vulnerability-related slices by analyzing known vulnerable programs and their corresponding patches, indexing each slice's unique structural characteristics as a vulnerability slicing vector. During clone detection, srcVul efficiently matches slicing vectors from target programs with those in the database, recommending patches upon identifying similarities. Our evaluation of srcVul against three state-of-the-art vulnerable clone detectors demonstrates its accuracy, efficiency, and scalability, achieving 91% precision and 75% recall on established vulnerability databases and open-source repositories. These results highlight srcVul's effectiveness in detecting complex vulnerability patterns across diverse codebases.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Empirical Study on the Performance and Energy Usage of Compiled Python Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02346v1)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Python is a popular programming language known for its ease of learning and extensive libraries. However, concerns about performance and energy consumption have led to the development of compilers to enhance Python code efficiency. Despite the proven benefits of existing compilers on the efficiency of Python code, there is limited analysis comparing their performance and energy efficiency, particularly considering code characteristics and factors like CPU frequency and core count. Our study investigates how compilation impacts the performance and energy consumption of Python code, using seven benchmarks compiled with eight different tools: PyPy, Numba, Nuitka, Mypyc, Codon, Cython, Pyston-lite, and the experimental Python 3.13 version, compared to CPython. The benchmarks are single-threaded and executed on an NUC and a server, measuring energy usage, execution time, memory usage, and Last-Level Cache (LLC) miss rates at a fixed frequency and on a single core. The results show that compilation can significantly enhance execution time, energy and memory usage, with Codon, PyPy, and Numba achieving over 90\% speed and energy improvements. Nuitka optimizes memory usage consistently on both testbeds. The impact of compilation on LLC miss rate is not clear since it varies considerably across benchmarks for each compiler. Our study is important for researchers and practitioners focused on improving Python code performance and energy efficiency. We outline future research directions, such as exploring caching effects on energy usage. Our findings help practitioners choose the best compiler based on their efficiency benefits and accessibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[LASSI: An LLM-based Automated Self-Correcting Pipeline for Translating Parallel Scientific Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01638v2)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the problem of providing a novel approach to sourcing significant training data for LLMs focused on science and engineering. In particular, a crucial challenge is sourcing parallel scientific codes in the ranges of millions to billions of codes. To tackle this problem, we propose an automated pipeline framework called LASSI, designed to translate between parallel programming languages by bootstrapping existing closed- or open-source LLMs. LASSI incorporates autonomous enhancement through self-correcting loops where errors encountered during the compilation and execution of generated code are fed back to the LLM through guided prompting for debugging and refactoring. We highlight the bi-directional translation of existing GPU benchmarks between OpenMP target offload and CUDA to validate LASSI. The results of evaluating LASSI with different application codes across four LLMs demonstrate the effectiveness of LASSI for generating executable parallel codes, with 80% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 85% of CUDA to OpenMP translations producing the expected output. We also observe approximately 78% of OpenMP to CUDA translations and 62% of CUDA to OpenMP translations execute within 10% of or at a faster runtime than the original benchmark code in the same language.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging LLMs to Automate Energy-Aware Refactoring of Parallel Scientific Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02184v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for generating parallel scientific code, most current efforts emphasize functional correctness, often overlooking performance and energy considerations. In this work, we propose LASSI-EE, an automated LLM-based refactoring framework that generates energy-efficient parallel code on a target parallel system for a given parallel code as input. Through a multi-stage, iterative pipeline process, LASSI-EE achieved an average energy reduction of 47% across 85% of the 20 HeCBench benchmarks tested on NVIDIA A100 GPUs. Our findings demonstrate the broader potential of LLMs, not only for generating correct code but also for enabling energy-aware programming. We also address key insights and limitations within the framework, offering valuable guidance for future improvements.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Dihedral Quantum Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.15092v3)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We establish dihedral quantum codes of short block length, a class of CSS codes obtained by the lifted product construction. We present the code construction and give a formula for the code dimension, depending on the two classical codes that the CSS code is based on. We also give a lower bound on the code distance and construct an example of short dihedral quantum codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM Code Generation: A Systematic Evaluation of Multi-Agent Collaboration and Runtime Debugging for Improved Accuracy, Reliability, and Latency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02133v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of large language models (LLMs) for automated code generation has emerged as a significant focus within AI research. As these pretrained models continue to evolve, their ability to understand and generate complex code structures has opened new possibilities for automating intricate programming tasks for the sake of accurate code generation. Although contemporary foundational models demonstrate promoting results, researchers continue to explore optimal post-training strategies to enhance code quality. These include supervised fine-tuning, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), debugging, and many others. In this paper, we combine two widely used approaches namely multi-agent collaboration and runtime execution information-based debugging, for improving code generation functionality, reliability, and practical applicability. We perform an empirical study in order to extend the evaluation of the individual strategies as well as the proposed composition of the activities of both strategies. Our study use 19 LLMs to examines the performance of individual and the proposed strategies, offering comprehensive insights into how different programming activities compositions and training paradigms influence code generation effectiveness. In particular, we implement a chained system that combines both strategies to assess their combined impact on functional accuracy, code reliability, and generation latency using two benchmark datasets commonly used for code generation. Our findings provide valuable insights for organizations seeking robust AI-driven coding solutions by guiding them in selecting models that can better adapt to complex post-training strategies, ultimately fostering the adoption of more effective and reliable code generation technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Code Transceiver Design for Unsourced Random Access with Analytical Power Division in Gaussian MAC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01988v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we discuss the problem of unsourced random access (URA) over a Gaussian multiple access channel (GMAC). To address the challenges posed by emerging massive machine-type connectivity, URA reframes multiple access as a coding-theoretic problem. The sparse code-oriented schemes are highly valued because they are widely used in existing protocols, making their implementation require only minimal changes to current networks. However, drawbacks such as the heavy reliance on extrinsic feedback from powerful channel codes and the lack of transmission robustness pose obstacles to the development of sparse codes. To address these drawbacks, a novel sparse code structure based on a universally applicable power division strategy is proposed. Comprehensive numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed scheme. Specifically, by employing the proposed power division method, which is derived analytically and does not require extensive simulations, a performance improvement of approximately 2.8 dB is achieved compared to schemes with identical channel code setups.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainability by design: an experimental analysis of the legal coding process](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01944v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Behind a set of rules in Deontic Defeasible Logic, there is a mapping process of normative background fragments. This process goes from text to rules and implicitly encompasses an explanation of the coded fragments. In this paper we deliver a methodology for \textit{legal coding} that starts with a fragment and goes onto a set of Deontic Defeasible Logic rules, involving a set of \textit{scenarios} to test the correctness of the coded fragments. The methodology is illustrated by the coding process of an example text. We then show the results of a series of experiments conducted with humans encoding a variety of normative backgrounds and corresponding cases in which we have measured the efforts made in the coding process, as related to some measurable features. To process these examples, a recently developed technology, Houdini, that allows reasoning in Deontic Defeasible Logic, has been employed. Finally we provide a technique to forecast time required in coding, that depends on factors such as knowledge of the legal domain, knowledge of the coding processes, length of the text, and a measure of \textit{depth} that refers to the length of the paths of legal references.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explicit Construction of Quantum Quasi-Cyclic Low-Density Parity-Check Codes with Column Weight 2 and Girth 12](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13444v2)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study proposes an explicit construction method for quantum quasi-cyclic low-density parity-check (QC-LDPC) codes with a girth of 12. The proposed method designs parity-check matrices that maximize the girth while maintaining an orthogonal structure suitable for quantum error correction. By utilizing algebraic techniques, short cycles are eliminated, which improves error correction performance. Additionally, this method is extended to non-binary LDPC codes and spatially-coupled LDPC codes, demonstrating that both the girth and orthogonality can be preserved. The results of this study enable the design of high-performance quantum error-correcting codes without the need for random search.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 fugure, 1 table</p></details> |
| **[CoDe: Blockwise Control for Denoising Diffusion Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.00968v2)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Aligning diffusion models to downstream tasks often requires finetuning new models or gradient-based guidance at inference time to enable sampling from the reward-tilted posterior. In this work, we explore a simple inference-time gradient-free guidance approach, called controlled denoising (CoDe), that circumvents the need for differentiable guidance functions and model finetuning. CoDe is a blockwise sampling method applied during intermediate denoising steps, allowing for alignment with downstream rewards. Our experiments demonstrate that, despite its simplicity, CoDe offers a favorable trade-off between reward alignment, prompt instruction following, and inference cost, achieving a competitive performance against the state-of-the-art baselines. Our code is available at: https://github.com/anujinho/code.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Defect Taxonomy for Infrastructure as Code: A Replication Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01568v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: As Infrastructure as Code (IaC) becomes standard practice, ensuring the reliability of IaC scripts is essential. Defect taxonomies are valuable tools for this, offering a common language for issues and enabling systematic tracking. A significant prior study developed such a taxonomy, but based it exclusively on the declarative language Puppet. It remained unknown whether this taxonomy applies to programming language-based IaC (PL-IaC) tools like Pulumi, Terraform CDK, and AWS CDK. Aim: We replicated this foundational work to assess the generalizability of the taxonomy across a broader and more diverse landscape. Method: We performed qualitative analysis on 3,364 defect-related commits from 285 open-source PL-IaC repositories (PIPr dataset) to derive a PL-IaC-specific defect taxonomy. We then enhanced the ACID tool, originally developed for the prior study, to automatically classify and analyze defect distributions across an expanded dataset-447 open-source repositories and 94 proprietary projects from VTEX (e-commerce) and Nubank (financial). Results: Our research confirmed the same eight defect categories identified in the original study, with idempotency and security defects appearing infrequently but persistently across projects. Configuration Data defects maintain high frequency in both open-source and proprietary codebases. Conclusions: Our replication supports the generalizability of the original taxonomy, suggesting IaC development challenges surpass organizational boundaries. Configuration Data defects emerge as a persistent high-frequency problem, while idempotency and security defects remain important concerns despite lower frequency. These patterns appear consistent across open-source and proprietary projects, indicating they are fundamental to the IaC paradigm itself, transcending specific tools or project types.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[CHORUS: Zero-shot Hierarchical Retrieval and Orchestration for Generating Linear Programming Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01485v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear Programming (LP) problems aim to find the optimal solution to an objective under constraints. These problems typically require domain knowledge, mathematical skills, and programming ability, presenting significant challenges for non-experts. This study explores the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating solver-specific LP code. We propose CHORUS, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for synthesizing Gurobi-based LP code from natural language problem statements. CHORUS incorporates a hierarchical tree-like chunking strategy for theoretical contents and generates additional metadata based on code examples from documentation to facilitate self-contained, semantically coherent retrieval. Two-stage retrieval approach of CHORUS followed by cross-encoder reranking further ensures contextual relevance. Finally, expertly crafted prompt and structured parser with reasoning steps improve code generation performance significantly. Experiments on the NL4Opt-Code benchmark show that CHORUS improves the performance of open-source LLMs such as Llama3.1 (8B), Llama3.3 (70B), Phi4 (14B), Deepseek-r1 (32B), and Qwen2.5-coder (32B) by a significant margin compared to baseline and conventional RAG. It also allows these open-source LLMs to outperform or match the performance of much stronger baselines-GPT3.5 and GPT4 while requiring far fewer computational resources. Ablation studies further demonstrate the importance of expert prompting, hierarchical chunking, and structured reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the 19th Learning and Intelligent Optimization Conference (LION 19)</p></details> |
| **[BiGSCoder: State Space Model for Code Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01475v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present BiGSCoder, a novel encoder-only bidirectional state-space model (SSM) featuring a gated architecture, pre-trained for code understanding on a code dataset using masked language modeling. Our work aims to systematically evaluate SSMs' capabilities in coding tasks compared to traditional transformer architectures; BiGSCoder is built for this purpose. Through comprehensive experiments across diverse pre-training configurations and code understanding benchmarks, we demonstrate that BiGSCoder outperforms transformer-based models, despite utilizing simpler pre-training strategies and much less training data. Our results indicate that BiGSCoder can serve as a more sample-efficient alternative to conventional transformer models. Furthermore, our study shows that SSMs perform better without positional embeddings and can effectively extrapolate to longer sequences during fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Micro-Patterns in Solidity Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01282v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solidity is the predominant programming language for blockchain-based smart contracts, and its characteristics pose significant challenges for code analysis and maintenance. Traditional software analysis approaches, while effective for conventional programming languages, often fail to address Solidity-specific features such as gas optimization and security constraints. This paper introduces micro-patterns - recurring, small-scale design structures that capture key behavioral and structural peculiarities specific to a language - for Solidity language and demonstrates their value in understanding smart contract development practices. We identified 18 distinct micro-patterns organized in five categories (Security, Functional, Optimization, Interaction, and Feedback), detailing their characteristics to enable automated detection. To validate this proposal, we analyzed a dataset of 23258 smart contracts from five popular blockchains (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum, Fantom and Optimism). Our analysis reveals widespread adoption of micro-patterns, with 99% of contracts implementing at least one pattern and an average of 2.76 patterns per contract. The Storage Saver pattern showed the highest adoption (84.62% mean coverage), while security patterns demonstrated platform-specific adoption rates. Statistical analysis revealed significant platform-specific differences in pattern adoption, particularly in Borrower, Implementer, and Storage Optimization patterns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Coded Caching for Partially Connected Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13298v3)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coded caching leverages the differences in user cache memories to achieve gains that scale with the total cache size, alleviating network congestion due to high-quality content requests. Additionally, distributing transmitters over a wide area can mitigate the adverse effects of path loss. In this work, we consider a partially connected network where the channel between distributed transmitters (helpers) and users is modeled as a distributed multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) Gaussian broadcast channel. We propose a novel delivery scheme consisting of two phases: partitioning and transmission. In the partitioning phase, users with identical cache profiles are partitioned into the minimum number of sets, such that users within each set can successfully decode their desired message from a joint transmission enabled by MIMO precoding. To optimally partition the users, we employ the branch and bound method. In the transmission phase, each partition is treated as a single entity, and codewords are multicast to partitions with distinct cache profiles. The proposed delivery scheme is applicable to any partially connected network, and while the partitioning is optimal, the overall delivery scheme, including transmission, is heuristic. Interestingly, simulation results show that its performance closely approximates that of the fully connected optimal solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting the Root Cause Code Lines in Bug-Fixing Commits by Heterogeneous Graph Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01022v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the continuous growth in the scale and complexity of software systems, defect remediation has become increasingly difficult and costly. Automated defect prediction tools can proactively identify software changes prone to defects within software projects, thereby enhancing software development efficiency. However, existing work in heterogeneous and complex software projects continues to face challenges, such as struggling with heterogeneous commit structures and ignoring cross-line dependencies in code changes, which ultimately reduce the accuracy of defect identification. To address these challenges, we propose an approach called RC_Detector. RC_Detector comprises three main components: the bug-fixing graph construction component, the code semantic aggregation component, and the cross-line semantic retention component. The bug-fixing graph construction component identifies the code syntax structures and program dependencies within bug-fixing commits and transforms them into heterogeneous graph formats by converting the source code into vector representations. The code semantic aggregation component adapts to heterogeneous data by using heterogeneous attention to learn the hidden semantic representation of target code lines. The cross-line semantic retention component regulates propagated semantic information by using attenuation and reinforcement gates derived from old and new code semantic representations, effectively preserving cross-line semantic relationships. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of our model by collecting data from 87 open-source projects, including 675 bug-fixing commits. The experimental results demonstrate that our model outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, achieving significant improvements of 83.15%,96.83%,78.71%,74.15%,54.14%,91.66%,91.66%, and 34.82% in MFR, respectively, compared with the state-of-the-art approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Identifying Root Cause of bugs by Capturing Changed Code Lines with Relational Graph Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00990v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Just-In-Time defect prediction model helps development teams improve software quality and efficiency by assessing whether code changes submitted by developers are likely to introduce defects in real-time, allowing timely identification of potential issues during the commit stage. However, two main challenges exist in current work due to the reality that all deleted and added lines in bug-fixing commits may be related to the root cause of the introduced bug: 1) lack of effective integration of heterogeneous graph information, and 2) lack of semantic relationships between changed code lines. To address these challenges, we propose a method called RC-Detection, which utilizes relational graph convolutional network to capture the semantic relationships between changed code lines. RC-Detection is used to detect root-cause deletion lines in changed code lines, thereby identifying the root cause of introduced bugs in bug-fixing commits. To evaluate the effectiveness of RC-Detection, we used three datasets that contain high-quality bug-fixing and bug-introducing commits. Extensive experiments were conducted to evaluate the performance of our model by collecting data from 87 open-source projects, including 675 bug-fix commits. The experimental results show that, compared to the most advanced root cause detection methods, RC-Detection improved Recall@1, Recall@2, Recall@3, and MFR by at 4.107%, 5.113%, 4.289%, and 24.536%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Worst-Case Complexity of Gibbs Decoding for Reed--Muller Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00974v1)** | 2025-05-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reed--Muller (RM) codes are known to achieve capacity on binary symmetric channels (BSC) under the Maximum a Posteriori (MAP) decoder. However, it remains an open problem to design a capacity achieving polynomial-time RM decoder. Due to a lemma by Liu, Cuff, and Verd\'u, it can be shown that decoding by sampling from the posterior distribution is also capacity-achieving for RM codes over BSC. The Gibbs decoder is one such Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) based method, which samples from the posterior distribution by flipping message bits according to the posterior, and can be modified to give other MCMC decoding methods. In this paper, we analyze the mixing time of the Gibbs decoder for RM codes. Our analysis reveals that the Gibbs decoder can exhibit slow mixing for certain carefully constructed sequences. This slow mixing implies that, in the worst-case scenario, the decoder requires super-polynomial time to converge to the desired posterior distribution.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Language Perspective on the Robustness of LLM Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19108v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have gained significant traction and popularity in recent times, extending their usage to code-generation tasks. While this field has garnered considerable attention, the exploration of testing and evaluating the robustness of code generation models remains an ongoing endeavor. Previous studies have primarily focused on code generation models specifically for the Python language, overlooking other widely used programming languages. In this research, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis to assess the robustness performance of several prominent code generation models. Furthermore, we investigate how their performance varies across different programming languages. To accomplish this, we introduce perturbations in four key areas of the prompt: DocString, function name, syntax, and format. We have compiled and released a dedicated dataset for this purpose. This work presents our experimental findings, shedding light on the performance of code generation models in various scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[ICQuant: Index Coding enables Low-bit LLM Quantization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00850v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid deployment of Large Language Models (LLMs) highlights the need for efficient low-bit post-training quantization (PTQ), due to their high memory costs. A key challenge in weight quantization is the presence of outliers, which inflate quantization ranges and lead to large errors. While a number of outlier suppression techniques have been proposed, they either: fail to effectively shrink the quantization range, or incur (relatively) high bit overhead. In this paper, we present ICQuant, a novel framework that leverages outlier statistics to design an efficient index coding scheme for outlier-aware weight-only quantization. Compared to existing outlier suppression techniques requiring $\approx 1$ bit overhead to halve the quantization range, ICQuant requires only $\approx 0.3$ bits; a significant saving in extreme compression regimes (e.g., 2-3 bits per weight). ICQuant can be used on top of any existing quantizers to eliminate outliers, improving the quantization quality. Using just 2.3 bits per weight and simple scalar quantizers, ICQuant improves the zero-shot accuracy of the 2-bit Llama3-70B model by up to 130% and 150% relative to QTIP and QuIP#; and it achieves comparable performance to the best-known fine-tuned quantizer (PV-tuning) without fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Error Exponents for Oblivious Relaying and Connections to Source Coding with a Helper](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00567v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The information bottleneck channel, also known as oblivious relaying, is a two-hop channel where a transmitter sends messages to a remote receiver via an intermediate relay node. A codeword sent by the transmitter passes through a discrete memoryless channel to reach the relay, and then the relay processes the noisy channel output and forwards it to the receiver through a noiseless rate-limited link. The relay is oblivious, in the sense that it has no knowledge of the channel codebook used in transmission. Past works on oblivious relaying are focused on characterizing achievable rates. In this work, we study error exponents and explore connections to loseless source coding with a helper, also known as the Wyner-Ahlswede-K\"orner (WAK) problem. We first establish an achievable error exponent for oblivious relaying under constant compositions codes. A key feature of our analysis is the use of the type covering lemma to design the relay's compress-forward scheme. We then show that employing constant composition code ensembles does not improve the rates achieved with their IID counterparts. We also derive a sphere packing upper bound for the error exponent. In the second part of this paper, we establish a connection between the information bottleneck channel and the WAK problem. We show that good codes for the latter can be produced through permuting codes designed for the former. This is accomplished by revisiting Ahlswede's covering lemma, and extending it to achieve simultaneous covering of a type class by several distinct sets using the same sequence of permutations. We then apply our approach to attain the best known achievable error exponent for the WAK problem, previously established by Kelly and Wagner. As a byproduct of our derivations, we also establish error exponents and achievable rates under mismatched decoding rules.</p></details> |  |

We study this probability under independent and identically distributed (i.i.d.) substitution errors, focusing on a common code design strategy that combines inner and outer MDS codes. Our analysis demonstrates how this probability depends on factors such as the total number of sequencing reads, their distribution across strands, the rates of the inner and outer codes, and the substitution error probabilities. These results provide actionable insights into optimizing DNA storage systems under reliability constraints, including determining the minimum number of sequencing reads needed for reliable data retrieval and identifying the optimal balance between the rates of inner and outer MDS codes.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A shorter version of this paper has been accepted for presentation at ISIT 2025</p></details> |

With the help of common zero (CZ) set, we characterize 2-D constacyclic codes. Further, we provide an algorithm to construct an ideal basis of these codes by using their essential common zero (ECZ) sets. We describe the dual of 2-D constacyclic codes. Finally, we provide an encoding scheme for generating 2-D constacyclic codes. We present an example to illustrate that 2-D constacyclic codes can have better minimum distance compared to their cyclic counterparts with the same code area and code rate.</p></details> | 25 pages, 1 figure |
| **[CICADA: Cross-Domain Interpretable Coding for Anomaly Detection and Adaptation in Multivariate Time Series](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00415v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unsupervised Time series anomaly detection plays a crucial role in applications across industries. However, existing methods face significant challenges due to data distributional shifts across different domains, which are exacerbated by the non-stationarity of time series over time. Existing models fail to generalize under multiple heterogeneous source domains and emerging unseen new target domains. To fill the research gap, we introduce CICADA (Cross-domain Interpretable Coding for Anomaly Detection and Adaptation), with four key innovations: (1) a mixture of experts (MOE) framework that captures domain-agnostic anomaly features with high flexibility and interpretability; (2) a novel selective meta-learning mechanism to prevent negative transfer between dissimilar domains, (3) an adaptive expansion algorithm for emerging heterogeneous domain expansion, and (4) a hierarchical attention structure that quantifies expert contributions during fusion to enhance interpretability further.Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world industrial datasets demonstrate that CICADA outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both cross-domain detection performance and interpretability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing the Security of Semantic Communication via Knowledge-Aided Coding and Jamming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16960v2)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As semantic communication (SemCom) emerges as a promising communication paradigm, ensuring the security of semantic information over open wireless channels has become crucial. Traditional encryption methods introduce considerable communication overhead, while existing learning-based secure SemCom schemes often rely on a channel capacity advantage for the legitimate receiver, which is challenging to guarantee in practice. In this paper, we propose a coding-enhanced jamming approach that eliminates the need to transmit a secret key by utilizing shared knowledge between the legitimate receiver and the transmitter. We generate private codebooks with neural network (NN)-based encoders, using them to encode data into a sequence Y1, which is then superposed with a sequence Y2 drawn from the private codebook. By optimizing the power allocation between the two sequences, the legitimate receiver can successfully decode the data, while the eavesdropper' s performance is significantly degraded, potentially to the point of random guessing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves comparable security to state-of-the-art approaches while significantly improving the reconstruction performance of the legitimate receiver by more than 1 dB across varying channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and compression ratios.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents ReasoningV, a novel model employing a hybrid reasoning strategy that integrates trained intrinsic capabilities with dynamic inference adaptation for Verilog code generation. Our framework introduces three complementary innovations: (1) ReasoningV-5K, a high-quality dataset of 5,000 functionally verified instances with reasoning paths created through multi-dimensional filtering of PyraNet samples; (2) a two-stage training approach combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning for foundational knowledge with full-parameter optimization for enhanced reasoning; and (3) an adaptive reasoning mechanism that dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on problem complexity, reducing token consumption by up to 75\% while preserving performance. Experimental results demonstrate ReasoningV's effectiveness with a pass@1 accuracy of 57.8\% on VerilogEval-human, achieving performance competitive with leading commercial models like Gemini-2.0-flash (59.5\%) and exceeding the previous best open-source model by 10.4 percentage points.

While existing benchmarks evaluate the correctness and efficiency of LLM-generated code, the potential linguistic bias - where code quality varies based on the natural language used to describe programming tasks - remains underexplored. In this paper, we aim to investigate this linguistic bias through the lens of English and Chinese. To facilitate our investigation, we present a unified evaluation framework comprising a curated dataset of 52 Python programming questions with parallel bilingual task descriptions, automated correctness verification, and efficiency quantification tools based on runtime complexity estimation. Based on this framework, we conduct the first empirical study towards the linguistic bias in LLM-generated code on eight popular LCGMs, as well as GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4. We observe that these LCGM-generated code show different correctness on an average of 12% bilingual programming tasks, where 39% also exhibits diverse efficiency. Our findings indicate that LLMs commonly exhibit linguistic bias for code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Empirical Evaluation of Progressive Coding for Sparse Autoencoders](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00190v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse autoencoders (SAEs) \citep{bricken2023monosemanticity,gao2024scalingevaluatingsparseautoencoders} rely on dictionary learning to extract interpretable features from neural networks at scale in an unsupervised manner, with applications to representation engineering and information retrieval. SAEs are, however, computationally expensive \citep{lieberum2024gemmascopeopensparse}, especially when multiple SAEs of different sizes are needed. We show that dictionary importance in vanilla SAEs follows a power law. We compare progressive coding based on subset pruning of SAEs -- to jointly training nested SAEs, or so-called {\em Matryoshka} SAEs \citep{bussmann2024learning,nabeshima2024Matryoshka} -- on a language modeling task. We show Matryoshka SAEs exhibit lower reconstruction loss and recaptured language modeling loss, as well as higher representational similarity. Pruned vanilla SAEs are more interpretable, however. We discuss the origins and implications of this trade-off.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Efficacy of the Peeling Decoder for the Quantum Expander Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21845v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of recovering from qubit erasures has recently gained attention as erasures occur in many physical systems such as photonic systems, trapped ions, superconducting qubits and circuit quantum electrodynamics. While several linear-time decoders for error correction are known, their error-correcting capability is limited to half the minimum distance of the code, whereas erasure correction allows one to go beyond this limit. As in the classical case, stopping sets pose a major challenge in designing efficient erasure decoders for quantum LDPC codes. In this paper, we show through simulation, that an attractive alternative here, is the use of quantum expander codes in conjunction with the peeling decoder that has linear complexity. We also discuss additional techniques including small-set-flip decoding, that can be applied following the peeling operation, to improve decoding performance and their associated complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enumeration of minimum weight codewords of affine Cartesian codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21816v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Affine Cartesian codes were first discussed by Geil and Thomsen in 2013 in a broader framework and were formally introduced by L\'opez, Renter\'ia-M\'arquez and Villarreal in 2014. These are linear error-correcting codes obtained by evaluating polynomials at points of a Cartesian product of subsets of the given finite field. They can be viewed as a vast generalization of Reed-Muller codes. In 1970, Delsarte, Goethals and MacWilliams gave a %characterization of minimum weight codewords of Reed-Muller codes and also formula for the minimum weight codewords of Reed-Muller codes. Carvalho and Neumann in 2020 considered affine Cartesian codes in a special setting where the subsets in the Cartesian product are nested subfields of the given finite field, and gave a characterization of their minimum weight codewords. We use this to give an explicit formula for the number of minimum weight codewords of affine Cartesian codes in the case of nested subfields. This is seen to unify the known formulas for the number of minimum weight codewords of Reed-Solomon codes and Reed-Muller codes.</p></details> | 31 pages |
| **[An Empirical Study on the Effectiveness of Large Language Models for Binary Code Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21803v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary code analysis plays a pivotal role in the field of software security and is widely used in tasks such as software maintenance, malware detection, software vulnerability discovery, patch analysis, etc. However, unlike source code, reverse engineers face significant challenges in understanding binary code due to the lack of intuitive semantic information. Although traditional reverse tools can convert binary code into C-like pseudo code, the lack of code comments and symbolic information such as function names still makes code understanding difficult. In recent years, two groups of techniques have shown promising prospects: (1) Deep learning-based techniques have demonstrated competitive results in tasks related to binary code understanding, furthermore, (2) Large Language Models (LLMs) have been extensively pre-trained at the source-code level for tasks such as code understanding and generation. This has left participants wondering about the capabilities of LLMs in binary code understanding. To this end, this work proposes a benchmark to evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in real-world reverse engineering scenarios, which covers two key binary code understanding tasks, i.e., function name recovery and binary code summarization. To more comprehensively evaluate, we include binaries with multiple target architectures as well as different optimization options. We gain valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations through extensive empirical studies of popular LLMs using our benchmark. Our evaluations reveal that existing LLMs can understand binary code to a certain extent, thereby improving the efficiency of binary code analysis. Our results highlight the great potential of the LLMs in advancing the field of binary code understanding, and provide new directions for binary code analysis techniques.</p></details> | 38 pages, 9 figures |

We term this iterative, multi-turn process codeflow and introduce CodeFlowBench, the first benchmark designed for comprehensively evaluating LLMs' ability to perform codeflow, namely to implement new functionality by reusing existing functions over multiple turns. CodeFlowBench comprises 5258 problems drawn from Codeforces and is continuously updated via an automated pipeline that decomposes each problem into a series of function-level subproblems based on its dependency tree and each subproblem is paired with unit tests. We further propose a novel evaluation framework with tasks and metrics tailored to multi-turn code reuse to assess model performance. In experiments across various LLMs under both multi-turn and single-turn patterns. We observe models' poor performance on CodeFlowBench, with a substantial performance drop in the iterative codeflow scenario. For instance, o1-mini achieves a pass@1 of 20.8% in multi-turn pattern versus 37.8% in single-turn pattern. Further analysis shows that different models excel at different dependency depths, yet all struggle to correctly solve structurally complex problems, highlighting challenges for current LLMs to serve as code generation tools when performing codeflow. Overall, CodeFlowBench offers a comprehensive benchmark and new insights into LLM capabilities for multi-turn, iterative code generation, guiding future advances in code generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unit Proofing Framework for Code-level Verification: A Research Agenda](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.14818v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal verification provides mathematical guarantees that a software is correct. Design-level verification tools ensure software specifications are correct, but they do not expose defects in actual implementations. For this purpose, engineers use code-level tools. However, such tools struggle to scale to large software. The process of "Unit Proofing" mitigates this by decomposing the software and verifying each unit independently. We examined AWS's use of unit proofing and observed that current approaches are manual and prone to faults that mask severe defects. We propose a research agenda for a unit proofing framework, both methods and tools, to support software engineers in applying unit proofing effectively and efficiently. This will enable engineers to discover code-level defects early.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |
| **[WARP-LCA: Efficient Convolutional Sparse Coding with Locally Competitive Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18794v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The locally competitive algorithm (LCA) can solve sparse coding problems across a wide range of use cases. Recently, convolution-based LCA approaches have been shown to be highly effective for enhancing robustness for image recognition tasks in vision pipelines. To additionally maximize representational sparsity, LCA with hard-thresholding can be applied. While this combination often yields very good solutions satisfying an $\ell_0$ sparsity criterion, it comes with significant drawbacks for practical application: (i) LCA is very inefficient, typically requiring hundreds of optimization cycles for convergence; (ii) the use of hard-thresholding results in a non-convex loss function, which might lead to suboptimal minima. To address these issues, we propose the Locally Competitive Algorithm with State Warm-up via Predictive Priming (WARP-LCA), which leverages a predictor network to provide a suitable initial guess of the LCA state based on the current input. Our approach significantly improves both convergence speed and the quality of solutions, while maintaining and even enhancing the overall strengths of LCA. We demonstrate that WARP-LCA converges faster by orders of magnitude and reaches better minima compared to conventional LCA. Moreover, the learned representations are more sparse and exhibit superior properties in terms of reconstruction and denoising quality as well as robustness when applied in deep recognition pipelines. Furthermore, we apply WARP-LCA to image denoising tasks, showcasing its robustness and practical effectiveness. Our findings confirm that the naive use of LCA with hard-thresholding results in suboptimal minima, whereas initializing LCA with a predictive guess results in better outcomes. This research advances the field of biologically inspired deep learning by providing a novel approach to convolutional sparse coding.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, for the sequence defined by f(n) = ((1/2)^n + (-1)^n) / n, we prove that the combination [(n-2)f(n-2) + (n-3)f(n-3)] / [n f(n) + (n-1)f(n-1)] is universally equal to 4 for all integers n >= 4. This invariant bridge across four points opens new possibilities for predictive coding, data compression, and error detection. We demonstrate how the relation can be used to reconstruct missing data, verify data integrity, and reduce redundancy in data streams with minimal computational overhead. The simplicity and universality of this invariant make it a promising tool for a wide range of applications in information theory and coding systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, submitted to arXiv</p></details> |

Existing coding benchmarks are insufficient as they do not reflect the context and complexity of safety-critical applications. To this end, we assessed six LLMs' abilities to generate the code for three different path-planning algorithms and tested them on three maps of various difficulties. Our results suggest that LLM-generated code presents serious hazards for path planning applications and should not be applied in safety-critical contexts without rigorous testing.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we introduce 4DGS-CC, a contextual coding framework that compresses 4DGS data to meet specific storage constraints. Building upon the established deformable 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) method, our approach decomposes 4DGS data into 4D neural voxels and a canonical 3DGS component, which are then compressed using Neural Voxel Contextual Coding (NVCC) and Vector Quantization Contextual Coding (VQCC), respectively. Specifically, we first decompose the 4D neural voxels into distinct quantized features by separating the temporal and spatial dimensions. To losslessly compress each quantized feature, we leverage the previously compressed features from the temporal and spatial dimensions as priors and apply NVCC to generate the spatiotemporal context for contextual coding. Next, we employ a codebook to store spherical harmonics information from canonical 3DGS as quantized vectors, which are then losslessly compressed by using VQCC with the auxiliary learned hyperpriors for contextual coding, thereby reducing redundancy within the codebook. By integrating NVCC and VQCC, our contextual coding framework, 4DGS-CC, enables multi-rate 4DGS data compression tailored to specific storage requirements. Extensive experiments on three 4DGS data compression benchmarks demonstrate that our method achieves an average storage reduction of approximately 12 times while maintaining rendering fidelity compared to our baseline 4DGS approach.</p></details> |  |

SecRepoBench has 318 code generation tasks in 27 C/C++ repositories, covering 15 CWEs. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art LLMs using our benchmark and find that the models struggle with generating correct and secure code. In addition, the performance of LLMs to generate self-contained programs as measured by prior benchmarks do not translate to comparative performance at generating secure and correct code at the repository level in SecRepoBench. We show that the state-of-the-art prompt engineering techniques become less effective when applied to the repository level secure code generation problem. We conduct extensive experiments, including an agentic technique to generate secure code, to demonstrate that our benchmark is currently the most difficult secure coding benchmark, compared to previous state-of-the-art benchmarks. Finally, our comprehensive analysis provides insights into potential directions for enhancing the ability of LLMs to generate correct and secure code in real-world repositories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Iceberg Beyond the Tip: Co-Compilation of a Quantum Error Detection Code and a Quantum Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21172v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress in quantum hardware is expected to make them viable tools for the study of quantum algorithms in the near term. The timeline to useful algorithmic experimentation can be accelerated by techniques that use many noisy shots to produce an accurate estimate of the observable of interest. One such technique is to encode the quantum circuit using an error detection code and discard the samples for which an error has been detected. An underexplored property of error-detecting codes is the flexibility in the circuit encoding and fault-tolerant gadgets, which enables their co-optimization with the algorthmic circuit. However, standard circuit optimization tools cannot be used to exploit this flexibility as optimization must preserve the fault-tolerance of the gadget. In this work, we focus on the $[[k+2, k, 2]]$ Iceberg quantum error detection code, which is tailored to trapped-ion quantum processors. We design new flexible fault-tolerant gadgets for the Iceberg code, which we then co-optimize with the algorithmic circuit for the quantum approximate optimization algorithm (QAOA) using tree search. By co-optimizing the QAOA circuit and the Iceberg gadgets, we achieve an improvement in QAOA success probability from $44\%$ to $65\%$ and an increase in post-selection rate from $4\%$ to $33\%$ at 22 algorithmic qubits, utilizing 330 algorithmic two-qubit gates and 744 physical two-qubit gates on the Quantinuum H2-1 quantum computer, compared to the previous state-of-the-art hardware demonstration. Furthermore, we demonstrate better-than-unencoded performance for up to 34 algorithmic qubits, employing 510 algorithmic two-qubit gates and 1140 physical two-qubit gates.</p></details> |  |

Analyzing student debugging behavior in this process may reveal important insights into their knowledge and inform better personalized support tools. In this work, we propose an encoder-decoder-based model that learns meaningful code-edit embeddings between consecutive student code submissions, to capture their debugging behavior. Our model leverages information on whether a student code submission passes each test case to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) to learn code editing representations. It enables personalized next-step code suggestions that maintain the student's coding style while improving test case correctness. Our model also enables us to analyze student code-editing patterns to uncover common student errors and debugging behaviors, using clustering techniques. Experimental results on a real-world student code submission dataset demonstrate that our model excels at code reconstruction and personalized code suggestion while revealing interesting patterns in student debugging behavior.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on the 26th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence in Education (AIED 2025)</p></details> |

However, these models require significant computational resources for training and fine-tuning, posing challenges for real-world adoption in resource-constrained environments. To address this, the research community has increasingly turned to Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)-a class of techniques that enables the adaptation of large models by updating only a small subset of parameters, rather than the entire model. In this Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we examine the growing application of PEFT techniques-across a wide range of software engineering tasks. We analyze how these methods are used to optimize various deep learning (DL) architectures, focusing on their impact on both performance and efficiency. Our study synthesizes findings from 27 peer-reviewed papers, identifying patterns in configuration strategies and adaptation trade-offs. The outcome of this review is a comprehensive taxonomy that categorizes PEFT usage by task type, distinguishing between generative (e.g., Code Summarization) and non-generative (e.g., Code Clone Detection) scenarios. Our findings aim to inform future research and guide the practical deployment of PEFT in sustainable, AI-powered software development.

| **[LocAgent: Graph-Guided LLM Agents for Code Localization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.09089v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code localization--identifying precisely where in a codebase changes need to be made--is a fundamental yet challenging task in software maintenance. Existing approaches struggle to efficiently navigate complex codebases when identifying relevant code sections. The challenge lies in bridging natural language problem descriptions with the appropriate code elements, often requiring reasoning across hierarchical structures and multiple dependencies. We introduce LocAgent, a framework that addresses code localization through graph-based representation. By parsing codebases into directed heterogeneous graphs, LocAgent creates a lightweight representation that captures code structures (files, classes, functions) and their dependencies (imports, invocations, inheritance), enabling LLM agents to effectively search and locate relevant entities through powerful multi-hop reasoning. Experimental results on real-world benchmarks demonstrate that our approach significantly enhances accuracy in code localization. Notably, our method with the fine-tuned Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct-32B model achieves comparable results to SOTA proprietary models at greatly reduced cost (approximately 86% reduction), reaching up to 92.7% accuracy on file-level localization while improving downstream GitHub issue resolution success rates by 12% for multiple attempts (Pass@10). Our code is available at https://github.com/gersteinlab/LocAgent.</p></details> |  |

This paper not only examines the security of code generated by ChatGPT based on real developer interactions, curated in the DevGPT dataset, but also assesses ChatGPT's capability to find and fix these vulnerabilities. We analysed 1,586 C, C++, and C# code snippets using static scanners, which detected potential issues in 124 files. After manual analysis, we selected 26 files with 32 confirmed vulnerabilities for further investigation. We submitted these files to ChatGPT via the OpenAI API, asking it to detect security issues, identify the corresponding Common Weakness Enumeration numbers, and propose fixes. The responses and modified code were manually reviewed and re-scanned for vulnerabilities. ChatGPT successfully detected 18 out of 32 security issues and resolved 17 issues but failed to recognize or fix the remainder. Interestingly, only 10 vulnerabilities were resulted from the user prompts, while 22 were introduced by ChatGPT itself. We highlight for developers that code generated by ChatGPT is more likely to contain vulnerabilities compared to their own code. Furthermore, at times ChatGPT reports incorrect information with apparent confidence, which may mislead less experienced developers.

Software developers often leverage both general-purpose and code-specialized LLMs to revise existing code or even generate a whole function from scratch. These capabilities are also beneficial in no-code or low-code contexts, in which one can write programs without a technical background. However, due to their internal design, LLMs are prone to generating hallucinations, which are incorrect, nonsensical, and not justifiable information but difficult to identify its presence. This problem also occurs when generating source code. Once hallucinated code is produced, it is often challenging for users to identify and fix it, especially when such hallucinations can be identified under specific execution paths. As a result, the hallucinated code may remain unnoticed within the codebase. This survey investigates recent studies and techniques relevant to hallucinations generated by CodeLLMs. We categorize the types of hallucinations in the code generated by CodeLLMs, review existing benchmarks and mitigation strategies, and identify open challenges. Based on these findings, this survey outlines further research directions in the detection and removal of hallucinations produced by CodeLLMs.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 figures |

However, existing benchmarks are often narrow in scope, focusing on a specific task and lack a comprehensive evaluation framework that reflects real-world applications. To address these gaps, we introduce CoCo-Bench (Comprehensive Code Benchmark), designed to evaluate LLMs across four critical dimensions: code understanding, code generation, code modification, and code review. These dimensions capture essential developer needs, ensuring a more systematic and representative evaluation. CoCo-Bench includes multiple programming languages and varying task difficulties, with rigorous manual review to ensure data quality and accuracy. Empirical results show that CoCo-Bench aligns with existing benchmarks while uncovering significant variations in model performance, effectively highlighting strengths and weaknesses. By offering a holistic and objective evaluation, CoCo-Bench provides valuable insights to guide future research and technological advancements in code-oriented LLMs, establishing a reliable benchmark for the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ACL 2025.

| **[On the Optimal Source Key Size of Secure Gradient Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20662v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With gradient coding, a user node can efficiently aggregate gradients from server nodes processing local datasets, achieving low communication costs and maintaining resilience against straggling servers. This paper considers a secure gradient coding problem, where a user aims to compute the sum of the gradients from $K$ datasets with the assistance of $N$ distributed servers. The user should recover the sum of gradients by receiving transmissions from any $N_r$ servers, and each dataset is assigned to $N - N_r + m$ servers. The security constraint guarantees that even if the user receives transmissions from all servers, it cannot obtain any additional information about the datasets beyond the sum of gradients. It has been shown in the literature that this security constraint does not increase the optimal communication cost of the gradient coding problem, provided enough source keys are shared among the servers. However, the minimum required source key size that ensures security while maintaining this optimal communication cost has only been studied for the special case $m = 1$. In this paper, we focus on the more general case $m \geq 1$ and aim to determine the minimum required source key size for this purpose. We propose a new information-theoretic converse bound on the source key size, as well as a new achievable scheme with carefully designed data assignments. Our scheme outperforms the existing optimal scheme based on the widely used cyclic data assignment and coincides with the converse bound under certain system parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[ComplexVCoder: An LLM-Driven Framework for Systematic Generation of Complex Verilog Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20653v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances have demonstrated the promising capabilities of large language models (LLMs) in generating register-transfer level (RTL) code, such as Verilog. However, existing LLM-based frameworks still face significant challenges in accurately handling the complexity of real-world RTL designs, particularly those that are large-scale and involve multi-level module instantiations. To address this issue, we present ComplexVCoder, an open-source LLM-driven framework that enhances both the generation quality and efficiency of complex Verilog code. Specifically, we introduce a two-stage generation mechanism, which leverages an intermediate representation to enable a more accurate and structured transition from natural language descriptions to intricate Verilog designs. In addition, we introduce a rule-based alignment method and a domain-specific retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to further improve the correctness of the synthesized code by incorporating relevant design knowledge during generation. To evaluate our approach, we construct a comprehensive dataset comprising 55 complex Verilog designs derived from real-world implementations. We also release an open-source benchmark suite for systematically assessing the quality of auto-generated RTL code together with the ComplexVCoder framework. Experimental results show that ComplexVCoder outperforms SOTA frameworks such as CodeV and RTLCoder by 14.6% and 22.2%, respectively, in terms of function correctness on complex Verilog benchmarks. Furthermore, ComplexVcoder achieves comparable generation performances in terms of functionality correctness using a lightweight 32B model (Qwen2.5), rivaling larger-scale models such as GPT-3.5 and DeepSeek-V3.</p></details> |  |

However, despite their potential benefits, code generated by LLMs has been shown to generate insecure code in controlled environments, raising critical concerns about their reliability and security in real-world applications. This paper uses predefined security parameters to evaluate the security compliance of LLM-generated code across multiple models, such as ChatGPT, DeepSeek, Claude, Gemini and Grok. The analysis reveals critical vulnerabilities in authentication mechanisms, session management, input validation and HTTP security headers. Although some models implement security measures to a limited extent, none fully align with industry best practices, highlighting the associated risks in automated software development. Our findings underscore that human expertise is crucial to ensure secure software deployment or review of LLM-generated code. Also, there is a need for robust security assessment frameworks to enhance the reliability of LLM-generated code in real-world applications.</p></details> | 9 pages |

The vast majority of known gadget chains rely on gadgets from software dependencies. Furthermore, it has been shown that small code changes in dependencies have enabled these gadget chains. This makes gadget chain detection a purely reactive endeavor. Even if one dependency's deployment pipeline employs gadget chain detection, a gadget chain can still result from gadgets in other dependencies. In this work, we assess how likely small code changes are to enable a gadget chain. These changes could either be accidental or intentional as part of a supply chain attack. Specifically, we show that class serializability is a strongly fluctuating property over a dependency's evolution. Then, we investigate three change patterns by which an attacker could stealthily introduce gadgets into a dependency. We apply these patterns to 533 dependencies and run three state-of-the-art gadget chain detectors both on the original and the modified dependencies. The tools detect that applying the modification patterns can activate/inject gadget chains in 26.08% of the dependencies we selected. Finally, we verify the newly detected chains. As such, we identify dormant gadget chains in 53 dependencies that could be added through minor code modifications. This both shows that Java deserialization gadget chains are a broad liability to software and proves dormant gadget chains as a lucrative supply chain attack vector.</p></details> |  |

We propose Agentic Retrieval-Augmented Code Synthesis (ARCS), an advanced framework for accurate, robust, and efficient code generation, completion, and translation. ARCS integrates Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) with Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning to systematically break down and iteratively refine complex programming tasks. An agent-based RAG mechanism retrieves relevant code snippets, while real-time execution feedback drives the synthesis of candidate solutions. This process is formalized as a state-action search tree optimization, balancing code correctness with editing efficiency. Evaluations on the Geeks4Geeks and HumanEval benchmarks demonstrate that ARCS significantly outperforms traditional prompting methods in translation and generation quality. By enabling scalable and precise code synthesis, ARCS offers transformative potential for automating and optimizing code development in supercomputing applications, enhancing computational resource utilization.</p></details> |  |
| **[List Decoding Expander-Based Codes up to Capacity in Near-Linear Time](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20333v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We give a new framework based on graph regularity lemmas, for list decoding and list recovery of codes based on spectral expanders. Using existing algorithms for computing regularity decompositions of sparse graphs in (randomized) near-linear time, and appropriate choices for the constant-sized inner/base codes, we prove the following: - Expander-based codes constructed using the distance amplification technique of Alon, Edmonds and Luby [FOCS 1995] with rate $\rho$, can be list decoded to a radius $1 - \rho - \epsilon$ in near-linear time. By known results, the output list has size $O(1/\epsilon)$. - The above codes of Alon, Edmonds and Luby, with rate $\rho$, can also be list recovered to radius $1 - \rho - \epsilon$ in near-linear time, with constant-sized output lists. - The Tanner code construction of Sipser and Spielman [IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory 1996] with distance $\delta$, can be list decoded to radius $\delta - \epsilon$ in near-linear time, with constant-sized output lists. Our results imply novel combinatorial as well as algorithmic bounds for each of the above explicit constructions. All of these bounds are obtained via combinatorial rigidity phenomena, proved using (weak) graph regularity. The regularity framework allows us to lift the list decoding and list recovery properties for the local base codes, to the global codes obtained via the above constructions.</p></details> |  |
| **[RocketPPA: Ultra-Fast LLM-Based PPA Estimator at Code-Level Abstraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21971v2)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have recently transformed hardware design, yet bridging the gap between code synthesis and PPA (power, performance, and area) estimation remains a challenge. In this work, we introduce a novel framework that leverages a 21k dataset of thoroughly cleaned and synthesizable Verilog modules, each annotated with detailed power, delay, and area metrics. By employing chain-of-thought techniques, we automatically debug and curate this dataset to ensure high fidelity in downstream applications. We then fine-tune CodeLlama using LoRA-based parameter-efficient methods, framing the task as a regression problem to accurately predict PPA metrics from Verilog code. Furthermore, we augment our approach with a mixture-of-experts architecture-integrating both LoRA and an additional MLP expert layer-to further refine predictions. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements: power estimation accuracy is enhanced by 5.9% at a 20% error threshold and by 7.2% at a 10% threshold, delay estimation improves by 5.1% and 3.9%, and area estimation sees gains of 4% and 7.9% for the 20% and 10% thresholds, respectively. Notably, the incorporation of the mixture-of-experts module contributes an additional 3--4% improvement across these tasks. Our results establish a new benchmark for PPA-aware Verilog generation, highlighting the effectiveness of our integrated dataset and modeling strategies for next-generation EDA workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prompting LLMs for Code Editing: Struggles and Remedies](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20196v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming software engineering, with coding assistants embedded in an IDE becoming increasingly prevalent. While research has focused on improving the tools and understanding developer perceptions, a critical gap exists in understanding how developers actually use these tools in their daily workflows, and, crucially, where they struggle. This paper addresses part of this gap through a multi-phased investigation of developer interactions with an LLM-powered code editing and transformation feature, Transform Code, in an IDE widely used at Google. First, we analyze telemetry logs of the feature usage, revealing that frequent re-prompting can be an indicator of developer struggles with using Transform Code. Second, we conduct a qualitative analysis of unsatisfactory requests, identifying five key categories of information often missing from developer prompts. Finally, based on these findings, we propose and evaluate a tool, AutoPrompter, for automatically improving prompts by inferring missing information from the surrounding code context, leading to a 27% improvement in edit correctness on our test set.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Coded Caching with Low Subpacketization and Coding Delay using Combinatorial t-Designs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.12747v3)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coded caching scheme originally proposed by Maddah-Ali and Niesen (MN) considered a broadcast network consisting of a single server connected to a set of users each having a cache memory. Motivated by practical scenarios, Karamchandani \textit{et al.} in [16] proposed a coded caching scheme for a two-layer hierarchical network consisting of a single server connected to multiple mirror sites and each mirror site connected to a distinct set of users, in which both mirror sites and users having cache memories. Low subpacketization level coded caching schemes are desirable for practical implementations. Placement delivery array (PDA) was proposed as a tool to design coded caching schemes with reduced subpacketization level by Yan \textit{et al.} in [4]. Schemes with reduced subpacketization levels are studied extensively in the literature for single-layer networks. Kong \textit{et al.} in [17] proposed a structure called hierarchical placement delivery arrays (HPDA), which characterizes a hierarchical coded caching system and also proposed a class of HPDAs that gives low subpacketization level schemes by using two PDAs. Low subpacketization level hierarchical schemes using combinatorial $t$-designs is proposed in [20]. Apart from that there is no other existing work that discusses the subpacketization problem in a hierarchical network. This paper proposes a class of HPDA construction that gives low subpacketization level hierarchical coded caching schemes, by first constructing a new class of PDAs. Compared with the existing schemes, in cases where the system parameters and subpacketization level are the same, the proposed hierarchical scheme has a better coding delay. Further, the new class of PDAs constructed either subsumes several known PDA constructions or achieves better transmission load for the same system parameters.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Internet of Things Journal (Accepted for publication).

Today, the most promising approach is a class of error-correcting codes called surface codes. We study the problem of compiling quantum circuits for quantum computers implementing surface codes. Optimal or near-optimal compilation is critical for both efficiency and correctness. The compilation problem requires (1) mapping circuit qubits to the device qubits and (2) routing execution paths between interacting qubits. We solve this problem efficiently and near-optimally with a novel algorithm that exploits the dependency structure of circuit operations to formulate discrete optimization problems that can be approximated via simulated annealing, a classic and simple algorithm. Our extensive evaluation shows that our approach is powerful and flexible for compiling realistic workloads.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of OOPSLA 2025 paper</p></details> |

This paper presents the study on skew generalized quasi-cyclic (SGQC) codes of length $n$ over the non-chain ring $F_q+vF_q$ where $v^2=v$ and $\theta_t$ is the Galois automorphism. Here, first, we prove the dual of an SGQC code of length $n$ is also an SGQC code of the same length and derive a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of a self-dual SGQC code. Then, we discuss the $1$-generator polynomial and the $\rho$-generator polynomial for skew generalized quasi-cyclic codes. Further, we determine the dimension and BCH type bound for the 1-generator skew generalized quasi-cyclic codes. As a by-product, with the help of MAGMA software, we provide a few examples of SGQC codes and obtain some $2$-generator SGQC codes of index $2$.</p></details> | 24 |

This work proposes the focal loss as a distortion measure for lossy source coding. The paper provides single-shot converse and achievability bounds. These bounds are then used to characterize the distortion-rate trade-off in the infinite blocklength, which is shown to be the same as that for the log loss case. In the non-asymptotic case, the difference between focal loss and log loss is illustrated through a series of simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Blank Space: Adaptive Causal Coding for Streaming Communications Over Multi-Hop Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11984v2)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce Blank Space AC-RLNC (BS), a novel Adaptive and Causal Network Coding (AC-RLNC) solution designed to mitigate the triplet trade-off between throughput-delay-efficiency in multi-hop networks. BS leverages the network's physical limitations considering the bottleneck from each node to the destination. In particular, BS introduces a light-computational re-encoding algorithm, called Network AC-RLNC (NET), implemented independently at intermediate nodes. NET adaptively adjusts the Forward Error Correction (FEC) rates and schedules idle periods. It incorporates two distinct suspension mechanisms: 1) Blank Space Period, accounting for the forward-channels bottleneck, and 2) No-New No-FEC approach, based on data availability. The experimental results achieve significant improvements in resource efficiency, demonstrating a 20% reduction in channel usage compared to baseline RLNC solutions. Notably, these efficiency gains are achieved while maintaining competitive throughput and delay performance, ensuring improved resource utilization does not compromise network performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeBC: A More Secure Large Language Model for Smart Contract Code Generation in Blockchain](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21043v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language instructions, yet they often lack an understanding of security vulnerabilities. This limitation makes it difficult for LLMs to avoid security risks in generated code, particularly in high-security programming tasks such as smart contract development for blockchain. Researchers have attempted to enhance the vulnerability awareness of these models by training them to differentiate between vulnerable and fixed code snippets. However, this approach relies heavily on manually labeled vulnerability data, which is only available for popular languages like Python and C++. For low-resource languages like Solidity, used in smart contracts, large-scale annotated datasets are scarce and difficult to obtain. To address this challenge, we introduce CodeBC, a code generation model specifically designed for generating secure smart contracts in blockchain. CodeBC employs a three-stage fine-tuning approach based on CodeLlama, distinguishing itself from previous methods by not relying on pairwise vulnerability location annotations. Instead, it leverages vulnerability and security tags to teach the model the differences between vulnerable and secure code. During the inference phase, the model leverages security tags to generate secure and robust code. Experimental results demonstrate that CodeBC outperforms baseline models in terms of BLEU, CodeBLEU, and compilation pass rates, while significantly reducing vulnerability rates. These findings validate the effectiveness and cost-efficiency of our three-stage fine-tuning strategy, making CodeBC a promising solution for generating secure smart contract code.</p></details> |  |

For Type-I cycles, we propose a method to make the difference between estimated and true noise degenerate. Type-II cycles are shown to be uncorrectable, while for Type-III cycles, we utilize the fact that cycles in non-binary LDPC codes do not necessarily correspond to codewords, allowing us to estimate the true noise.

The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has introduced promising opportunities for advancing qualitative research, particularly in the automated coding of dialogue data. However, the inherent contextual complexity of dialogue presents unique challenges for these models, especially in understanding and interpreting complex contextual information. This study addresses these challenges by developing a novel LLM-assisted automated coding approach for dialogue data. The novelty of our proposed framework is threefold: 1) We predict the code for an utterance based on dialogue-specific characteristics -- communicative acts and communicative events -- using separate prompts following the role prompts and chain-of-thoughts methods; 2) We engaged multiple LLMs including GPT-4-turbo, GPT-4o, DeepSeek in collaborative code prediction; 3) We leveraged the interrelation between events and acts to implement consistency checking using GPT-4o. In particular, our contextual consistency checking provided a substantial accuracy improvement. We also found the accuracy of act predictions was consistently higher than that of event predictions. This study contributes a new methodological framework for enhancing the precision of automated coding of dialogue data as well as offers a scalable solution for addressing the contextual challenges inherent in dialogue analysis.</p></details> |  |

Although existing identifier substitution attackers demonstrate high success rates, they often produce adversarial examples with unnatural code patterns. In this paper, we systematically assess the quality of adversarial examples using LLM-as-a-Judge. Our analysis reveals that over 80% of adversarial examples generated by state-of-the-art identifier substitution attackers (e.g., ALERT) are actually detectable. Based on this insight, we propose EP-Shield, a unified framework for evaluating and purifying identifier substitution attacks via naturalness-aware reasoning. Specifically, we first evaluate the naturalness of code and identify the perturbed adversarial code, then purify it so that the victim model can restore correct prediction. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of EP-Shield over adversarial fine-tuning (up to 83.36% improvement) and its lightweight design 7B parameters) with GPT-4-level performance.</p></details> | 25 pages, 6 figures |

Then we derive converse results by characterizing new properties of secure coded caching schemes. As a result, we characterize the two end-points of the optimal memory-rate tradeoff curve for arbitrary number of users and files. Furthermore, for the case of $N=2$ files and arbitrary number of users, we also characterize a segment of the optimal memory-rate tradeoff curve, where the cache size is relatively small.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |

However, translating these multimodal elements into executable code remains a challenging and time-consuming process that requires substantial ML expertise. We introduce ``Paper-to-Code'' (P2C), a novel task that transforms the multimodal content of scientific publications into fully executable code repositories, which extends beyond the existing formulation of code generation that merely converts textual descriptions into isolated code snippets. To automate the P2C process, we propose AutoP2C, a multi-agent framework based on large language models that processes both textual and visual content from research papers to generate complete code repositories. Specifically, AutoP2C contains four stages: (1) repository blueprint extraction from established codebases, (2) multimodal content parsing that integrates information from text, equations, and figures, (3) hierarchical task decomposition for structured code generation, and (4) iterative feedback-driven debugging to ensure functionality and performance. Evaluation on a benchmark of eight research papers demonstrates the effectiveness of AutoP2C, which can successfully generate executable code repositories for all eight papers, while OpenAI-o1 or DeepSeek-R1 can only produce runnable code for one paper. The code is available at https://github.com/shoushouyu/Automated-Paper-to-Code.</p></details> |  |

Exploring the Influence of Method Dependencies on Code Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19459v1)** | 2025-04-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Method-level comments are critical for improving code comprehension and supporting software maintenance. With advancements in large language models (LLMs), automated comment generation has become a major research focus. However, existing approaches often overlook method dependencies, where one method relies on or calls others, affecting comment quality and code understandability. This study investigates the prevalence and impact of dependent methods in software projects and introduces a dependency-aware approach for method-level comment generation. Analyzing a dataset of 10 popular Java GitHub projects, we found that dependent methods account for 69.25% of all methods and exhibit higher engagement and change proneness compared to independent methods. Across 448K dependent and 199K independent methods, we observed that state-of-the-art fine-tuned models (e.g., CodeT5+, CodeBERT) struggle to generate comprehensive comments for dependent methods, a trend also reflected in LLM-based approaches like ASAP. To address this, we propose HelpCOM, a novel dependency-aware technique that incorporates helper method information to improve comment clarity, comprehensiveness, and relevance. Experiments show that HelpCOM outperforms baseline methods by 5.6% to 50.4% across syntactic (e.g., BLEU), semantic (e.g., SentenceBERT), and LLM-based evaluation metrics. A survey of 156 software practitioners further confirms that HelpCOM significantly improves the comprehensibility of code involving dependent methods, highlighting its potential to enhance documentation, maintainability, and developer productivity in large-scale systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Just ...</summary><p>Just Accepted at EASE 2025</p></details> |

This condition imposes a less stringent distance requirement than classical error-correcting codes (ECCs), allowing for reduced redundancy. FCCs were introduced by Lenz et al. (2021), who also established a lower bound on the optimal redundancy for FCCs over the binary field. Here, we derive an upper bound within a logarithmic factor of this lower bound. We show that the same lower bound holds for any finite field. Moreover, we show that this bound is tight for sufficiently large fields by demonstrating that it also serves as an upper bound. Furthermore, we construct an encoding scheme that achieves this optimal redundancy. Finally, motivated by these two extreme regimes, we conjecture that our bound serves as a valid upper bound across all finite fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>v2: R...</summary><p>v2: Remove 1 redundant page at the end.

However, these comments often become outdated as software evolves, degrading model performance. Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating high-quality code comments. We investigate whether replacing human-written comments with LLM-generated ones improves pre-training datasets. Since standard metrics cannot assess reference comment quality, we propose two novel reference-free evaluation tasks: code-comment inconsistency detection and semantic code search. Results show that LLM-generated comments are more semantically consistent with code than human-written ones, as confirmed by manual evaluation. Leveraging this finding, we rebuild the CodeSearchNet dataset with LLM-generated comments and re-pre-train CodeT5. Evaluations demonstrate that models trained on LLM-enhanced data outperform those using original human comments in code summarization, generation, and translation tasks. This work validates rebuilding pre-training datasets with LLMs to advance code intelligence, challenging the traditional reliance on human reference comments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Award...</summary><p>Awarded the ACM SIGSOFT Distinguished Paper Award in ICPC 2025</p></details> |

Redefining linear codes as projective systems provides a geometric vantage point. In this paper, we embrace this perspective, deriving bounds on the lengths of A$^s$MDS codes (codes with Singleton defect $s$). To help frame our discussions, we introduce the parameters $m^{s}(k,q)$, denoting the maximum length of an (non-degenerate) $[n,k,d]_q$ A$^s$MDS code, $m^{s}_t(k,q)$ denoting the maximum length of an (non-degenerate) $[n,k,d]_q$ A$^s$MDS code such that the dual code is an A$^t$MDS code, and $\kappa(s,q)$, representing the maximum dimension $k$ for which there exists a linear code of (maximal) length $n=(s+1)(q+1)+k-2$. In particular, we address a gap in the literature by providing sufficient conditions on $n$ and $k$ under which the dual of an $[n,k,d]_q$ A$^s$MDS code is also an A$^s$MDS code. Our results subsume or improve several results in the literature. Some conjectures arise from our findings.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, focusing on a common synthesis machine, which generates multiple DNA strands in parallel following a fixed supersequence,we propose constrained codes with polynomial-time encoding and decoding algorithms. Compared to the existing works, our codes simultaneously satisfy both l-runlength limited and {\epsilon}-balanced constraints. By enumerating all valid sequences, our codes achieve the maximum rate, matching the capacity. Additionally, we design constrained error-correcting codes capable of correcting one insertion or deletion in the obtained DNA sequence while still adhering to the constraints.</p></details> |  |

Both tasks are solved by a two-step hierarchical algorithm. The first step differs for the two tasks generating either a piecewise-affine or a Dubins reference path. The second step leverages a transformation of vehicle dynamics from the time domain into the spatial domain and linear programming. Benefits such as a hyperparameter-free objective function and spatial constraints useful for area coverage gaps avoidance and precision path planning are discussed. The method, which is a deterministic optimisation-based method, is evaluated on 5 real-world fields solving 19 instances of the first task and 84 instances of the second task.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Users can adjust these PID parameters during flight. However, flight control programs lack sufficient safety checks on user-provided PID parameters, leading to a severe UAV vulnerability - the input validation bug. This occurs when a user misconfigures PID parameters, causing dangerous states like deviation from the expected path, loss of control, or crash. Prior works use random testing like fuzzing, but these are not effective in the three-dimensional search space of PID parameters. The expensive dynamic execution of UAV tests further hinders random testing performance. We address PID parameter misconfiguration by combining the Routh-Hurwitz stability criterion with coordinate search, introducing RouthSearch. Instead of ad-hoc identification, RouthSearch principledly determines valid ranges for three-dimensional PID parameters. We first leverage the Routh-Hurwitz Criterion to identify a theoretical PID parameter boundary, then refine it using efficient coordinate search. The determined valid range can filter misconfigured PID parameters from users during flight and help discover logical bugs in flight control programs. We evaluated RouthSearch across eight flight modes in PX4 and Ardupilot. Results show RouthSearch determines valid ranges with 92.0% accuracy compared to ground truth. RouthSearch discovers 3,853 PID misconfigurations within 48 hours, while the STOA work PGFuzz discovers only 449 sets, significantly outperforming prior works by 8.58 times. Our method also helped detect three bugs in ArduPilot and PX4.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 34rd ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Conformal Predictive Programming for Chance Constrained Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.07407v2)** | 2025-05-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose conformal predictive programming (CPP), a framework to solve chance constrained optimization problems, i.e., optimization problems with constraints that are functions of random variables. CPP utilizes samples from these random variables along with the quantile lemma - central to conformal prediction - to transform the chance constrained optimization problem into a deterministic problem with a quantile reformulation. CPP inherits a priori guarantees on constraint satisfaction from existing sample average approximation approaches for a class of chance constrained optimization problems, and it provides a posteriori guarantees that are of conditional and marginal nature otherwise. The strength of CPP is that it can easily support different variants of conformal prediction which have been (or will be) proposed within the conformal prediction community. To illustrate this, we present robust CPP to deal with distribution shifts in the random variables and Mondrian CPP to deal with class conditional chance constraints. To enable tractable solutions to the quantile reformulation, we present a mixed integer programming method (CPP-MIP) encoding, a bilevel optimization strategy (CPP-Bilevel), and a sampling-and-discarding optimization strategy (CPP-Discarding). We also extend CPP to deal with joint chance constrained optimization (JCCO). In a series of case studies, we show the validity of the aforementioned approaches, empirically compare CPP-MIP, CPP-Bilevel, as well as CPP-Discarding, and illustrate the advantage of CPP as compared to scenario approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Guided Probabilistic Program Induction for POMDP Model Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02216v1)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes (POMDPs) model decision making under uncertainty. While there are many approaches to approximately solving POMDPs, we aim to address the problem of learning such models. In particular, we are interested in a subclass of POMDPs wherein the components of the model, including the observation function, reward function, transition function, and initial state distribution function, can be modeled as low-complexity probabilistic graphical models in the form of a short probabilistic program. Our strategy to learn these programs uses an LLM as a prior, generating candidate probabilistic programs that are then tested against the empirical distribution and adjusted through feedback. We experiment on a number of classical toy POMDP problems, simulated MiniGrid domains, and two real mobile-base robotics search domains involving partial observability. Our results show that using an LLM to guide in the construction of a low-complexity POMDP model can be more effective than tabular POMDP learning, behavior cloning, or direct LLM planning.</p></details> |  |

Constrained by a fixed budget, decision-makers draft a squad whose players are expected to perform well in the upcoming weeks to maximize total points. This paper proposes novel deterministic and robust integer programming models that select the optimal starting eleven and the captain. A new hybrid scoring metric is constructed using an interpretable artificial intelligence framework and underlying match performance data. Several objective functions and estimation techniques are introduced for the programming model. To the best of my knowledge, this is the first study to approach fantasy football through this lens. The models' performance is evaluated using data from the 2023/24 Premier League season. Results indicate that the proposed hybrid method achieved the highest score while maintaining consistent performance. Utilizing the Monte Carlo simulation, the strategic choice of averaging techniques for estimating cost vectors, and the proposed hybrid approach are shown to be effective during the out-of-sample period. This paper also provides a thorough analysis of the optimal formations and players selected by the models, offering valuable insights into effective fantasy football strategies.</p></details> |  |

An attractive solution to relieve the programming burden is to transcompile the legacy code of one platform to others. However, current transcompilation techniques struggle with either tremendous manual efforts or functional incorrectness, rendering "Write Once, Run Anywhere" of tensor programs an open question. We propose a novel transcompiler, i.e., QiMeng-Xpiler, for automatically translating tensor programs across DLS via both large language models (LLMs) and symbolic program synthesis, i.e., neural-symbolic synthesis. The key insight is leveraging the powerful code generation ability of LLM to make costly search-based symbolic synthesis computationally tractable. Concretely, we propose multiple LLM-assisted compilation passes via pre-defined meta-prompts for program transformation. During each program transformation, efficient symbolic program synthesis is employed to repair incorrect code snippets with a limited scale. To attain high performance, we propose a hierarchical auto-tuning approach to systematically explore both the parameters and sequences of transformation passes. Experiments on 4 DLS with distinct programming interfaces, i.e., Intel DL Boost with VNNI, NVIDIA GPU with CUDA, AMD MI with HIP, and Cambricon MLU with BANG, demonstrate that QiMeng-Xpiler correctly translates different tensor programs at the accuracy of 95% on average, and the performance of translated programs achieves up to 2.0x over vendor-provided manually-optimized libraries. As a result, the programming productivity of DLS is improved by up to 96.0x via transcompiling legacy tensor programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to OSDI 2025</p></details> |
| **[Prompt-Based Cost-Effective Evaluation and Operation of ChatGPT as a Computer Programming Teaching Assistant](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17176v3)** | 2025-05-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The dream of achieving a student-teacher ratio of 1:1 is closer than ever thanks to the emergence of large language models (LLMs). One potential application of these models in the educational field would be to provide feedback to students in university introductory programming courses, so that a student struggling to solve a basic implementation problem could seek help from an LLM available 24/7. This article focuses on studying three aspects related to such an application. First, the performance of two well-known models, GPT-3.5T and GPT-4T, in providing feedback to students is evaluated. The empirical results showed that GPT-4T performs much better than GPT-3.5T, however, it is not yet ready for use in a real-world scenario. This is due to the possibility of generating incorrect information that potential users may not always be able to detect. Second, the article proposes a carefully designed prompt using in-context learning techniques that allows automating important parts of the evaluation process, as well as providing a lower bound for the fraction of feedbacks containing incorrect information, saving time and effort. This was possible because the resulting feedback has a programmatically analyzable structure that incorporates diagnostic information about the LLM's performance in solving the requested task. Third, the article also suggests a possible strategy for implementing a practical learning tool based on LLMs, which is rooted on the proposed prompting techniques. This strategy opens up a whole range of interesting possibilities from a pedagogical perspective.</p></details> |  |

Triton-distributed is the first compiler that supports native overlapping optimizations for distributed AI workloads, providing a good coverage of existing optimizations from different frameworks. First, we integrate communication primitives compliant with the OpenSHMEM standard into the compiler. This enables programmers to utilize these primitives with a higher-level Python programming model. Second, we illustrate how to achieve complex joint optimization of computation, memory access, and communication with the assistance of the compiler. In particular, we show how to use overlapping techniques to hide latency and present our compiler-based programming methods in both single-node and multi-node scenarios. Finally, we showcase the performance of the code generated by our compiler. In a test environment with up to 64 devices, our compiler can fully utilize heterogeneous communication and computation resources to provide effective overlapping and high performance. In many cases, the performance of the generated code can even outperform hand-optimized code. Moreover, the development difficulty and the time cost for development using our compiler are far less than those of low-level programming such as CUDA/C++, which clearly demonstrates significant productivity advantages.</p></details> |  |

A Critical Examination of Floyd's Appropriation of Kuhn's Philosophy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01901v1)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper examines the philosophical relationship between Thomas Kuhn's concept of scientific paradigms and the programming paradigm concept in computing that was introduced by Floyd in his 1978 Turing Award lecture. Through critical analysis of both Kuhn's original framework and its application in computing, we argue that the contemporary usage of `programming paradigms' represents a significant departure from Kuhn's philosophical concept. We demonstrate that while Floyd explicitly attributed this term to Kuhn's work, his usage fundamentally altered the concept's meaning. We argue that this divergence necessitates a critical reassessment of the term's usage in computing discourse.</p></details> |  |
| **[Program Synthesis From Partial Traces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14480v2)** | 2025-05-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first technique to synthesize programs that compose side-effecting functions, pure functions, and control flow, from partial traces containing records of only the side-effecting functions. This technique can be applied to synthesize API composing scripts from logs of calls made to those APIs, or a script from traces of system calls made by a workload, for example. All of the provided traces are positive examples, meaning that they describe desired behavior. Our approach does not require negative examples. Instead, it generalizes over the examples and uses cost metrics to prevent over-generalization. Because the problem is too complex for traditional monolithic program synthesis techniques, we propose a new combination of optimizing rewrites and syntax-guided program synthesis. The resulting program is correct by construction, so its output will always be able to reproduce the input traces. We evaluate the quality of the programs synthesized when considering various optimization metrics and the synthesizer's efficiency on real-world benchmarks. The results show that our approach can generate useful real-world programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at PLDI 2025 (46th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation)</p></details> |

The product of these decisions forms a search space of programs which is typically intractably large. Existing approaches (e.g., auto-schedulers) often address this problem by sampling this space heuristically. In contrast, we introduce a dynamic-programming-based approach to explore more of the search space by iteratively decomposing large program specifications into smaller specifications reachable from a set of rewrites, then composing a final program from each rewrite that minimizes an affine cost model. To reduce memory requirements, we employ a novel memoization table representation, which indexes specifications by coordinates in $Z_{\geq 0}$ and compresses identical, adjacent solutions. This approach can visit a much larger set of programs than prior work. To evaluate the approach, we developed Morello, a compiler which lowers specifications roughly equivalent to a few-node XLA computation graph to x86. Notably, we found that an affine cost model is sufficient to surface high-throughput programs. For example, Morello synthesized a collection of matrix multiplication benchmarks targeting a Zen 1 CPU, including a 1x2048x16384, bfloat16-to-float32 vector-matrix multiply, which was integrated into Google's gemma.cpp.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |

These problems typically require domain knowledge, mathematical skills, and programming ability, presenting significant challenges for non-experts. This study explores the efficiency of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generating solver-specific LP code. We propose CHORUS, a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) framework for synthesizing Gurobi-based LP code from natural language problem statements. CHORUS incorporates a hierarchical tree-like chunking strategy for theoretical contents and generates additional metadata based on code examples from documentation to facilitate self-contained, semantically coherent retrieval. Two-stage retrieval approach of CHORUS followed by cross-encoder reranking further ensures contextual relevance. Finally, expertly crafted prompt and structured parser with reasoning steps improve code generation performance significantly. Experiments on the NL4Opt-Code benchmark show that CHORUS improves the performance of open-source LLMs such as Llama3.1 (8B), Llama3.3 (70B), Phi4 (14B), Deepseek-r1 (32B), and Qwen2.5-coder (32B) by a significant margin compared to baseline and conventional RAG. It also allows these open-source LLMs to outperform or match the performance of much stronger baselines-GPT3.5 and GPT4 while requiring far fewer computational resources. Ablation studies further demonstrate the importance of expert prompting, hierarchical chunking, and structured reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for presentation at the 19th Learning and Intelligent Optimization Conference (LION 19)</p></details> |

Enhancing truck platoon formation in such a heterogeneous environment presents new challenges. This paper investigates the hub-based platoon coordination problem in a mixed truck fleet, where the focus is to optimize the trucks' waiting times, charging amounts for electric trucks, and platoon leader assignments. The objective is to maximize the overall platoon revenue of the fleet while accounting for the associated waiting and charging costs. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program and present a dynamic programming approach to compute its sub-optimal solution efficiently. The proposed method operates in polynomial time, ensuring scalable computational efficiency. Simulation studies involving 1,000 trucks traveling between two hubs in Sweden demonstrate the effectiveness and scalability of the proposed approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Affine Loops: A Geometric Approach to Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00620v1)** | 2025-05-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring software correctness remains a fundamental challenge in formal program verification. One promising approach relies on finding polynomial invariants for loops. Polynomial invariants are properties of a program loop that hold before and after each iteration. Generating polynomial invariants is a crucial task for loops, but it is an undecidable problem in the general case. Recently, an alternative approach to this problem has emerged, focusing on synthesizing loops from invariants. However, existing methods only synthesize affine loops without guard conditions from polynomial invariants. In this paper, we address a more general problem, allowing loops to have polynomial update maps with a given structure, inequations in the guard condition, and polynomial invariants of arbitrary form. In this paper, we use algebraic geometry tools to design and implement an algorithm that computes a finite set of polynomial equations whose solutions correspond to all loops satisfying the given polynomial invariants. In other words, we reduce the problem of synthesizing loops to finding solutions of polynomial systems within a specified subset of the complex numbers. The latter is handled in our software using an SMT solver.</p></details> |  |

Within the context of physics-inspired machine learning applied to chemistry, we demonstrate the relevance of an ILP formulation to select molecular training sets for predictions of size-extensive properties. We show that our algorithm outperforms existing unsupervised training set selection approaches, especially when predicting properties of molecules larger than those present in the training set. We argue that the reason for the improved performance is due to the selection that is based on the notion of local similarity (i.e., per-atom) and a unique ILP approach that finds optimal solutions efficiently. Altogether, this work provides a practical algorithm to improve the performance of physics-inspired machine learning models and offers insights into the conceptual differences with existing training set selection approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages + SI (15 pages)</p></details> |

Using two established models of reflection - Boud et al.'s Model of Reflective Process and Bain et al.'s 5R Framework for Reflection - we analyse a series of reflective assignments submitted by students over four years. Our longitudinal analysis reveals clear trends in how students' reflective abilities evolve over the course of the program. We find that more sophisticated forms of reflection, such as integration of knowledge, appropriation of skills, and reconstruction of practice, increase markedly in prevalence in later years. The complementary nature of workplace experience and university study is highlighted in students' reflections, demonstrating a key benefit of the work-based learning approach. By the final year, all students demonstrate the ability to reconstruct their experiences to inform future practice. Our findings provide insight into how reflective practice develops in Software Engineering education and suggest potential value in incorporating more structured reflection into traditional degree programs. The study also reveals instances of meta-reflection, where students reflect on the value of reflection itself, indicating a deep engagement with the reflective process. While acknowledging limitations, this work offers a unique longitudinal perspective on the development of reflective practice in work-based Software Engineering education.</p></details> |  |

Problems that PDCS currently supports include linear programs, second-order cone programs, convex quadratic programs, and exponential cone programs. PDCS achieves scalability to large-scale problems by leveraging sparse matrix-vector multiplication as its core computational operation, which is both memory-efficient and well-suited for GPU acceleration. The solver is based on the restarted primal-dual hybrid gradient method but further incorporates several enhancements, including adaptive reflected Halpern restarts, adaptive step-size selection, adaptive weight adjustment, and diagonal rescaling. Additionally, PDCS employs a bijection-based method to compute projections onto rescaled cones. Furthermore, cuPDCS is a GPU implementation of PDCS and it implements customized computational schemes that utilize different levels of GPU architecture to handle cones of different types and sizes. Numerical experiments demonstrate that cuPDCS is generally more efficient than state-of-the-art commercial solvers and other first-order methods on large-scale conic program applications, including Fisher market equilibrium problems, Lasso regression, and multi-period portfolio optimization. Furthermore, cuPDCS also exhibits better scalability, efficiency, and robustness compared to other first-order methods on the conic program benchmark dataset CBLIB. These advantages are more pronounced in large-scale, lower-accuracy settings.</p></details> | 42 pages, 6 figures |

Recent DL quantization techniques demand a new matrix multiplication operator with mixed input data types, further complicating GPU optimization. Prior high-level compilers like Triton lack the expressiveness to implement key optimizations like fine-grained data pipelines and hardware-friendly memory layouts for these operators, while low-level programming models, such as Hidet, Graphene, and CUTLASS, require significant programming efforts. To balance expressiveness with engineering effort, we propose Hexcute, a tile-based programming language that exposes shared memory and register abstractions to enable fine-grained optimization for these operators. Additionally, Hexcute leverages task mapping to schedule the GPU program, and to reduce programming efforts, it automates layout and task mapping synthesis with a novel type-inference-based algorithm. Our evaluation shows that Hexcute generalizes to a wide range of DL operators, achieves 1.7-11.28$\times$ speedup over existing DL compilers for mixed-type operators, and brings up to 2.91$\times$ speedup in the end-to-end evaluation.</p></details> | 17 pages, 24 figures |
| **[InvAASTCluster: On Applying Invariant-Based Program Clustering to Introductory Programming Assignments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2206.14175v3)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the vast number of students enrolled in programming courses, there has been an increasing number of automated program repair techniques focused on introductory programming assignments (IPAs). Typically, such techniques use program clustering to take advantage of previous correct student implementations to repair a new incorrect submission. These repair techniques use clustering methods since analyzing all available correct submissions to repair a program is not feasible. However, conventional clustering methods rely on program representations based on features such as abstract syntax trees (ASTs), syntax, control flow, and data flow. This paper proposes InvAASTCluster, a novel approach for program clustering that uses dynamically generated program invariants to cluster semantically equivalent IPAs. InvAASTCluster's program representation uses a combination of the program's semantics, through its invariants, and its structure through its anonymized abstract syntax tree (AASTs). Invariants denote conditions that must remain true during program execution, while AASTs are ASTs devoid of variable and function names, retaining only their types. Our experiments show that the proposed program representation outperforms syntax-based representations when clustering a set of correct IPAs.

| **[Testing CPS with Design Assumptions-Based Metamorphic Relations and Genetic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03330v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs) software is used to enforce desired behaviours on physical systems. To test the interaction between the CPS software and the system's physics, engineers provide traces of desired physical states and observe traces of the actual physical states. CPS requirements describe how closely the actual physical traces should track the desired traces. These requirements are typically defined for specific, simple input traces such as step or ramp sequences, and thus are not applicable to arbitrary inputs. This limits the availability of oracles for CPSs. Our recent work proposes an approach to testing CPS using control-theoretical design assumptions instead of requirements. This approach circumvents the oracle problem by leveraging the control-theoretical guarantees that are provided when the design assumptions are satisfied. To address the test case generation and oracle problems, researchers have proposed metamorphic testing, which is based on the study of relations across tests, i.e., metamorphic relations (MRs). In this work, we define MRs based on the design assumptions and explore combinations of these MRs using genetic programming to generate CPS test cases. This enables the generation of CPS input traces with potentially arbitrary shapes, together with associated expected output traces. We use the deviation from the expected output traces to guide the generation of input traces that falsify the MRs. Our experiment results show that the MR-falsification provides engineers with new information, helping them identify passed and failed test cases. Furthermore, we show that the generation of traces that falsify the MRs is a non-trivial problem, which is successfully addressed by our genetic search.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-time Program Evaluation using Anytime-valid Rank Tests](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21595v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counterfactual mean estimators such as difference-in-differences and synthetic control have grown into workhorse tools for program evaluation. Inference for these estimators is well-developed in settings where all post-treatment data is available at the time of analysis. However, in settings where data arrives sequentially, these tests do not permit real-time inference, as they require a pre-specified sample size T. We introduce real-time inference for program evaluation through anytime-valid rank tests. Our methodology relies on interpreting the absence of a treatment effect as exchangeability of the treatment estimates. We then convert these treatment estimates into sequential ranks, and construct optimal finite-sample valid sequential tests for exchangeability. We illustrate our methods in the context of difference-in-differences and synthetic control. In simulations, they control size even under mild exchangeability violations. While our methods suffer slight power loss at T, they allow for early rejection (before T) and preserve the ability to reject later (after T).</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Read Promotion and Mixed Isolation Levels for Performant Yet Serializable Execution of Transaction Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18377v2)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a theory that can determine the lowest isolation level that can be allocated to each transaction program in an application in a mixed-isolation-level setting, to guarantee that all executions will be serializable and thus preserve all integrity constraints, even those that are not explicitly declared. This extends prior work applied to completely known transactions, to deal with the realistic situation where transactions are generated by running programs with parameters that are not known in advance. Using our theory, we propose an optimization method that allows for high throughput while ensuring that all executions are serializable. Our method is based on searching for application code modifications that are semantics-preserving while improving the isolation level allocation. We illustrate our approach to the SmallBank benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Intermediate Program Representation for Optimizing Stream-Based Languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21458v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Stream-based runtime monitors are safety assurance tools that check at runtime whether the system's behavior satisfies a formal specification. Specifications consist of stream equations, which relate input streams, containing sensor readings and other incoming information, to output streams, representing filtered and aggregated data. This paper presents a framework for the stream-based specification language RTLola. We introduce a new intermediate representation for stream-based languages, the StreamIR, which, like the specification language, operates on streams of unbounded length; while the stream equations are replaced by imperative programs. We developed a set of optimizations based on static analysis of the specification and have implemented an interpreter and a compiler for several target languages. In our evaluation, we measure the performance of several real-world case studies. The results show that using the StreamIR framework reduces the runtime significantly compared to the existing StreamIR interpreter. We evaluate the effect of the optimizations and show that significant performance gains are possible beyond the optimizations of the target language's compiler. While our current implementation is limited to RTLola, the StreamIR is designed to accommodate other stream-based languages, enabling their interpretation and compilation into all available target languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Quantum-Safe Homomorphic Encryption for Quantum Computer Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21235v1)** | 2025-04-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a lattice-based scheme for homomorphic evaluation of quantum programs and proofs that remains secure against quantum adversaries. Classical homomorphic encryption is lifted to the quantum setting by replacing composite-order groups with Module Learning-With-Errors (MLWE) lattices and by generalizing polynomial functors to bounded natural super functors (BNSFs). A secret depolarizing BNSF mask hides amplitudes, while each quantum state is stored as an MLWE ciphertext pair. We formalize security with the qIND-CPA game that allows coherent access to the encryption oracle and give a four-hybrid reduction to decisional MLWE. The design also covers practical issues usually left open. A typed QC-bridge keeps classical bits produced by measurements encrypted yet still usable as controls, with weak-measurement semantics for expectation-value workloads. Encrypted Pauli twirls add circuit privacy. If a fixed knowledge base is needed, its axioms are shipped as MLWE "capsules"; the evaluator can use them but cannot read them. A rho-calculus driver schedules encrypted tasks across several QPUs and records an auditable trace on an RChain-style ledger. Performance analysis shows that the extra lattice arithmetic fits inside today's QPU idle windows: a 100-qubit, depth-10^3 teleportation-based proof runs in about 10 ms, the public key (seed only) is 32 bytes, and even a CCA-level key stays below 300 kB. A photonic Dirac-3 prototype that executes homomorphic teleportation plus knowledge-base-relative amplitude checks appears feasible with current hardware. These results indicate that fully homomorphic, knowledge-base-aware quantum reasoning is compatible with near-term quantum clouds and standard post-quantum security assumptions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mìmir: A real-time interactive visualization library for CUDA programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20937v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-time visualization of computational simulations running over graphics processing units (GPU) is a valuable feature in modern science and technological research, as it allows researchers to visually assess the quality and correctness of their computational models during the simulation. Due to the high throughput involved in GPU-based simulations, classical visualization approaches such as ones based on copying to RAM or storage are not feasible anymore, as they imply large memory transfers between GPU and CPU at each moment, reducing both computational performance and interactivity. Implementing real-time visualizers for GPU simulation codes is a challenging task as it involves dealing with i) low-level integration of graphics APIs (e.g, OpenGL and Vulkan) into the general-purpose GPU code, ii) a careful and efficient handling of memory spaces and iii) finding a balance between rendering and computing as both need the GPU resources. In this work we present M\`imir, a CUDA/Vulkan interoperability C++ library that allows users to add real-time 2D/3D visualization to CUDA codes with low programming effort. With M\`imir, researchers can leverage state-of-the-art CUDA/Vulkan interoperability features without needing to invest time in learning the complex low-level technical aspects involved. Internally, M\`imir streamlines the interoperability mapping between CUDA device memory containing simulation data and Vulkan graphics resources, so that changes on the data are instantly reflected in the visualization. This abstraction scheme allows generating visualizations with minimal alteration over the original source code, needing only to replace the GPU memory allocation lines of the data to be visualized by the API calls provided by M\`imir among other optional changes.</p></details> |  |

This principle of cognitive mapping is universal to agents with limited resources. Living organisms, people, and algorithms all face the problem of forming functional representations of their world under various computing constraints. In this work, we explore the hypothesis that human resource-efficient planning may arise from representing the world as predictably structured. Building on the metaphor of concepts as programs, we propose that cognitive maps can take the form of generative programs that exploit predictability and redundancy, in contrast to directly encoding spatial layouts. We use a behavioral experiment to show that people who navigate in structured spaces rely on modular planning strategies that align with programmatic map representations. We describe a computational model that predicts human behavior in a variety of structured scenarios. This model infers a small distribution over possible programmatic cognitive maps conditioned on human prior knowledge of the world, and uses this distribution to generate resource-efficient plans. Our models leverages a Large Language Model as an embedding of human priors, implicitly learned through training on a vast corpus of human data. Our model demonstrates improved computational efficiency, requires drastically less memory, and outperforms unstructured planning algorithms with cognitive constraints at predicting human behavior, suggesting that human planning strategies rely on programmatic cognitive maps.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, to be published in Cognitive Sciences Society proceedings</p></details> |
| **[DeeP-Mod: Deep Dynamic Programming based Environment Modelling using Feature Extraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20535v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The DeeP-Mod framework builds an environment model using features from a Deep Dynamic Programming Network (DDPN), trained via a Deep Q-Network (DQN). While Deep Q-Learning is effective in decision-making, state information is lost in deeper DQN layers due to mixed state-action representations. We address this by using Dynamic Programming (DP) to train a DDPN, where Value Iteration ensures the output represents state values, not state-action pairs. Extracting features from the DDPN preserves state information, enabling task and action set independence. We show that a reduced DDPN can be trained using features extracted from the original DDPN trained on an identical problem. This reduced DDPN achieves faster convergence under noise and outperforms the original DDPN. Finally, we introduce the DeeP-Mod framework, which creates an environment model using the evolution of features extracted from a DDPN in response to actions. A second DDPN, which learns directly from this feature model rather than raw states, can learn an effective feature-value representation and thus optimal policy. A key advantage of DeeP-Mod is that an externally defined environment model is not needed at any stage, making DDPN applicable to a wide range of environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hetu v2: A General and Scalable Deep Learning System with Hierarchical and Heterogeneous Single Program Multiple Data Annotations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20490v1)** | 2025-04-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD) paradigm provides a unified abstraction to annotate various parallel dimensions in distributed deep learning (DL) training. With SPMD, users can write training programs from the viewpoint of a single device, and the system will automatically deduce the tensor sharding and communication patterns. However, with the recent development in large-scale DL models, distributed training exhibits spatial and temporal workload heterogeneity, arising from both device disparities (e.g., mixed hardware, failures) and data variations (e.g., uneven sequence lengths). Such heterogeneity violates SPMD's assumption of uniform workload partitioning, which restricts its ability to express and optimize heterogeneous parallel strategies effectively. To address this, we propose HSPMD within the Hetu v2 system to achieve general and scalable DL training. HSPMD extends SPMD's annotations to support asymmetric sharding and composes standard communication primitives for hierarchical communication, all while retaining the simplicity of a single-device declarative programming model. Leveraging HSPMD, Hetu handles spatial heterogeneity through progressive graph specialization, enabling device-specific execution logic, and addresses temporal heterogeneity via dynamic graph switching. Evaluations on heterogeneous clusters, elastic training, and mixed-length data scenarios show that HSPMD matches or outperforms specialized systems, providing a flexible and efficient solution for modern large-scale model training.</p></details> |  |

For this purpose, modern programming languages provide strongly-consistent shared objects. To account for their many usages, these objects offer a large API. However, in practice, each program calls only a tiny fraction of the interface. Leveraging such an observation, we propose to tailor a shared object for a specific usage. We call this principle adjusted objects. Adjusted objects already exist in the wild. This paper provides their first systematic study. We explain how everyday programmers already adjust common shared objects (such as queues, maps, and counters) for better performance. We present the formal foundations of adjusted objects using a new tool to characterize scalability, the indistinguishability graph. Leveraging this study, we introduce a library named DEGO to inject adjusted objects in a Java program. In micro-benchmarks, objects from the DEGO library improve the performance of standard JDK shared objects by up to two orders of magnitude. We also evaluate DEGO with a Retwis-like benchmark modeled after a social network application. On a modern server-class machine, DEGO boosts by up to 1.7x the performance of the benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A shorter version of this work has appeared in the proceedings of the 26th ACM/IFIP International Middleware Conference (Middleware '25)</p></details> |

However, the systematic synthesis of DTCBFs in a computationally efficient way is at present an important open problem. This article first proposes a novel alternating-descent approach based on Sum-of-Squares programming to synthesize quadratic DTCBFs and corresponding polynomial control policies for discrete-time control-affine polynomial systems with input constraints and semi-algebraic safe sets. Subsequently, two distinct approaches are introduced to extend the proposed method to the synthesis of higher-degree polynomial DTCBFs. To demonstrate its efficacy, we apply the proposed method to numerical case studies.</p></details> |  |

To this end, we introduce a hypothesis elimination using loops. Using this, we give reductions from the complement of the periodic domino problem. Moreover, as a corollary via hypothesis eliminations, we also show that the equational theory is $\mathrm{\Pi}^{0}_{1}$-complete for the positive calculus of relations with transitive closure and difference. Additionally, we show that the emptiness problem is PSPACE-complete for the existential calculus of relations with transitive closure.</p></details> |  |

It is interesting both in theory and in practice to investigate which convex cones admit a representation using SOCs, given that they have a strong expressive ability. In this paper, we prove constructively that the cone of sums of nonnegative circuits (SONC) admits a SOC representation. Based on this, we give a new algorithm for unconstrained polynomial optimization via SOC programming. We also provide a hybrid numeric-symbolic scheme which combines the numerical procedure with a rounding-projection algorithm to obtain exact nonnegativity certificates. Numerical experiments demonstrate the efficiency of our algorithm for polynomials with fairly large degree and number of variables.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 7 tables, 6 figures, extended version of the article published in the proceedings of ISSAC 2020. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:1906.06179</p></details> |

Current classifications use the repairs as proxies, but these do not capture the intrinsic nature of the fault. In this paper, we propose a new, direct fault classification scheme based on the control- and data-flow graph representations of programs. Our scheme comprises six control-flow and two data-flow fault classes. We manually apply this scheme to 488 faults from seven projects in the Defects4J dataset. We find that the majority of the faults are assigned between one and three classes. We also find that one of the data-flow fault classes (definition fault) is the most common individual class but that the majority of faults are classified with at least one control-flow fault class. Our proposed classification can be applied to other fault datasets and can be used to improve fault localization and automated program repair techniques for specific fault classes.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 5 figures, EASE 2025 conference</p></details> |

Specifically, we slightly modify the condition satisfied by CBFs and study how the modification can positively impact the closed loop behavior of the system. We show that, QP-based controllers designed using the modified CBF condition preserves the desired properties of QP-based controllers using standard CBF conditions. Furthermore, using the generalized S-procedure for polynomial functions, we formulate the design of the modified CBFs as a Sum-Of-Squares (SOS) program, which can be solved efficiently. Via a numerical example, the proposed CBF design is shown to have superior performance over the standard CBF widely used in existing literature.</p></details> |  |
| **[Providing Information About Implemented Algorithms Improves Program Comprehension: A Controlled Experiment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19225v1)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Various approaches aim to support program comprehension by automatically detecting algorithms in source code. However, no empirical evaluations of their helpfulness have been performed. Objective: To empirically evaluate how algorithm labels - which include the algorithm's name and additional information - impact program comprehension in terms of correctness and time. Method: We conducted a controlled experiment with 56 participants, where the experimental group received code with labeled algorithms. The groups completed exercises designed to measure program comprehension as well as a post-questionnaire on label helpfulness, use cases for algorithm recognition, and reasons for self-implementation of algorithms in practice. Results: Annotating source code with algorithm labels significantly improves program comprehension (p=0.040), with a median improvement of 6 points (~23%), but does not affect completion times (p=0.991). Qualitative analysis revealed that a majority of participants perceived the labels as helpful, especially for recognizing the codes intent. Participants also proposed use cases such as error detection, optimization, and library replacement. Reasons for self-implementing algorithms included library inadequacies, performance needs and avoiding dependencies or licensing costs. Conclusion: This study shows that algorithm labels improve program comprehension, especially for developers with medium programming experience. Our qualitative analysis also sheds light on how participants benefit from the labels, further use cases for algorithm recognition and motivations behind self-implementing algorithms.</p></details> | EASE 2025 |
| **[TileLang: A Composable Tiled Programming Model for AI Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17577v2)** | 2025-04-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern AI workloads rely heavily on optimized computing kernels for both training and inference. These AI kernels follow well-defined data-flow patterns, such as moving tiles between DRAM and SRAM and performing a sequence of computations on those tiles. However, writing high-performance kernels remains complex despite the clarity of these patterns. Achieving peak performance requires careful, hardware-centric optimizations to fully leverage modern accelerators. While domain-specific compilers attempt to reduce the burden of writing high-performance kernels, they often struggle with usability and expressiveness gaps. In this paper, we present TileLang, a generalized tiled programming model for more efficient AI Kernel programming. TileLang decouples scheduling space (thread binding, layout, tensorize and pipeline) from dataflow, and encapsulated them as a set of customization annotations and primitives. This approach allows users to focus on the kernel's data-flow itself, while leaving most other optimizations to compilers. We conduct comprehensive experiments on commonly-used devices, across numerous experiments, our evaluation shows that TileLang can achieve state-of-the-art performance in key kernels, demonstrating that its unified block-and-thread paradigm and transparent scheduling capabilities deliver both the power and flexibility demanded by modern AI system development.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Quadratic Programming Approach to Flight Envelope Protection Using Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18951v1)** | 2025-04-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safe operation of aerospace systems within their prescribed flight envelope is a fundamental requirement for modern flight control systems. Flight envelope protection prevents violations of aerodynamic, structural, and performance constraints, mitigating risks such as stall, excessive loads, and loss of control. Conventional FEP approaches, such as reference clipping via saturation functions and model-based command filtering, impose constraints at the reference input level but often fail to account for closed-loop system dynamics, potentially leading to constraint violations during transients. This paper introduces a new approach to the flight envelope protection problem by employing a quadratic programming-based safety filter using control barrier functions to dynamically enforce flight envelope constraints while preserving control performance. Unlike traditional reference filtering methods, the control barrier function-based safety filter actively ensures strict forward invariance of the safe flight envelope set, integrating seamlessly with existing control architectures. The proposed framework is implemented in a nonlinear missile flight control system and evaluated in a simulated environment. The results demonstrate its ability to prevent constraint violations while minimizing conservatism, offering a robust alternative to existing flight envelope protection methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 12 figures, submitted to the AIAA Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics as an Engineering Note</p></details> |

With the remarkable performance improvements that GPUs enable for deep learning, a natural question arose: can we also implement a search-based program synthesiser on GPUs to achieve similar performance improvements? In this article we discuss our insights on this question, based on recent works~. The goal is to build a synthesiser running on GPUs which takes as input positive and negative example traces and returns a logical formula accepting the positive and rejecting the negative traces. With GPU-friendly programming techniques -- using the semantics of formulae to minimise data movement and reduce data-dependent branching -- our synthesiser scales to significantly larger synthesis problems, and operates much faster than the previous CPU-based state-of-the-art. We believe the insights that make our approach GPU-friendly have wide potential for enhancing the performance of other formal methods (FM) workloads.</p></details> | 10 pages |

The speed of packages through this middle mile network is a key determinant for the ultimate delivery speed to the end user. An important target for a retailer is to maximize the fraction of user orders that can be serviced within one day, i.e., next-day delivery. As such, we formulate the maximization of expected next-day delivery coverage within the middle-mile network as an optimization problem, involving a set of temporal and capacity-based constraints on the network and requiring the use of a black-box model to evaluate the objective function. We design both exact constraint programming (CP) and heuristic random-key optimizer (RKO) approaches, the former of which uses a proxy objective function. We perform experiments on large-scale, real-world problem instances and show that both approaches have merit, in that they can match or outperform the baseline solution, a bespoke greedy solver with integrated local search, in expected next-day delivery coverage. Our experiments focus on two high-level problem definitions, starting with a base problem and then adding more complexity, and also explore the generalization of the solvers across a range of problem instance sizes. We find that a hybrid model using RKO and a bespoke local search protocol performs best on the full problem definition with respect to expected next-day delivery (increase of +50 basis points [bps] over baseline) but can take days to run, whereas the hybrid model using CP and local search is slightly less competitive (+20 bps) but takes only hours to run.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 3 figures, 2 algorithms, 2 tables</p></details> |

The quantum language we are considering can be seen as an extension of PCF, featuring unbounded recursion. The language admits classical and quantum data, as well as a tick operator to account for costs. Our quantum expectation transformer translates such programs into a functional, non-quantum language, enriched with a type and operations over so called cost-structures. By specializing the cost-structure, this methodology makes it possible to study several expectation based properties of quantum programs, such as average case cost, probabilities of events or expected values, in terms of the translated non-quantum programs, this way enabling classical reasoning techniques. As a show-case, we adapt a refinement type system, capable of reasoning on upper-bounds.</p></details> |  |

| **[The Road to Hybrid Quantum Programs: Characterizing the Evolution from Classical to Hybrid Quantum Software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11450v3)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing exhibits the unique capability to natively and efficiently encode various natural phenomena, promising theoretical speedups of several orders of magnitude. However, not all computational tasks can be efficiently executed on quantum machines, giving rise to hybrid systems, where some portions of an application run on classical machines, while others utilize quantum resources. Efforts to identify quantum candidate code fragments that can meaningfully execute on quantum machines primarily rely on static code analysis. Yet, the state-of-the-art in static code analysis for quantum candidates remains in its infancy, with limited applicability to specific frameworks and languages, and a lack of generalizability. Existing methods often involve a trial-and-error approach, relying on the intuition and expertise of computer scientists, resulting in varying identification durations ranging from minutes to days for a single application. This paper aims to systematically formalize the process of identifying quantum candidates and their proper encoding within classical programs. Our work addresses the critical initial step in the development of automated reasoning techniques for code-to-code translation, laying the foundation for more efficient quantum software engineering. Particularly, this study investigates a sociotechnical phenomenon where the starting point is not a problem directly solvable with QC, but rather an existing classical program that addresses the problem. In doing so, it underscores the interdisciplinary nature of QC application development, necessitating collaboration between domain experts, computer scientists, and physicists to harness the potential of quantum computing effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Second International Workshop on Quantum Software Engineering: The Next Evolution</p></details> |
| **[Certifying solutions of degenerate semidefinite programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13625v3)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper deals with the algorithmic aspects of solving feasibility problems of semidefinite programming (SDP), aka linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Since in some SDP instances all feasible solutions have irrational entries, numerical solvers that work with rational numbers can only find an approximate solution. We study the following question: is it possible to certify feasibility of a given SDP using an approximate solution that is sufficiently close to some exact solution? Existing approaches make the assumption that there exist rational feasible solutions (and use techniques such as rounding and lattice reduction algorithms). We propose an alternative approach that does not need this assumption. More specifically, we show how to construct a system of polynomial equations whose set of real solutions is guaranteed to have an isolated correct solution (assuming that the target exact solution is maximum-rank). This allows, in particular, to use algorithms from real algebraic geometry for solving systems of polynomial equations, yielding a hybrid (or symbolic-numerical) method for SDPs. We experimentally compare it with a pure symbolic method; the hybrid method was able to certify feasibility of many SDP instances on which the exact method failed. Our approach may have further applications, such as refining an approximate solution using methods of numerical algebraic geometry for systems of polynomial equations.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 1 table; accepted to SIAM J.

| **[Prompts Are Programs Too! Understanding How Developers Build Software Containing Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12447v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative pre-trained models power intelligent software features used by millions of users controlled by developer-written natural language prompts. Despite the impact of prompt-powered software, little is known about its development process and its relationship to programming. In this work, we argue that some prompts are programs and that the development of prompts is a distinct phenomenon in programming known as "prompt programming". We develop an understanding of prompt programming using Straussian grounded theory through interviews with 20 developers engaged in prompt development across a variety of contexts, models, domains, and prompt structures. We contribute 15 observations to form a preliminary understanding of current prompt programming practices. For example, rather than building mental models of code, prompt programmers develop mental models of the foundation model (FM)'s behavior on the prompt by interacting with the FM. While prior research shows that experts have well-formed mental models, we find that prompt programmers who have developed dozens of prompts still struggle to develop reliable mental models. Our observations show that prompt programming differs from traditional software development, motivating the creation of prompt programming tools and providing implications for software engineering stakeholders.</p></details> | Accepted to FSE'25 |

However, most existing code generation models mainly focus on a single or a few programming languages, resulting in unsatisfactory performance in a multilingual environment. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning can significantly improve the performance of the model without the need for retraining or fine-tuning the code generation model by reasonably decomposing complex code generation tasks into multiple subtasks and gradually deriving solutions for each subtask. Nevertheless, the existing CoT generation methods mainly concentrate on Python code, and the performance on other programming languages remains unclear. To fill this gap, we first constructed a CoT generation dataset for 12 programming languages through multi-agent technology. On this basis, we proposed a CoT generation method MSCoT applicable to multiple programming languages. By introducing CoT into the code generation large model, the performance of the code generation large model in a multilingual environment can be improved. Through large-scale empirical research, we compared the generalization abilities of MSCoT and the existing CoT generation methods on multiple programming languages and proved the effectiveness of MSCoT for multiple programming languages. In addition, we also designed a human study to prove the quality of the CoT generated by MSCoT. Finally, we opensourced the model and dataset of MSCoT to promote the research on CoT generation for multiple programming languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in ijcnn 2025</p></details> |

Our work extends BIT1 hybrid parallelization by integrating MPI with OpenMP and OpenACC, focusing on asynchronous multi-GPU programming. Results show significant performance gains: 16 MPI ranks plus OpenMP threads reduced runtime by 53% on a petascale EuroHPC supercomputer, while OpenACC multicore achieved a 58% reduction. At 64 MPI ranks, OpenACC outperformed OpenMP, improving the particle mover function by 24%. On MareNostrum 5, OpenACC async(n) delivered strong performance, but OpenMP asynchronous multi-GPU approach proved more effective at extreme scaling, maintaining efficiency up to 400 GPUs. Speedup and parallel efficiency (PE) studies revealed OpenMP asynchronous multi-GPU achieving 8.77x speedup (54.81% PE), surpassing OpenACC (8.14x speedup, 50.87% PE). While PE declined at high node counts due to communication overhead, asynchronous execution mitigated scalability bottlenecks. OpenMP nowait and depend clauses improved GPU performance via efficient data transfer and task management. Using NVIDIA Nsight tools, we confirmed BIT1 efficiency for large-scale plasma simulations. OpenMP asynchronous multi-GPU implementation delivered exceptional performance in portability, high throughput, and GPU utilization, positioning BIT1 for exascale supercomputing and advancing fusion energy research. MareNostrum 5 brings us closer to achieving exascale performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the Journal of Computational Science (ICCS 2024 Special Issue) prepared in English, formatted in Springer LNCS template and consists of 32 pages, which includes the main text, references, and figures</p></details> |

Rel is a new relational language whose key design goal is to go beyond this paradigm with features that allow for programming in the large, making it possible to fully describe end to end application semantics. With the new approach we can model the semantics of entire enterprise applications relationally, which helps significantly reduce architecture complexity and avoid the well-known impedance mismatch problem. This paradigm shift is enabled by 50 years of database research, making it possible to revisit the sublanguage/host language paradigm, starting from the fundamental principles. We present the main features of Rel: those that give it the power to express traditional query language operations and those that are designed to grow the language and allow programming in the large.</p></details> |  |
| **[Catalytic Computing and Register Programs Beyond Log-Depth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17412v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a seminal work, Buhrman et al. (STOC 2014) defined the class $CSPACE(s,c)$ of problems solvable in space $s$ with an additional catalytic tape of size $c$, which is a tape whose initial content must be restored at the end of the computation. They showed that uniform $TC^1$ circuits are computable in catalytic logspace, i.e., $CL=CSPACE(O(\log{n}), 2^{O(\log{n})})$, thus giving strong evidence that catalytic space gives $L$ strict additional power. Their study focuses on an arithmetic model called register programs, which has been a focal point in development since then. Understanding $CL$ remains a major open problem, as $TC^1$ remains the most powerful containment to date. In this work, we study the power of catalytic space and register programs to compute circuits of larger depth. Using register programs, we show that for every $\epsilon > 0$, $SAC^2 \subseteq CSPACE\left(O\left(\frac{\log^2{n}}{\log\log{n}}\right), 2^{O(\log^{1+\epsilon} n)}\right)$ This is an $O(\log \log n)$ factor improvement on the free space needed to compute $SAC^2$, which can be accomplished with near-polynomial catalytic space. We also exhibit non-trivial register programs for matrix powering, which is a further step towards showing $NC^2 \subseteq CL$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Programmed I/O for Fast Devices, Cheap Cores, and Coherent Interconnects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08141v3)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional wisdom holds that an efficient interface between an OS running on a CPU and a high-bandwidth I/O device should use Direct Memory Access (DMA) to offload data transfer, descriptor rings for buffering and queuing, and interrupts for asynchrony between cores and device. In this paper we question this wisdom in the light of two trends: modern and emerging cache-coherent interconnects like CXL3.0, and workloads, particularly microservices and serverless computing. Like some others before us, we argue that the assumptions of the DMA-based model are obsolete, and in many use-cases programmed I/O, where the CPU explicitly transfers data and control information to and from a device via loads and stores, delivers a more efficient system. However, we push this idea much further. We show, in a real hardware implementation, the gains in latency for fine-grained communication achievable using an open cache-coherence protocol which exposes cache transitions to a smart device, and that throughput is competitive with DMA over modern interconnects. We also demonstrate three use-cases: fine-grained RPC-style invocation of functions on an accelerator, offloading of operators in a streaming dataflow engine, and a network interface targeting serverless functions, comparing our use of coherence with both traditional DMA-style interaction and a highly-optimized implementation using memory-mapped programmed I/O over PCIe.</p></details> |  |
| **[EduBot -- Can LLMs Solve Personalized Learning and Programming Assignments?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17824v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is revolutionizing the process of writing code. General and code LLMs have shown impressive performance in generating standalone functions and code-completion tasks with one-shot queries. However, the ability to solve comprehensive programming tasks with recursive requests and bug fixes remains questionable. In this paper, we propose EduBot, an intelligent automated assistant system that combines conceptual knowledge teaching, end-to-end code development, personalized programming through recursive prompt-driven methods, and debugging with limited human interventions powered by LLMs. We show that EduBot can solve complicated programming tasks consisting of sub-tasks with increasing difficulties ranging from conceptual to coding questions by recursive automatic prompt-driven systems without finetuning on LLMs themselves. To further evaluate EduBot's performance, we design and conduct a benchmark suite consisting of 20 scenarios in algorithms, machine learning, and real-world problems. The result shows that EduBot can complete most scenarios in less than 20 minutes. Based on the benchmark suites, we perform a comparative study to take different LLMs as the backbone and to verify EduBot's compatibility and robustness across LLMs with varying capabilities. We believe that EduBot is an exploratory approach to explore the potential of pre-trained LLMs in multi-step reasoning and code generation for solving personalized assignments with knowledge learning and code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at AAAI 2025 AI4EDU Workshop</p></details> |

Library-level CP implementations, like HasChor, integrate well with mainstream programming languages but have several limitations: Their conditionals require extra communication; they require specific host-language features (e.g., monads); and they lack support for programming patterns that are essential for implementing realistic distributed applications. We make three contributions to library-level CP to specifically address these challenges. First, we propose and formalize conclaves and multiply-located values, which enable efficient conditionals in library-level CP without redundant communication. Second, we propose end-point projection as dependency injection, a design pattern that enables library-level CP in host languages without support for monads. Third, we propose census polymorphism, a technique for abstracting over the number of participants in a choreography. We demonstrate these contributions via implementations in Haskell, Rust, and TypeScript.</p></details> | Presenting at PLDI25 |
| **[LLM impact on BLV programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17018v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming integral to a wide range of tools, tasks, and problem-solving processes, especially in software development. Originally designed for natural language processing tasks such as text generation, LLMs are increasingly being used to assist both professionals and students in writing code. This growing reliance on LLM-based tools is reshaping programming workflows and task execution. In this study, we explore the impact of these technologies on blind and low-vision (BLV) developers. Our review of existing literature indicates that while LLMs help mitigate some of the challenges faced by BLV programmers, they also introduce new forms of inaccessibility. We conducted an evaluation of five popular LLM-powered integrated development environments (IDEs), assessing their performance across a comprehensive set of programming tasks. Our findings highlight several unsupported scenarios, instances of incorrect model output, and notable limitations in interaction support for specific tasks. Through observing BLV developers as they engaged in coding activities, we uncovered key interaction barriers that go beyond model accuracy or code generation quality. This paper outlines the challenges and corresponding opportunities for improving accessibility in the context of generative AI-assisted programming. Addressing these issues can meaningfully enhance the programming experience for BLV developers. As the generative AI revolution continues to unfold, it must also address the unique burdens faced by this community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ASSETS 2025</p></details> |

Anyone who ignores that it is humans who use these tools risks building tools that are useless, or worse, harmful. To ensure our data engineering tools are based on solid foundations, we performed a systematic review of common programming mistakes in data engineering. We focus on programming beginners (students) by analyzing both the limited literature specific to data engineering mistakes and general programming mistakes in languages commonly used in data engineering (Python, SQL, Java). Through analysis of 21 publications spanning from 2003 to 2024, we synthesized these complementary sources into a comprehensive classification that captures both general programming challenges and domain-specific data engineering mistakes. This classification provides an empirical foundation for future tool development and educational strategies. We believe our systematic categorization will help researchers, practitioners, and educators better understand and address the challenges faced by novice data engineers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 IEEE/ACM 37th International Conference on Software Engineering Education and Training (CSEE&T)</p></details> |
| **[Program Evaluation with Remotely Sensed Outcomes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10959v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Economists often estimate treatment effects in experiments using remotely sensed variables (RSVs), e.g. satellite images or mobile phone activity, in place of directly measured economic outcomes. A common practice is to use an observational sample to train a predictor of the economic outcome from the RSV, and then to use its predictions as the outcomes in the experiment. We show that this method is biased whenever the RSV is post-outcome, i.e. if variation in the economic outcome causes variation in the RSV. In program evaluation, changes in poverty or environmental quality cause changes in satellite images, but not vice versa. As our main result, we nonparametrically identify the treatment effect by formalizing the intuition that underlies common practice: the conditional distribution of the RSV given the outcome and treatment is stable across the samples.Based on our identifying formula, we find that the efficient representation of RSVs for causal inference requires three predictions rather than one. Valid inference does not require any rate conditions on RSV predictions, justifying the use of complex deep learning algorithms with unknown statistical properties. We re-analyze the effect of an anti-poverty program in India using satellite images.</p></details> |  |
| **[GENCNIPPET: Automated Generation of Code Snippets for Supporting Programming Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16292v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Software developers often ask questions on Technical Q&A forums like Stack Overflow (SO) to seek solutions to their programming-related problems (e.g., errors and unexpected behavior of code). Problem: Many questions miss required code snippets due to the lack of readily available code, time constraints, employer restrictions, confidentiality concerns, or uncertainty about what code to share. Unfortunately, missing but required code snippets prevent questions from getting prompt and appropriate solutions. Objective: We plan to introduce GENCNIPPET, a tool designed to integrate with SO's question submission system. GENCNIPPET will generate relevant code examples (when required) to support questions for their timely solutions. Methodology: We first downloaded the SO April 2024 data dump, which contains 1.94 million questions related to Python that have code snippets and 1.43 million questions related to Java. Then, we filter these questions to identify those that genuinely require code snippets using a state-of-the-art machine learning model. Next, we select questions with positive scores to ensure high-quality data. Our plan is to fine-tune Llama-3 models (e.g., Llama-3-8B), using 80% of the selected questions for training and 10% for validation. The primary reasons for choosing Llama models are their open-source accessibility and robust fine-tuning capabilities, which are essential for deploying a freely accessible tool. GENCNIPPET will be integrated with the SO question submission system as a browser plugin. It will communicate with the fine-tuned model to generate code snippets tailored to the target questions. The effectiveness of the generated code examples will be assessed using automatic evaluation against ground truth, user perspectives, and live (wild) testing in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR 2025 Registered Reports Track)</p></details> |
| **[Program Skeletons for Automated Program Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07483v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating software between programming languages is a challenging task, for which automated techniques have been elusive and hard to scale up to larger programs. A key difficulty in cross-language translation is that one has to re-express the intended behavior of the source program into idiomatic constructs of a different target language. This task needs abstracting away from the source language-specific details, while keeping the overall functionality the same. In this work, we propose a novel and systematic approach for making such translation amenable to automation based on a framework we call program skeletons. A program skeleton retains the high-level structure of the source program by abstracting away and effectively summarizing lower-level concrete code fragments, which can be mechanically translated to the target programming language. A skeleton, by design, permits many different ways of filling in the concrete implementation for fragments, which can work in conjunction with existing data-driven code synthesizers. Most importantly, skeletons can conceptually enable sound decomposition, i.e., if each individual fragment is correctly translated, taken together with the mechanically translated skeleton, the final translated program is deemed to be correct as a whole. We present a prototype system called Skel embodying the idea of skeleton-based translation from Python to JavaScript. Our results show promising scalability compared to prior works. For 9 real-world Python programs, some with more than about 1k lines of code, 95% of their code fragments can be automatically translated, while about 5% require manual effort. All the final translations are correct with respect to whole-program test suites.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by PLDI 2025 (46th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation)</p></details> |
| **[A Time Series Analysis of Malware Uploads to Programming Language Ecosystems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15695v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software ecosystems built around programming languages have greatly facilitated software development. At the same time, their security has increasingly been acknowledged as a problem. To this end, the paper examines the previously overlooked longitudinal aspects of software ecosystem security, focusing on malware uploaded to six popular programming language ecosystems. The dataset examined is based on the new Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV) database. According to the results, records about detected malware uploads in the database have recently surpassed those addressing vulnerabilities in packages distributed in the ecosystems. In the early 2025 even up to 80% of all entries in the OSV have been about malware. Regarding time series analysis of malware frequencies and their shares to all database entries, good predictions are available already by relatively simple autoregressive models using the numbers of ecosystems, security advisories, and media and other articles as predictors. With these results and the accompanying discussion, the paper improves and advances the understanding of the thus far overlooked longitudinal aspects of ecosystems and malware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to TrustBus@ARES</p></details> |

Processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures alleviate these costs by moving computation closer to memory, reducing data movement overheads. UPMEM is the first commercially available PIM system, featuring thousands of in-order processors (DPUs) integrated within DRAM modules. However, a programming UPMEM-based system remains challenging due to the need for explicit data management and workload partitioning across DPUs. We introduce DaPPA (data-parallel processing-in-memory architecture), a programming framework that eases the programmability of UPMEM systems by automatically managing data movement, memory allocation, and workload distribution. The key idea behind DaPPA is to leverage a high-level data-parallel pattern-based programming interface to abstract hardware complexities away from the programmer. DaPPA comprises three main components: (i) data-parallel pattern APIs, a collection of five primary data-parallel pattern primitives that allow the programmer to express data transformations within an application; (ii) a dataflow programming interface, which allows the programmer to define how data moves across data-parallel patterns; and (iii) a dynamic template-based compilation, which leverages code skeletons and dynamic code transformations to convert data-parallel patterns implemented via the dataflow programming interface into an optimized UPMEM binary. We evaluate DaPPA using six workloads from the PrIM benchmark suite on a real UPMEM system. Compared to hand-tuned implementations, DaPPA improves end-to-end performance by 2.1x, on average, and reduces programming complexity (measured in lines-of-code) by 94%. Our results demonstrate that DaPPA is an effective programming framework for efficient and user-friendly programming on UPMEM systems.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents an optimization framework for the joint multimodal transit frequency and SAV fleet size problem, a variant of the transit network frequency setting problem. The objective is to maximize total transit ridership (including SAV-fed trips and subtracting boarding rejections) across multiple time periods under budget constraints, considering endogenous mode choice (transit, point-to-point SAVs, driving) and route selection, while allowing for strategic route removal by setting frequencies to zero. Due to the problem's non-linear, non-convex nature and the computational challenges of large-scale networks, we develop a hybrid solution approach that combines a metaheuristic approach (particle swarm optimization) with nonlinear programming for local solution refinement. To ensure computational tractability, the framework integrates analytical approximation models for SAV waiting times based on fleet utilization, multimodal network assignment for route choice, and multinomial logit mode choice behavior, bypassing the need for computationally intensive simulations within the main optimization loop. Applied to the Chicago metropolitan area's multimodal network, our method illustrates a 33.3% increase in transit ridership through optimized transit route frequencies and SAV integration, particularly enhancing off-peak service accessibility and strategically reallocating resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, a previous version is accepted for presentation at the Conference on Advanced Systems in Public Transport and TransitData 2025 in Kyoto, Japan on 1 - 4 July 2025</p></details> |

It is a key requirement for formal specifications to leave some details of a system's behavior unspecified so that future implementation changes can be accommodated, and yet it is nonetheless expected that these choices would not be made based on confidential information the system handles. This paper formalizes that notion using omnisemantics and plain single-copy assertions, giving for the first time a specification of what it means for a nondeterministic program to be constant-time or more generally to avoid leaking (a part of) its inputs. We use this theory to prove data-leak-free execution of core cryptographic routines compiled from Bedrock2 C to RISC-V machine code, showing that the smooth specification and proof experience omnisemantics provides for nondeterminism extends to constant-time properties in the same setting. We also study variants of the key program-compiler contract, highlighting pitfalls of tempting simplifications and subtle consequences of how inputs to nondeterministic choices are constrained. Our results are backed by modular program-logic and compiler-correctness theorems, and they integrate into a neat end-to-end theorem in the Coq proof assistant.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 1 table, 0 figures. to be published in PLDI 2025 proceedings</p></details> |

The while-language we consider is a simple computation model that can simulate (and be simulated by) Turing Machines with a quadratic time and constant space blow-up. Our framework derives while-programs from functional programs written in a subset of Isabelle/HOL, namely tail-recursive functions with first-order arguments and algebraic datatypes. As far as we are aware, it is the first framework targeting a computation model that is reasonable in time and space from a complexity-theoretic perspective.</p></details> |  |
| **[MaCTG: Multi-Agent Collaborative Thought Graph for Automatic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19245v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based approaches have demonstrated strong problem-solving capabilities across various domains. However, in automatic programming, a single LLM is typically limited to function-level code generation, while multi-agent systems composed of multiple LLMs often suffer from inefficient task planning. This lack of structured coordination can lead to cascading hallucinations, where accumulated errors across agents result in suboptimal workflows and excessive computational costs. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MaCTG (Multi-Agent Collaborative Thought Graph), a novel multi-agent framework that employs a dynamic graph structure to facilitate precise task allocation and controlled collaboration among LLM agents. MaCTG autonomously assigns agent roles based on programming requirements, dynamically refines task distribution through context-aware adjustments, and systematically verifies and integrates project-level code, effectively reducing hallucination errors and improving overall accuracy. MaCTG enhances cost-effectiveness by implementing a hybrid LLM deployment, where proprietary models handle complex reasoning, while open-source models are used for routine coding and validation tasks. To evaluate MaCTG's effectiveness, we applied it to traditional image processing auto-programming tasks, achieving a state-of-the-art accuracy of 83.33%. Additionally, by leveraging its hybrid LLM configuration, MaCTG significantly reduced operational costs by 89.09% compared to existing multi-agent frameworks, demonstrating its efficiency, scalability, and real-world applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mathematical Programming Models for Exact and Interpretable Formulation of Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14356v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a unified mixed-integer programming framework for training sparse and interpretable neural networks. We develop exact formulations for both fully connected and convolutional architectures by modeling nonlinearities such as ReLU activations through binary variables and encoding structural sparsity via filter- and layer-level pruning constraints. The resulting models integrate parameter learning, architecture selection, and structural regularization within a single optimization problem, yielding globally optimal solutions with respect to a composite objective that balances prediction accuracy, weight sparsity, and architectural compactness. The mixed-integer programming formulation accommodates piecewise-linear operations, including max pooling and activation gating, and permits precise enforcement of logic-based or domain-specific constraints. By incorporating considerations of interpretability, sparsity, and verifiability directly into the training process, the proposed framework bridges a range of research areas including explainable artificial intelligence, symbolic reasoning, and formal verification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ordered Completion for Non-Locally Tight mini-gringo Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14252v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Completion is a well-known transformation that captures the stable model semantics of logic programs by turning a program into a set of first-order definitions. Stable models are models of the completion, but not all models of the completion are stable models. For tight programs (programs without positive recursion) the two semantics coincide. Recently this correspondence was extended to locally tight programs, which avoid non-terminating recursion. However, unlike tightness, local tightness cannot be checked with simple syntactic methods. Completion is crucial for verifying answer set programs, especially for external equivalence: a form of equivalence based on selected output predicates under certain inputs. Standard equivalence and adherence to a first-order specification are special cases of external equivalence. The anthem verification tool has two limitations for checking external equivalence: (1) there is no way to check local tightness automatically, and (2) it is not possible to verify programs that are not locally tight. Therefore, alternatives to completion are of interest. This thesis investigates ordered completion, introduced in [Asuncion et al., 2012], which captures stable models of arbitrary logic programs, but only for finite models. This work extends ordered completion to the mini-gringo language (a subset of the language used by the clingo solver). Additionally, it introduces a modification of ordered completion to handle infinite stable models. This extended ordered completion is implemented in anthem as a translation, and initial experiments demonstrate its use for verifying simple logic programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master's Thesis submitted at the University of Potsdam</p></details> |

Foundational tasks here involve selecting markets, plants, warehouses, and distribution centers to maximize profits while considering related constraints. Based on a variation of the quadratic assignment problem, we propose a novel integer programming formula that significantly reduces the variables. Our model incorporates several realistic features, including transportation costs and upper bounds on facilities at each level. It accounts for one-time fixed costs associated with selecting each facility. To solve this complex problem, we develop and experimentally test two solution procedures: a multi-start greedy heuristic and a multi-start tabu search. We conduct extensive sensitivity analyses on the results to assess the reliability of proposed algorithms. This study contributes to improved solution methods for large-scale 4L-FLPs, providing a valuable tool for supply chain maturity.</p></details> | 38 pages |

It provides a systematic and rigorous approach to software development through stepwise refinement, where a high-level abstract specification is progressively transformed into an implementation that meets the desired requirements. Central to this technique is the notion of a refinement order, which ensures that each refinement step preserves program correctness. Different orders can be defined with respect to partial and total correctness, as well as for deterministic and nondeterministic programs. In the realm of quantum programs, the theory becomes even more intricate due to the existence of various quantum state predicates, leading to different notions of specifications. This paper thoroughly explores different refinement orders for quantum programs and examines the relationships between them.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unsupervised Machine Learning Hybrid Approach Integrating Linear Programming in Loss Function: A Robust Optimization Technique](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09967v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel hybrid approach that integrates linear programming (LP) within the loss function of an unsupervised machine learning model. By leveraging the strengths of both optimization techniques and machine learning, this method introduces a robust framework for solving complex optimization problems where traditional methods may fall short. The proposed approach encapsulates the constraints and objectives of a linear programming problem directly into the loss function, guiding the learning process to adhere to these constraints while optimizing the desired outcomes. This technique not only preserves the interpretability of linear programming but also benefits from the flexibility and adaptability of machine learning, making it particularly well-suited for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniAP: Unifying Inter- and Intra-Layer Automatic Parallelism by Mixed Integer Quadratic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.16375v6)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed learning is commonly used for training deep learning models, especially large models. In distributed learning, manual parallelism (MP) methods demand considerable human effort and have limited flexibility. Hence, automatic parallelism (AP) methods have recently been proposed for automating the parallel strategy optimization process. Existing AP methods suffer from sub-optimal solutions because they do not jointly optimize the two categories of parallel strategies (i.e., inter-layer parallelism and intra-layer parallelism). In this paper, we propose a novel AP method called UniAP, which unifies inter- and intra-layer automatic parallelism by mixed integer quadratic programming. To the best of our knowledge, UniAP is the first parallel method that can jointly optimize the two categories of parallel strategies to find an optimal solution. Experimental results show that UniAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 3.80$\times$ in throughput and reduces strategy optimization time by up to 107$\times$ across five Transformer-based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures, CVPR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Natural Language Outlines for Code: Literate Programming in the LLM Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04820v4)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose using natural language outlines as a novel modality and interaction surface for providing AI assistance to developers throughout the software development process. An NL outline for a code function comprises multiple statements written in concise prose, which partition the code and summarize its main ideas in the style of literate programming. Crucially, we find that modern LLMs can generate accurate and high-quality NL outlines in practice. Moreover, NL outlines enable a bidirectional sync between code and NL, where a developer can change either code or NL and have the LLM automatically update the other. We discuss many use cases for NL outlines: they can accelerate understanding and navigation of code and diffs, simplify code maintenance, augment code search, steer code generation, and more. We then propose and compare multiple LLM prompting techniques for generating outlines and ask professional developers to judge outline quality. Finally, we present two case studies applying NL outlines toward code review and malware detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to FSE'25 Industry Track</p></details> |
| **[Unlocking LLM Repair Capabilities in Low-Resource Programming Languages Through Cross-Language Translation and Multi-Agent Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22512v3)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in leveraging LLMs for APR have demonstrated impressive capabilities in fixing software defects. However, current LLM-based approaches predominantly focus on mainstream programming languages like Java and Python, neglecting less prevalent but emerging languages such as Rust due to expensive training resources, limited datasets, and insufficient community support. This narrow focus creates a significant gap in repair capabilities across the programming language spectrum, where the full potential of LLMs for comprehensive multilingual program repair remains largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel cross-language program repair approach LANTERN that leverages LLMs' differential proficiency across languages through a multi-agent iterative repair paradigm. Our technique strategically translates defective code from languages where LLMs exhibit weaker repair capabilities to languages where they demonstrate stronger performance, without requiring additional training. A key innovation of our approach is an LLM-based decision-making system that dynamically selects optimal target languages based on bug characteristics and continuously incorporates feedback from previous repair attempts. We evaluate our method on xCodeEval, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 5,068 bugs across 11 programming languages. Results demonstrate significant enhancement in repair effectiveness, particularly for underrepresented languages, with Rust showing a 22.09% improvement in Pass@10 metrics. Our research provides the first empirical evidence that cross-language translation significantly expands the repair capabilities of LLMs and effectively bridges the performance gap between programming languages with different levels of popularity, opening new avenues for truly language-agnostic automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Productive Quantum Programming Needs Better Abstract Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00718v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An effective, accessible abstraction hierarchy has made using and programming computers possible for people across all disciplines. Establishing such a hierarchy for quantum programming is an outstanding challenge, especially due to a proliferation of different conventions and the rapid pace of innovation. One critical portion of the hierarchy is the abstract machine, the layer that separates a programmer's mental model of the hardware from its physical realization. Drawing on historical parallels in classical computing, we explain why having the "right" quantum abstract machine (QAM) is essential for making progress in the field and propose a novel framework for evaluating QAMs based on a set of desirable criteria. These criteria capture aspects of a QAM such as universality, compactness, expressiveness, and composability, which aid in the representation of quantum programs. By defining this framework we take steps toward defining an optimal QAM. We further apply our framework to survey the landscape of existing proposals, draw comparisons, and assess them based on our criteria. While these proposals share many common strengths, we find that each falls short of our ideal. Our framework and our findings set a direction for subsequent efforts to define a future QAM that is both straightforward to map to a variety of quantum computers, and provides a stable abstraction for quantum software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
