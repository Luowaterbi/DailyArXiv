| **[CodePlot-CoT: Mathematical Visual Reasoning by Thinking with Code-Driven Images](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11718v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs) have shown significant progress in mathematical reasoning, yet they still face a critical bottleneck with problems requiring visual assistance, such as drawing auxiliary lines or plotting functions to solve the problems. Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for "thinking with images" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into images as "visual thought", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples. Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures into codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model for solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model achieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully validating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our work opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides the community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and strong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at https://github.com/HKU-MMLab/Math-VR-CodePlot-CoT.</p></details> |  |
| **[ORCAS Codes: A Flexible Generalization of Polar Codes with Low-Complexity Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.09744v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the need for channel codes with low-complexity soft-decision decoding algorithms, we consider the recursive Plotkin concatenation of optimal low-rate and high-rate codes based on simplex codes and their duals. These component codes come with low-complexity maximum likelihood (ML) decoding which, in turn, enables efficient successive cancellation (SC)-based decoding. As a result, the proposed optimally recursively concatenated simplex (ORCAS) codes achieve a performance that is at least as good as that of polar codes. For practical parameters, the proposed construction significantly outperforms polar codes in terms of block error rate by up to 0.5 dB while maintaining similar decoding complexity. Furthermore, the codes offer greater flexibility in codeword length than conventional polar codes.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures.

| **[CodeWatcher: IDE Telemetry Data Extraction Tool for Understanding Coding Interactions with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11536v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how developers interact with code generation tools (CGTs) requires detailed, real-time data on programming behavior which is often difficult to collect without disrupting workflow. We present \textit{CodeWatcher}, a lightweight, unobtrusive client-server system designed to capture fine-grained interaction events from within the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor. \textit{CodeWatcher} logs semantically meaningful events such as insertions made by CGTs, deletions, copy-paste actions, and focus shifts, enabling continuous monitoring of developer activity without modifying user workflows. The system comprises a VS Code plugin, a Python-based RESTful API, and a MongoDB backend, all containerized for scalability and ease of deployment. By structuring and timestamping each event, \textit{CodeWatcher} enables post-hoc reconstruction of coding sessions and facilitates rich behavioral analyses, including how and when CGTs are used during development. This infrastructure is crucial for supporting research on responsible AI, developer productivity, and the human-centered evaluation of CGTs.

| **[ReLook: Vision-Grounded RL with a Multimodal LLM Critic for Agentic Web Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11498v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at algorithmic code generation, they struggle with front-end development, where correctness is judged on rendered pixels and interaction. We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool. During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable, vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference, we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle, keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains. Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference decoupling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Rate Coding: Surrogate Gradients Enable Spike Timing Learning in Spiking Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16043v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the extent to which Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) trained with Surrogate Gradient Descent (Surrogate GD), with and without delay learning, can learn from precise spike timing beyond firing rates. We first design synthetic tasks isolating intra-neuron inter-spike intervals and cross-neuron synchrony under matched spike counts. On more complex spike-based speech recognition datasets (Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) and Spiking Speech Commands (SSC), we construct variants where spike count information is eliminated and only timing information remains, and show that Surrogate GD-trained SNNs are able to perform significantly above chance whereas purely rate-based models perform at chance level. We further evaluate robustness under biologically inspired perturbations -- including Gaussian jitter per spike or per-neuron, and spike deletion -- revealing consistent but perturbation-specific degradation. Networks show a sharp performance drop when spike sequences are reversed in time, with a larger drop in performance from SNNs trained with delays, indicating that these networks are more human-like in terms of behaviour. To facilitate further studies of temporal coding, we have released our modified SHD and SSC datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[List Decoding Reed--Solomon Codes in the Lee, Euclidean, and Other Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11453v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reed--Solomon error-correcting codes are ubiquitous across computer science and information theory, with applications in cryptography, computational complexity, communication and storage systems, and more. Most works on efficient error correction for these codes, like the celebrated Berlekamp--Welch unique decoder and the (Guruswami--)Sudan list decoders, are focused on measuring error in the Hamming metric, which simply counts the number of corrupted codeword symbols. However, for some applications, other metrics that depend on the specific values of the errors may be more appropriate. This work gives a polynomial-time algorithm that list decodes (generalized) Reed--Solomon codes over prime fields in $\ell_p$ (semi)metrics, for any $0 < p \leq 2$. Compared to prior algorithms for the Lee ($\ell_1$) and Euclidean ($\ell_2$) metrics, ours decodes to arbitrarily large distances (for correspondingly small rates), and has better distance-rate tradeoffs for all decoding distances above some moderate thresholds. We also prove lower bounds on the $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$ minimum distances of a certain natural subclass of GRS codes, which establishes that our list decoder is actually a unique decoder for many parameters of interest. Finally, we analyze our algorithm's performance under random Laplacian and Gaussian errors, and show that it supports even larger rates than for corresponding amounts of worst-case error in $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$ (respectively).</p></details> | 26 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Large Language Models Are Effective Code Watermarkers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11251v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread use of large language models (LLMs) and open-source code has raised ethical and security concerns regarding the distribution and attribution of source code, including unauthorized redistribution, license violations, and misuse of code for malicious purposes. Watermarking has emerged as a promising solution for source attribution, but existing techniques rely heavily on hand-crafted transformation rules, abstract syntax tree (AST) manipulation, or task-specific training, limiting their scalability and generality across languages. Moreover, their robustness against attacks remains limited. To address these limitations, we propose CodeMark-LLM, an LLM-driven watermarking framework that embeds watermark into source code without compromising its semantics or readability. CodeMark-LLM consists of two core components: (i) Semantically Consistent Embedding module that applies functionality-preserving transformations to encode watermark bits, and (ii) Differential Comparison Extraction module that identifies the applied transformations by comparing the original and watermarked code. Leveraging the cross-lingual generalization ability of LLM, CodeMark-LLM avoids language-specific engineering and training pipelines. Extensive experiments across diverse programming languages and attack scenarios demonstrate its robustness, effectiveness, and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Line-level Localization Ability of Learning-based Code Vulnerability Detection Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11202v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the extremely concerning problem of software vulnerability, system security is often entrusted to Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Despite their now established detection capabilities, such models are limited by design to flagging the entire input source code function as vulnerable, rather than precisely localizing the concerned code lines. However, the detection granularity is crucial to support human operators during software development, ensuring that such predictions reflect the true code semantics to help debug, evaluate, and fix the detected vulnerabilities. To address this issue, recent work made progress toward improving the detector's localization ability, thus narrowing down the vulnerability detection "window" and providing more fine-grained predictions. Such approaches, however, implicitly disregard the presence of spurious correlations and biases in the data, which often predominantly influence the performance of ML algorithms. In this work, we investigate how detectors comply with this requirement by proposing an explainability-based evaluation procedure. Our approach, defined as Detection Alignment (DA), quantifies the agreement between the input source code lines that most influence the prediction and the actual localization of the vulnerability as per the ground truth. Through DA, which is model-agnostic and adaptable to different detection tasks, not limited to our use case, we analyze multiple learning-based vulnerability detectors and datasets. As a result, we show how the predictions of such models are consistently biased by non-vulnerable lines, ultimately highlighting the high impact of biases and spurious correlations. The code is available at https://github.com/pralab/vuln-localization-eval.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[RAG-Pull: Imperceptible Attacks on RAG Systems for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11195v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) increases the reliability and trustworthiness of the LLM response and reduces hallucination by eliminating the need for model retraining. It does so by adding external data into the LLM's context. We develop a new class of black-box attack, RAG-Pull, that inserts hidden UTF characters into queries or external code repositories, redirecting retrieval toward malicious code, thereby breaking the models' safety alignment. We observe that query and code perturbations alone can shift retrieval toward attacker-controlled snippets, while combined query-and-target perturbations achieve near-perfect success. Once retrieved, these snippets introduce exploitable vulnerabilities such as remote code execution and SQL injection. RAG-Pull's minimal perturbations can alter the model's safety alignment and increase preference towards unsafe code, therefore opening up a new class of attacks on LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[TypePilot: Leveraging the Scala Type System for Secure LLM-generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11151v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable proficiency in code generation tasks across various programming languages. However, their outputs often contain subtle but critical vulnerabilities, posing significant risks when deployed in security-sensitive or mission-critical systems. This paper introduces TypePilot, an agentic AI framework designed to enhance the security and robustness of LLM-generated code by leveraging strongly typed and verifiable languages, using Scala as a representative example. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in two settings: formal verification with the Stainless framework and general-purpose secure code generation. Our experiments with leading open-source LLMs reveal that while direct code generation often fails to enforce safety constraints, just as naive prompting for more secure code, our type-focused agentic pipeline substantially mitigates input validation and injection vulnerabilities. The results demonstrate the potential of structured, type-guided LLM workflows to improve the SotA of the trustworthiness of automated code generation in high-assurance domains.</p></details> |  |

| **[Automatically Generating Questions About Scratch Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11658v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When learning to program, students are usually assessed based on the code they wrote. However, the mere completion of a programming task does not guarantee actual comprehension of the underlying concepts. Asking learners questions about the code they wrote has therefore been proposed as a means to assess program comprehension. As creating targeted questions for individual student programs can be tedious and challenging, prior work has proposed to generate such questions automatically. In this paper we generalize this idea to the block-based programming language Scratch. We propose a set of 30 different questions for Scratch code covering an established program comprehension model, and extend the LitterBox static analysis tool to automatically generate corresponding questions for a given Scratch program. On a dataset of 600,913 projects we generated 54,118,694 questions automatically. Our initial experiments with 34 ninth graders demonstrate that this approach can indeed generate meaningful questions for Scratch programs, and we find that the ability of students to answer these questions on their programs relates to their overall performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CompEd 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Matthew Effect of AI Programming Assistants: A Hidden Bias in Software Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23261v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-assisted programming is rapidly reshaping software development, with large language models (LLMs) enabling new paradigms such as vibe coding and agentic coding. While prior works have focused on prompt design and code generation quality, the broader impact of LLM-driven development on the iterative dynamics of software engineering remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct large-scale experiments on thousands of algorithmic programming tasks and hundreds of framework selection tasks to systematically investigate how AI-assisted programming interacts with the software ecosystem. Our analysis reveals \textbf{a striking Matthew effect: the more popular a programming language or framework, the higher the success rate of LLM-generated code}. The phenomenon suggests that AI systems may reinforce existing popularity hierarchies, accelerating convergence around dominant tools while hindering diversity and innovation. We provide a quantitative characterization of this effect and discuss its implications for the future evolution of programming ecosystems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Denotational Product Construction for Temporal Verification of Effectful Higher-Order Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11320v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a categorical framework for linear-time temporal verification of effectful higher-order programs, including probabilistic higher-order programs. Our framework provides a generic denotational reduction -- namely, a denotational product construction -- from linear-time safety verification of effectful higher-order programs to computation of weakest pre-conditions of product programs. This reduction enables us to apply existing algorithms for such well-studied computations of weakest pre-conditions, some of which are available as off-the-shelf solvers. We show the correctness of our denotational product construction by proving a preservation theorem under strong monad morphisms and an existence of suitable liftings along a fibration. We instantiate our framework with both probabilistic and angelic nondeterministic higher-order programs, and implement an automated solver for the probabilistic case based on the existing solver developed by Kura and Unno. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automated verifier for linear-time temporal verification of probabilistic higher-order programs with recursion.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[VeriFast's separation logic: a logic without laters for modular verification of fine-grained concurrent programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04500v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>VeriFast is one of the leading tools for semi-automated modular formal program verification. A central feature of VeriFast is its support for higher-order ghost code, which enables its support for expressively specifying fine-grained concurrent modules, without the need for the later modality. We present the first formalization and soundness proof for this aspect of VeriFast's logic, and we compare it both to Iris, a state-of-the-art logic for fine-grained concurrency which features the later modality, as well as to some recent proposals for Iris-like reasoning without the later modality.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[DebugTA: An LLM-Based Agent for Simplifying Debugging and Teaching in Programming Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11076v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In programming education, Debugging and Teaching (DT) task is a common scenario where students receive assistance in correcting their erroneous code. The task involves multiple inputs, including erroneous code, error messages, reference solutions, and the question description, with the goal of generating modification suggestions to the erroneous code. However, two key challenges hinder the effectiveness of existing approaches. Firstly, the complexity and heterogeneity of inputs inherent in DT tasks significantly elevate the reasoning challenges faced by LLMs. Second, existing approaches often fail to fully leverage the availability of standard code in DT tasks, forcing models to rely solely on complex multi-step reasoning, which limits the potential of LLMs in addressing DT tasks effectively. To address these challenges, we propose DebugTA, a novel LLM-based debugging and teaching agent with specialized tools for standard code retrieval, variable substitution to align reference code, and an external compiler for real-time code analysis. Guided by explicit pedagogical and debugging principles, DebugTA acts as an agent that decomposes a complex task into sequential LLM interactions, each utilizing distinct tools for specific subtasks, thereby simplifying the logical reasoning at each step and reducing overall reasoning complexity. Furthermore, DebugTA utilizes tool calls to align the standard code with the erroneous code as much as possible, allowing the LLM to focus on logic errors within the erroneous code and improving the accuracy of the generated suggestions. To rigorously assess the quality of modification suggestions, we introduce a student simulator-teacher interaction paradigm. Experimental results on three real-world code datasets demonstrate that DebugTA consistently improves teaching effectiveness while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Gender Stereotypes in Scratch Programming Tutorials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11064v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gender stereotypes in introductory programming courses often go unnoticed, yet they can negatively influence young learners' interest and learning, particularly under-represented groups such as girls. Popular tutorials on block-based programming with Scratch may unintentionally reinforce biases through character choices, narrative framing, or activity types. Educators currently lack support in identifying and addressing such bias. With large language models~(LLMs) increasingly used to generate teaching materials, this problem is potentially exacerbated by LLMs trained on biased datasets. However, LLMs also offer an opportunity to address this issue. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs for automatically identifying gender-stereotypical elements in Scratch tutorials, thus offering feedback on how to improve teaching content. We develop a framework for assessing gender bias considering characters, content, instructions, and programming concepts. Analogous to how code analysis tools provide feedback on code in terms of code smells, we operationalise this framework using an automated tool chain that identifies *gender stereotype smells*. Evaluation on 73 popular Scratch tutorials from leading educational platforms demonstrates that stereotype smells are common in practice. LLMs are not effective at detecting them, but our gender bias evaluation framework can guide LLMs in generating tutorials with fewer stereotype smells.</p></details> | Koli Calling 2025 |

Generating realistic scenes with varied object poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet scenes.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Learning to Guarantee Type Correctness in Code Generation through Type-Guided Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10216v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models have shown remarkable proficiency in code generation; nevertheless, ensuring type correctness remains a challenge. Although traditional methods, such as constrained decoding, alleviate this problem by externally rejecting untypable code, the model itself does not effectively learn type reasoning internally, which ultimately limits its overall performance. This paper introduces TyFlow, a novel system that internalizes type reasoning within code generation to guide the model to learn the type system. The core of our approach is a novel type-guided program synthesis system that maintains an isomorphism between type derivation trees and synthesis derivation trees, enabling a new code representation based on synthesis decision sequences rather than traditional text-based token sequences. By offloading the complexity of type system learning to the representation itself, models can redirect their computational resources toward higher-level program semantics. Our evaluation shows that TyFlow not only eliminates type errors but also significantly improves functional correctness, highlighting the importance of aligning LMs with type systems internally.</p></details> |  |
| **[End-to-end Compositional Verification of Program Safety through Verified and Verifying Compilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10015v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program safety (i.e., absence of undefined behaviors) is critical for correct operation of computer systems. It is usually verified at the source level (e.g., by separation logics) and preserved to the target by verified compilers (e.g., CompCert), thereby achieving end-to-end verification of safety. However, modern safe programming languages like Rust pose new problems in achieving end-to-end safety. Because not all functionalities can be implemented in the safe language, mixing safe and unsafe modules is needed. Therefore, verified compilation must preserve a modular notion of safety which can be composed at the target level. Furthermore, certain classes of errors (e.g., memory errors) are automatically excluded by verifying compilation (e.g., borrow checking) for modules written in safe languages. As a result, verified compilation needs to cooperate with verifying compilation to ensure end-to-end safety. To address the above problems, we propose a modular and generic definition of safety called open safety based on program semantics described as open labeled transition systems (LTS). Open safety is composable at the boundary of modules and can be modularly preserved by verified compositional compilation. Those properties enable separate verification of safety for heterogeneous modules and composition of the safety results at the target level. Open safety can be generalized to partial safety (i.e., only a certain class of errors can occur). By this we formalized the correctness of verifying compilation as derivation of total safety from partial safety. We demonstrate how our framework can combine verified and verifying compilation by developing a verified compiler for an ownership language (called Owlang) inspired by Rust. We evaluate our approach on the compositional safety verification using a hash map implemented by Owlang and C.</p></details> |  |
| **[Remote Interference Mitigation through Null Precoding and Fractional Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09989v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid deployment of 5G systems, remote interference (RI) caused by atmospheric ducting has emerged as an occasional, but critical challenge. This phenomenon occurs when the downlink (DL) signals from distant base stations (BSs) propagate over long distances through tropospheric ducting, severely disrupting uplink (UL) reception at local BSs. To address this challenge, we analyze the effect of RI on network performance, including the channel estimation phase. We then develop a solution that identifies the angle-of-arrival (AOA) estimation of RI and designs precoders and combiners that mitigate RI. Our approach employs interference cancellation techniques through null precoding and fractional programming which enhance the performance of the network. Interestingly, we show that using our scheme, uplink communication is possible at low transmit power regimes that were unusable due to RI. Our results further show a 5.23~dB reduction in normalized mean square error for channel estimation and achieved data rates around 5.8~bit/s/Hz at the previously unusable low uplink transmit power conditions.</p></details> |  |

Inspired by this vision, this paper introduces dependent type theory (of which Martin-L\"of type theory is an example) to a statistical audience. Examples from statistics and probability theory demonstrate how dependent type theory and an algebraic perspective can unify the theoretical and computational concerns of statistics, ensuring rigorous, machine-checked proofs and executable software.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multilingual Python Programming Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09591v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>All widely used and useful programming languages have a common problem. They restrict entry on the basis of knowledge of the English language. The lack of knowledge of English poses a major hurdle to many newcomers who do not have the resources, in terms of time and money, to learn the English language. Studies show that people learn better in their own language. Therefore, we propose a language transpiler built on top of the Python programming language, called UniversalPython, which allows one to write Python in their own human language. We demonstrate the ability to create an "Urdu Python" with this transpiler. In the future, we aim to scale the language to encapsulate more human languages to increase the availability of programming. The source code for this transpiler is open-source, and available at https://github.com/universalpython/universalpython</p></details> | <details><summary>For p...</summary><p>For project homepage, see https://universalpython.github.io/</p></details> |
| **[Enabling Population-Level Parallelism in Tree-Based Genetic Programming for GPU Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17168v5)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tree-based Genetic Programming (TGP) is a widely used evolutionary algorithm for tasks such as symbolic regression, classification, and robotic control. Due to the intensive computational demands of running TGP, GPU acceleration is crucial for achieving scalable performance. However, efficient GPU-based execution of TGP remains challenging, primarily due to three core issues: (1) the structural heterogeneity of program individuals, (2) the complexity of integrating multiple levels of parallelism, and (3) the incompatibility between high-performance CUDA execution and flexible Python-based environments. To address these issues, we propose EvoGP, a high-performance framework tailored for GPU acceleration of TGP via population-level parallel execution. First, EvoGP introduces a tensorized representation that encodes variable-sized trees into fixed-shape, memory-aligned arrays, enabling uniform memory access and parallel computation across diverse individuals. Second, EvoGP adopts an adaptive parallelism strategy that dynamically combines intra- and inter-individual parallelism based on dataset size, ensuring high GPU utilization across a broad spectrum of tasks. Third, EvoGP embeds custom CUDA kernels into the PyTorch runtime, achieving seamless integration with Python-based environments such as Gym, MuJoCo, Brax, and Genesis. Experiments show that EvoGP attains a peak throughput exceeding $10^{11}$ GPops/s, with speedups of up to $528\times$ over GPU-based TGP implementations and $18\times$ over the fastest CPU-based libraries, while maintaining comparable accuracy and improved scalability across large population sizes. EvoGP is open source and accessible at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/evogp.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequence Variables: A Constraint Programming Computational Domain for Routing and Sequencing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09373v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constraint Programming (CP) offers an intuitive, declarative framework for modeling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), yet classical CP models based on successor variables cannot always deal with optional visits or insertion based heuristics. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes sequence variables within CP. Unlike the classical successor models, this computational domain handle optional visits and support insertion heuristics, including insertion-based Large Neighborhood Search. We provide a clear definition of their domain, update operations, and introduce consistency levels for constraints on this domain. An implementation is described with the underlying data structures required for integrating sequence variables into existing trail-based CP solvers. Furthermore, global constraints specifically designed for sequence variables and vehicle routing are introduced. Finally, the effectiveness of sequence variables is demonstrated by simplifying problem modeling and achieving competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride Problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Herb.jl: A Unifying Program Synthesis Library](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09726v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program synthesis -- the automatic generation of code given a specification -- is one of the most fundamental tasks in artificial intelligence (AI) and many programmers' dream. Numerous synthesizers have been developed to tackle program synthesis, manifesting different ideas to approach the exponentially growing program space. While numerous smart program synthesis tools exist, reusing and remixing previously developed methods is tedious and time-consuming. We propose Herb.jl, a unifying program synthesis library written in the Julia programming language, to address these issues. Since current methods rely on similar building blocks, we aim to modularize the underlying synthesis algorithm into communicating and fully extendable sub-compartments, allowing for straightforward reapplication of these modules. To demonstrate the benefits of using Herb.jl, we show three common use cases: 1. how to implement a simple problem and grammar, and how to solve it, 2. how to implement a previously developed synthesizer with just a few lines of code, and 3. how to run a synthesizer against a benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Obfuscation of Unitary Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11970v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program obfuscation aims to hide the inner workings of a program while preserving its functionality. In the quantum setting, recent works have obtained obfuscation schemes for specialized classes of quantum circuits. For instance, Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2024) constructed a quantum state obfuscation scheme, which supports the obfuscation of quantum programs represented as quantum states for pseudo-deterministic quantum programs with classical inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model. In this work, we improve upon existing results by constructing the first quantum state obfuscation scheme for unitary (or approximately unitary) quantum programs supporting quantum inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model. At the core of our obfuscation scheme are two novel ingredients: a functional quantum authentication scheme that allows key holders to learn specific functions of the authenticated quantum state with simulation-based security, and a compiler that represents an arbitrary quantum circuit as a projective linear-plus-measurement quantum program described by a sequence of non-adaptive Clifford gates interleaved with adaptive and compatible measurements.</p></details> |  |

The position of the MP is updated via the API in an automated manner over a set of samples within a shell enclosing the surface of the CFS. For each pose of the manipulator, each pair of legs is investigated for mutual collisions. The CFS is considered safe or validated iff none of the points falling inside the CFS lead to a collision between any pair of legs. This approach can not only validate the safety of a precomputed CFS, but also estimate the same for any spatial parallel manipulator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Sparsification for Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08348v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a generic framework for solving linear programs (LPs) with many constraints $(n \gg d)$ via adaptive sparsification. Our approach provides a principled generalization of the techniques of [Assadi '23] from matching problems to general LPs and robustifies [Clarkson's '95] celebrated algorithm for the exact setting. The framework reduces LP solving to a sequence of calls to a ``low-violation oracle'' on small, adaptively sampled subproblems, which we analyze through the lens of the multiplicative weight update method. Our main results demonstrate the versatility of this paradigm. First, we present a quantum version of Clarkson's algorithm that finds an exact solution to an LP using $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n} d^3)$ row-queries to the constraint matrix. This is achieved by accelerating the classical bottleneck (the search for violated constraints) with a generalization of Grover search, decoupling the quantum component from the classical solver. Second, our framework yields new state-of-the-art algorithms for mixed packing and covering problems when the packing constraints are ``simple''. By retaining all packing constraints while sampling only from the covering constraints, we achieve a significant width reduction, leading to faster solvers in both the classical and quantum query models. Our work provides a modular and powerful approach for accelerating LP solvers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concept-Based Generic Programming in C++](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08969v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present programming techniques to illustrate the facilities and principles of C++ generic programming using concepts. Concepts are C++'s way to express constraints on generic code. As an initial example, we provide a simple type system that eliminates narrowing conversions and provides range checking without unnecessary notational or run-time overheads. Concepts are used throughout to provide user-defined extensions to the type system. The aim is to show their utility and the fundamental ideas behind them, rather than to provide a detailed or complete explanation of C++'s language support for generic programming or the extensive support provided by the standard library. Generic programming is an integral part of C++, rather than an isolated sub-language. In particular, key facilities support general programming as well as generic programming (e.g., uniform notation for types, lambdas, variadic templates, and C++26 static reflection). Finally, we give design rationales and origins for key parts of the concept design, including use patterns, the relationship to Object-Oriented Programming, value arguments, notation, concept type-matching, and definition checking.</p></details> |  |
| **[PDCS: A Primal-Dual Large-Scale Conic Programming Solver with GPU Enhancements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00311v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the Primal-Dual Conic Programming Solver (PDCS), a large-scale conic programming solver with GPU enhancements. Problems that PDCS currently supports include linear programs, second-order cone programs, convex quadratic programs, and exponential cone programs. PDCS achieves scalability to large-scale problems by leveraging sparse matrix-vector multiplication as its core computational operation, which is both memory-efficient and well-suited for GPU acceleration. The solver is based on the restarted primal-dual hybrid gradient method but further incorporates several enhancements, including adaptive reflected Halpern restarts, adaptive step-size selection, adaptive weight adjustment, and diagonal rescaling. Additionally, PDCS employs a bijection-based method to compute projections onto rescaled cones. Furthermore, cuPDCS is a GPU implementation of PDCS and it implements customized computational schemes that utilize different levels of GPU architecture to handle cones of different types and sizes. Numerical experiments demonstrate that cuPDCS is generally more efficient than state-of-the-art commercial solvers and other first-order methods on large-scale conic program applications, including Fisher market equilibrium problems, Lasso regression, and multi-period portfolio optimization. Furthermore, cuPDCS also exhibits better scalability, efficiency, and robustness compared to other first-order methods on the conic program benchmark dataset CBLIB. These advantages are more pronounced in large-scale, lower-accuracy settings.</p></details> | 48 pages, 8 figures |

According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trustworthy AI. In this context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP), Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming(CP).Our contributions include the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling with the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental study that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw some perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model into a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.</p></details> |  |

While its semantics (possibilistic stable models) and properties have been well investigated, the problem of inductive reasoning has not been investigated yet. This paper presents an approach to extracting poss-programs from a background program and examples (parts of intended possibilistic stable models). To this end, the notion of induction tasks is first formally defined, its properties are investigated and two algorithms ilpsm and ilpsmmin for computing induction solutions are presented. An implementation of ilpsmmin is also provided and experimental results show that when inputs are ordinary logic programs, the prototype outperforms a major inductive learning system for normal logic programs from stable models on the datasets that are randomly generated.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)</p></details> |
| **[A Duality Theorem for Classical-Quantum States with Applications to Complete Relational Program Logics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07051v1)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Duality theorems play a fundamental role in convex optimization. Recently, it was shown how duality theorems for countable probability distributions and finite-dimensional quantum states can be leveraged for building relatively complete relational program logics for probabilistic and quantum programs, respectively. However, complete relational logics for classical-quantum programs, which combine classical and quantum computations and operate over classical as well as quantum variables, have remained out of reach. The main gap is that while prior duality theorems could readily be derived using optimal transport and semidefinite programming methods, respectively, the combined setting falls out of the scope of these methods and requires new ideas. In this paper, we overcome this gap and establish the desired duality theorem for classical-quantum states. Our argument relies critically on a novel dimension-independent analysis of the convex optimization problem underlying the finite-dimensional quantum setting, which, in particular, allows us to take the limit where the classical state space becomes infinite. Using the resulting duality theorem, we establish soundness and completeness of a new relational program logic, called $\mathsf{cqOTL}$, for classical-quantum programs. In addition, we lift prior restrictions on the completeness of two existing program logics: $\mathsf{eRHL}$ for probabilistic programs (Avanzini et al., POPL 2025) and $\mathsf{qOTL}$ for quantum programs (Barthe et al., LICS 2025).</p></details> | <details><summary>63 pa...</summary><p>63 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Toward Causal-Visual Programming: Enhancing Agentic Reasoning in Low-Code Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25282v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 table |
| **[Automated Program Repair of Uncompilable Student Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06187v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A significant portion of student programming submissions in CS1 learning environments are uncompilable, limiting their use in student modeling and downstream knowledge tracing. Traditional modeling pipelines often exclude these cases, discarding observations of student learning. This study investigates automated program repair as a strategy to recover uncompilable code while preserving students' structural intent for use in student modeling. Within this framework, we assess large language models (LLMs) as repair agents, including GPT-5 (OpenAI), Claude 3.5 Haiku (Anthropic), and Gemini 2.5 Flash (Google), under high- and low-context prompting conditions. Repairs were evaluated for compilability, edit distance, and preservation of students' original structure and logic. We find that while all three LLMs are capable of producing compilable repairs, their behavior diverges in how well they preserve students' control flow and code structure, which affects their pedagogical utility. By recovering uncompilable submissions, this work enables richer and more comprehensive analyses of learners' coding processes and development over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[ConstraintLLM: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Industrial-Level Constraint Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05774v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constraint programming (CP) is a crucial technology for solving real-world constraint optimization problems (COPs), with the advantages of rich modeling semantics and high solving efficiency. Using large language models (LLMs) to generate formal modeling automatically for COPs is becoming a promising approach, which aims to build trustworthy neuro-symbolic AI with the help of symbolic solvers. However, CP has received less attention compared to works based on operations research (OR) models. We introduce ConstraintLLM, the first LLM specifically designed for CP modeling, which is trained on an open-source LLM with multi-instruction supervised fine-tuning. We propose the Constraint-Aware Retrieval Module (CARM) to increase the in-context learning capabilities, which is integrated in a Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) framework with guided self-correction mechanism. Moreover, we construct and release IndusCP, the first industrial-level benchmark for CP modeling, which contains 140 challenging tasks from various domains. Our experiments demonstrate that ConstraintLLM achieves state-of-the-art solving accuracy across multiple benchmarks and outperforms the baselines by 2x on the new IndusCP benchmark.

| **[PLSemanticsBench: Large Language Models As Programming Language Interpreters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03415v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) excel at code reasoning, a natural question arises: can an LLM execute programs (i.e., act as an interpreter) purely based on a programming language's formal semantics? If so, it will enable rapid prototyping of new programming languages and language features. We study this question using the imperative language IMP (a subset of C), formalized via small-step operational semantics (SOS) and rewriting-based operational semantics (K-semantics). We introduce three evaluation sets-Human-Written, LLM-Translated, and Fuzzer- Generated-whose difficulty is controlled by code-complexity metrics spanning the size, control-flow, and data-flow axes. Given a program and its semantics formalized with SOS/K-semantics, models are evaluated on three tasks ranging from coarse to fine: (1) final-state prediction, (2) semantic rule prediction, and (3) execution trace prediction. To distinguish pretraining memorization from semantic competence, we define two nonstandard semantics obtained through systematic mutations of the standard rules. Across strong code/reasoning LLMs, performance drops under nonstandard semantics despite high performance under the standard one. We further find that (i) there are patterns to different model failures, (ii) most reasoning models perform exceptionally well on coarse grained tasks involving reasoning about highly complex programs often containing nested loop depths beyond five, and surprisingly, (iii) providing formal semantics helps on simple programs but often hurts on more complex ones. Overall, the results show a promise that LLMs could serve as programming language interpreters, but points to the lack of their robust semantics understanding. We release the benchmark and the supporting code at https://github.com/EngineeringSoftware/PLSemanticsBench.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing explorations focus on GenAI tools that primarily support text-to-text interaction. With recent developments, GenAI applications have begun supporting multiple modes of communication, known as multimodality. In this work, we explored how undergraduate programming novices choose and work with multimodal GenAI tools, and their criteria for choices. We selected a commercially available multimodal GenAI platform for interaction, as it supports multiple input and output modalities, including text, audio, image upload, and real-time screen-sharing. Through 16 think-aloud sessions that combined participant observation with follow-up semi-structured interviews, we investigated student modality choices for GenAI tools when completing programming problems and the underlying criteria for modality selections. With multimodal communication emerging as the future of AI in education, this work aims to spark continued exploration on understanding student interaction with multimodal GenAI in the context of CS education.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, accepted to SIGCSE2026</p></details> |
| **[Modeling Student Learning with 3.8 Million Program Traces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05056v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As programmers write code, they often edit and retry multiple times, creating rich "interaction traces" that reveal how they approach coding tasks and provide clues about their level of skill development. For novice programmers in particular, these traces reflect the diverse reasoning processes they employ to code, such as exploratory behavior to understand how a programming concept works, re-strategizing in response to bugs, and personalizing stylistic choices. In this work, we explore what can be learned from training language models on such reasoning traces: not just about code, but about coders, and particularly students learning to program. We introduce a dataset of over 3.8 million programming reasoning traces from users of Pencil Code, a free online educational platform used by students to learn simple programming concepts. Compared to models trained only on final programs or synthetically-generated traces, we find that models trained on real traces are stronger at modeling diverse student behavior. Through both behavioral and probing analyses, we also find that many properties of code traces, such as goal backtracking or number of comments, can be predicted from learned representations of the students who write them. Building on this result, we show that we can help students recover from mistakes by steering code generation models to identify a sequence of edits that will results in more correct code while remaining close to the original student's style. Together, our results suggest that many properties of code are properties of individual students and that training on edit traces can lead to models that are more steerable, more predictive of student behavior while programming, and better at generating programs in their final states.

The multi-stage aspect captures the different times at which variable renewable generation and electricity prices are observed.

| **[Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v4)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16x on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |

However, it is unclear how well these models perform on tasks that require a combination of these skills. In this paper, we curate a novel program synthesis benchmark based on the real-world tasks in the XLogoOnline visual programming environment. Each task requires a combination of different skills such as spatial planning, basic programming, and logical reasoning. Our evaluation shows that current state-of-the-art models like GPT-4V and Llama3-70B struggle to solve these tasks, achieving only 20% and 2.35% success rates, respectively. Next, we develop a fine-tuning pipeline to boost the performance of models by leveraging a large-scale synthetic training dataset with over 80,000 tasks. Moreover, we showcase how emulator-driven feedback can be used to design a curriculum over training data distribution, through which a fine-tuned Llama3-8B drastically outperforms GPT-4V and Llama3-70B models. Finally, we provide an in-depth failure analysis to understand the limitations of different models. We will publicly release the benchmark for future research on program synthesis in visual programming.</p></details> | ACL'25 paper |
| **[Optimization under uncertainty: understanding orders and testing programs with specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18561v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the most ubiquitous problems in optimization is that of finding all the elements of a finite set at which a function $f$ attains its minimum (or maximum). When the codomain of $f$ is equipped with a total order, it is easy to specify, implement, and verify generic solutions to this problem. But what if $f$ is affected by uncertainties? What if one seeks values that minimize more than one objective, or if $f$ does not return a single result but a set of possible results, or even a probability distribution? Such situations are common in climate science, economics, and engineering. Developing trustworthy solution methods for optimization under uncertainty requires formulating and answering these questions rigorously, including deciding which order relations to apply in different cases. We show how functional programming can support this task, and apply it to specify and test solution methods for cases where optimization is affected by two conceptually different kinds of uncertainty: value and functorial uncertainty.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inverse Mixed-Integer Programming: Learning Constraints then Objective Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04455v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mixed-integer linear programming, data-driven inverse optimization that learns the objective function and the constraints from observed data plays an important role in constructing appropriate mathematical models for various fields, including power systems and scheduling. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no known method for learning both the objective functions and the constraints. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method for a class of problems where the objective function is expressed as a linear combination of functions and the constraints are represented by functions and thresholds. Specifically, our method first learns the constraints and then learns the objective function. On the theoretical side, we show the proposed method can solve inverse optimization problems in finite dataset, develop statistical learning theory in pseudometric spaces and sub-Gaussian distributions, and construct a statistical learning for inverse optimization. On the experimental side, we demonstrate that our method is practically applicable for scheduling problems formulated as integer linear programmings with up to 100 decision variables, which are typical in real-world settings.</p></details> | 33 pages |

Influence branching, a new graph-oriented variable selection strategy, is applied throughout the first iterations of the branch and bound algorithm. This branching heuristic is optimized online with Thompson sampling, which ranks the best graph representations of MIP's structure according to computational speed up over SCIP. We achieve results comparable to state of the art online learning methods. Moreover, our results indicate that our method generalizes well to more general online frameworks, where variations in constraint matrix, constraint vector and objective coefficients can all occur and where more samples are available.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[A Conformal Prediction-Based Chance-Constrained Programming Approach for 24/7 Carbon-Free Data Center Operation Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04053v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of AI applications is dramatically increasing data center energy demand, exacerbating carbon emissions, and necessitating a shift towards 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE). Unlike traditional annual energy matching, 24/7 CFE requires matching real-time electricity consumption with clean energy generation every hour, presenting significant challenges due to the inherent variability and forecasting errors of renewable energy sources. Traditional robust and data-driven optimization methods often fail to leverage the features of the prediction model (also known as contextual or covariate information) when constructing the uncertainty set, leading to overly conservative operational decisions. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach for 24/7 CFE data center operation scheduling, focusing on robust decision-making under renewable generation uncertainty. This framework leverages covariate information through a multi-variable conformal prediction (CP) technique to construct statistically valid and adaptive uncertainty sets for renewable forecasts. The uncertainty sets directly inform the chance-constrained programming (CCP) problem, ensuring that chance constraints are met with a specified probability. We further establish theoretical underpinnings connecting the CP-generated uncertainty sets to the statistical feasibility guarantees of the CCP. Numerical results highlight the benefits of this covariate-aware approach, demonstrating up to 6.65% cost reduction and 6.96% decrease in carbon-based energy usage compared to conventional covariate-independent methods, thereby enabling data centers to progress toward 24/7 CEF.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dynamic Programming Approach to Evader Pathfinding in Static Pursuit Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04050v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interdiction of escaping adversaries in urban networks is a critical security challenge. State-of-the-art game-theoretic models, such as the Escape Interdiction Game (EIG), provide comprehensive frameworks but assume a highly dynamic interaction and entail significant computational complexity, which can be prohibitive for real-time applications. This paper investigates a crucial sub-problem: an evader's optimal pathfinding calculus when faced with a static or pre-determined defender deployment. We propose the Dynamic Programming for Evader Route Optimization (DPERO) algorithm, which models the environment as a graph with probabilistic risks at various nodes. By transforming the multiplicative survival objective into an additive cost function using logarithms, we frame the task as a shortest path problem solvable with value iteration. This approach allows for the efficient computation of a path that optimally balances safety and distance. Experimental results on simulated grid networks demonstrate that DPERO identifies routes with significantly higher survival probabilities compared to naive shortest-path baselines, validating its efficacy as a practical tool for vulnerability analysis and strategic planning.</p></details> |  |

An analysis of fifty-eight peer-reviewed studies published between 2022 and 2025 identified three primary categories of AI agents: chatbots, generative AI (GenAI), and intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), with GenAI being the most frequently studied. The primary instructional objectives reported include enhanced programming support in 94.83% of studies, motivational and emotional benefits in 18.96%, and increased efficiency for educators in 6.90%. Reported benefits include personalized feedback, improved learning outcomes, and time savings. The review also highlights challenges, such as setup barriers documented in 93.10% of studies, overreliance resulting in superficial learning in 65.52%, and concerns regarding AI errors and academic integrity. These findings suggest the need for instructional frameworks that prioritize the development of prompt engineering skills and human oversight to address these issues. This review provides educators and curriculum designers with an evidence-based foundation for the practical and ethical integration of AI in programming education.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) present opportunities to scale such support, though their effectiveness depends on how well technical capabilities are aligned with pedagogical goals. This survey synthesizes recent work on LLM applications in programming education across three focal areas: formative code feedback, assessment, and knowledge modeling. We identify recurring design patterns in how these tools are applied and find that interventions are most effective when educator expertise complements model output through human-in-the-loop oversight, scaffolding, and evaluation. Fully automated approaches are often constrained in capturing the pedagogical nuances of programming education, although human-in-the-loop designs and course specific adaptation offer promising directions for future improvement. Future research should focus on improving transparency, strengthening alignment with pedagogy, and developing systems that flexibly adapt to the needs of varied learning contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 EMNLP HCI+NLP Workshop Short Paper</p></details> |

It highlights the critical role of feature selection and, at the same time, shows that the signal feature set can be slightly overestimated without compromising clustering performance. Guided by this theory, our method alternates between rough feature selection and clustering: feature selection is performed by thresholding a rough estimate of the discriminative direction, while clustering is carried out via an SDP-relaxed $K$-means. We further extend the method to settings with unknown sparse precision matrices, avoiding full model parameter estimation by computing only the minimally required quantities.</p></details> | <details><summary>123 p...</summary><p>123 pages, 5 figures, 12 tables, 6 algorithms; Main text 24 pages, 2 figures, 2 table, 3 algorithms</p></details> |
| **[LLM-Guided Evolutionary Program Synthesis for Quasi-Monte Carlo Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03650v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-discrepancy point sets and digital sequences underpin quasi-Monte Carlo (QMC) methods for high-dimensional integration. We cast two long-standing QMC design problems as program synthesis and solve them with an LLM-guided evolutionary loop that mutates and selects code under task-specific fitness: (i) constructing finite 2D/3D point sets with low star discrepancy, and (ii) choosing Sobol' direction numbers that minimize randomized QMC error on downstream integrands. Our two-phase procedure combines constructive code proposals with iterative numerical refinement. On finite sets, we rediscover known optima in small 2D cases and set new best-known 2D benchmarks for N >= 40, while matching most known 3D optima up to the proven frontier (N <= 8) and reporting improved 3D benchmarks beyond. On digital sequences, evolving Sobol' parameters yields consistent reductions in randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (rQMC) mean-squared error for several 32-dimensional option-pricing tasks relative to widely used Joe--Kuo parameters, while preserving extensibility to any sample size and compatibility with standard randomizations. Taken together, the results demonstrate that LLM-driven evolutionary program synthesis can automate the discovery of high-quality QMC constructions, recovering classical designs where they are optimal and improving them where finite-N structure matters.

| **[REFINE: Enhancing Program Repair Agents through Context-Aware Patch Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03588v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong potential in automatic program repair (APR), especially in repository-level settings where the goal is to generate patches based on natural language issue descriptions, large codebases, and regression tests. However, despite their promise, current LLM-based APR techniques often struggle to produce correct fixes due to limited understanding of code context and over-reliance on incomplete test suites. As a result, they frequently generate Draft Patches-partially correct patches that either incompletely address the bug or overfit to the test cases. In this work, we propose a novel patch refinement framework, Refine, that systematically transforms Draft Patches into correct ones. Refine addresses three key challenges: disambiguating vague issue and code context, diversifying patch candidates through test-time scaling, and aggregating partial fixes via an LLM-powered code review process. We implement Refine as a general refinement module that can be integrated into both open-agent-based and workflow-based APR systems. Our evaluation on the SWE-Bench Lite benchmark shows that Refine achieves state-of-the-art results among workflow-based approaches and approaches the best-known performance across all APR categories. Specifically, Refine boosts AutoCodeRover's performance by 14.67%, achieving a score of 51.67% and surpassing all prior baselines. On SWE-Bench Verified, Refine improves the resolution rate by 12.2%, and when integrated across multiple APR systems, it yields an average improvement of 14%-demonstrating its broad effectiveness and generalizability. These results highlight the effectiveness of refinement as a missing component in current APR pipelines and the potential of agentic collaboration in closing the gap between near-correct and correct patches.

Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models and formal verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, Lean code provided</p></details> |
| **[A Sequential Quadratic Programming Perspective on Optimal Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03475v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper offers a unified perspective on different approaches to the solution of optimal control problems through the lens of constrained sequential quadratic programming. In particular, it allows us to find the relationships between Newton's method, the iterative LQR (iLQR), and Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) approaches to solve the problem. It is shown that the iLQR is a principled SQP approach, rather than simply an approximation of DDP by neglecting the Hessian terms, to solve optimal control problems that can be guaranteed to always produce a cost-descent direction and converge to an optimum; while Newton's approach or DDP do not have similar guarantees, especially far from an optimum. Our empirical evaluations on the pendulum and cart-pole swing-up tasks serve to corroborate the SQP-based analysis proposed in this paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[Abstain and Validate: A Dual-LLM Policy for Reducing Noise in Agentic Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03217v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic Automated Program Repair (APR) is increasingly tackling complex, repository-level bugs in industry, but ultimately agent-generated patches still need to be reviewed by a human before committing them to ensure they address the bug. Showing unlikely patches to developers can lead to substantial noise, wasting valuable developer time and eroding trust in automated code changes. We introduce two complementary LLM-based policies to reduce such noise: bug abstention and patch validation policies. Bug abstention excludes bugs that the agentic APR system is unlikely to fix. Patch validation rejects patches that are unlikely to be a good fix for the given bug. We evaluate both policies on three sets of bugs from Google's codebase, and their candidate patches generated by an internal agentic APR system. On a set of 174 human-reported bugs, removing bugs and patch trajectories rejected by our policies can raise success rates by up to 13 percentage points and 15 percentage points, respectively, and by up to 39 percentage points in combination. On null pointer exceptions and sanitizer-reported bugs with machine-generated bug reports, patch validation also improves average single-sample success rates. This two-policy approach provides a practical path to the reliable, industrial-scale deployment of agentic APR systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Knowledge Injection for Improving LLM-based Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24015v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting LLMs with bug-related context (e.g., error messages, stack traces) improves automated program repair, but many bugs still remain unresolved. In real-world projects, developers often rely on broader repository and project-level context beyond the local code to resolve such bugs. In this paper, we investigate how automatically extracting and providing such knowledge can improve LLM-based program repair. We propose a layered knowledge injection framework that incrementally augments LLMs with structured context. It starts with the Bug Knowledge Layer, which includes information such as the buggy function and failing tests; expands to the Repository Knowledge Layer, which adds structural dependencies, related files, and commit history; and finally injects the Project Knowledge Layer, which incorporates relevant details from documentation and previously fixed bugs. We evaluate this framework on a dataset of 314 bugs from BugsInPy using two LLMs (Llama 3.3 and GPT-4o-mini), and analyze fix rates across six bug types. By progressively injecting knowledge across layers, our approach achieves a fix rate of 79% (250/314) using Llama 3.3, a significant improvement of 23% over previous work. All bug types show improvement with the addition of repository-level context, while only a subset benefit further from project-level knowledge, highlighting that different bug types require different levels of contextual information for effective repair. We also analyze the remaining unresolved bugs and find that more complex and structurally isolated bugs, such as Program Anomaly and GUI bugs, remain difficult even after injecting all available information. Our results show that layered context injection improves program repair and suggest the need for interactive and adaptive APR systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/ACM Automated Software Engineering (ASE) 2025 Conference</p></details> |

Previous highly visible studies have established associations between certain programming languages and energy consumption. A causal misinterpretation of this work has led academics and industry leaders to use or support certain languages based on their claimed impact on energy consumption. This paper tackles this causal question directly: it develops a detailed causal model capturing the complex relationship between programming language choice and energy consumption. This model identifies and incorporates several critical but previously overlooked factors that affect energy usage. These factors, such as distinguishing programming languages from their implementations, the impact of the application implementations themselves, the number of active cores, and memory activity, can significantly skew energy consumption measurements if not accounted for. We show -- via empirical experiments, improved methodology, and careful examination of anomalies -- that when these factors are controlled for, notable discrepancies in prior work vanish. Our analysis suggests that the choice of programming language implementation has no significant impact on energy consumption beyond execution time.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, to appear at ASE'25</p></details> |
| **[Smart Contract Intent Detection with Pre-trained Programming Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20086v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malicious developer intents in smart contracts constitute significant security threats to decentralized applications, leading to substantial economic losses. To address this, SmartIntentNN was previously introduced as a deep learning model for detecting unsafe developer intents. By combining the Universal Sentence Encoder, a K-means clustering-based intent highlighting mechanism, and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network, the model achieved an F1 score of 0.8633 on an evaluation set of 10,000 real-world smart contracts across ten distinct intent categories. In this study, we present an enhanced version of this model, SmartIntentNN2 (Smart Contract Intent Neural Network V2). The primary enhancement is the integration of a BERT-based pre-trained programming language model, which we domain-adaptively pre-train on a dataset of 16,000 real-world smart contracts using a Masked Language Modeling objective. SmartIntentNN2 retains the BiLSTM-based multi-label classification network for intent detection. On the same evaluation set of 10,000 smart contracts, SmartIntentNN2 achieves superior performance with an accuracy of 0.9789, precision of 0.9090, recall of 0.9476, and an F1 score of 0.9279, substantially outperforming its predecessor and other baseline models. Notably, SmartIntentNN2 also delivers a 65.5% relative improvement in F1 score over GPT-4.1 on this specialized task. These results establish SmartIntentNN2 as a new state-of-the-art model for smart contract intent detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |

Our approach leverages the doubly nonnegative (DNN) relaxation to compute strong lower bounds and generate separating cuts, which are iteratively added to improve the relaxation. We establish that, at any Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point satisfying a second-order sufficient condition, a valid cut can be obtained by solving a linear semidefinite program (SDP), and we devise a finite-termination local search procedure to identify such points. Extensive computational experiments on both benchmark and synthetic instances demonstrate that our approach yields tighter bounds and consistently outperforms leading commercial and academic solvers in terms of efficiency, robustness, and scalability. Notably, on a standard desktop, our algorithm reduces the relative optimality gap to 0.01% on 138 out of 140 instances of dimension 100 within one hour, without resorting to branch-and-bound.</p></details> |  |
| **[New Limits on Distributed Quantum Advantage: Dequantizing Linear Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07574v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we give two results that put new limits on distributed quantum advantage in the context of the LOCAL model of distributed computing. First, we show that there is no distributed quantum advantage for any linear program. Put otherwise, if there is a quantum-LOCAL algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ that finds an $\alpha$-approximation of some linear optimization problem $\Pi$ in $T$ communication rounds, we can construct a classical, deterministic LOCAL algorithm $\mathcal{A}'$ that finds an $\alpha$-approximation of $\Pi$ in $T$ rounds. As a corollary, all classical lower bounds for linear programs, including the KMW bound, hold verbatim in quantum-LOCAL. Second, using the above result, we show that there exists a locally checkable labeling problem (LCL) for which quantum-LOCAL is strictly weaker than the classical deterministic SLOCAL model. Our results extend from quantum-LOCAL also to finitely dependent and non-signaling distributions, and one of the corollaries of our work is that the non-signaling model and the SLOCAL model are incomparable in the context of LCL problems: By prior work, there exists an LCL problem for which SLOCAL is strictly weaker than the non-signaling model, and our work provides a separation in the opposite direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DISC 2025</p></details> |

We present the first empirical study of vibe coding. We analysed over 8 hours of curated video capturing extended vibe coding sessions with rich think-aloud reflections. Using framework analysis, we investigated programmers' goals, workflows, prompting techniques, debugging approaches, and challenges encountered. We find that vibe coding follows iterative goal satisfaction cycles where developers alternate between prompting AI, evaluating generated code through rapid scanning and application testing, and manual editing. Prompts in vibe coding blend vague, high-level directives with detailed technical specifications. Debugging remains a hybrid process combining AI assistance with manual practices. Critically, vibe coding does not eliminate the need for programming expertise but rather redistributes it toward context management, rapid code evaluation, and decisions about when to transition between AI-driven and manual manipulation of code. Trust in AI tools during vibe coding is dynamic and contextual, developed through iterative verification rather than blanket acceptance. Vibe coding is an evolution of AI-assisted programming that represents an early manifestation of "material disengagement", wherein practitioners orchestrate code production and manipulation, mediated through AI, while maintaining selective and strategic oversight.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sarka...</summary><p>Sarkar, A., & Drosos, I.

Despite its widespread adoption, critical security bugs in OpenID Connect have resulted in significant financial losses and security breaches, highlighting the need for robust mitigation strategies. Automated program repair presents a promising solution for generating candidate patches for OpenID implementations. However, challenges such as domain-specific complexities and the necessity for precise fault localization and patch verification must be addressed. We propose AuthFix, a counterexample-guided repair engine leveraging LLMs for automated OpenID bug fixing. AuthFix integrates three key components: fault localization, patch synthesis, and patch verification. By employing a novel Petri-net-based model checker, AuthFix ensures the correctness of patches by effectively modeling interactions. Our evaluation on a dataset of OpenID bugs demonstrates that AuthFix successfully generated correct patches for 17 out of 23 bugs (74%), with a high proportion of patches semantically equivalent to developer-written fixes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version.

Yet, in dynamic and large-scale scenarios, the most effective heuristics are often highly complex, hindering interpretability, slowing convergence, and limiting transferability across tasks. To address these challenges, we present EvoSpeak, a novel framework that integrates GP with large language models (LLMs) to enhance the efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of heuristic evolution. EvoSpeak learns from high-quality GP heuristics, extracts knowledge, and leverages this knowledge to (i) generate warm-start populations that accelerate convergence, (ii) translate opaque GP trees into concise natural-language explanations that foster interpretability and trust, and (iii) enable knowledge transfer and preference-aware heuristic generation across related tasks. We verify the effectiveness of EvoSpeak through extensive experiments on dynamic flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS), under both single- and multi-objective formulations. The results demonstrate that EvoSpeak produces more effective heuristics, improves evolutionary efficiency, and delivers human-readable reports that enhance usability. By coupling the symbolic reasoning power of GP with the interpretative and generative strengths of LLMs, EvoSpeak advances the development of intelligent, transparent, and user-aligned heuristics for real-world optimization problems.</p></details> |  |

It therefore remains unclear whether such generalist agents can automate more sophisticated and specialized work such as software engineering (SWE). To investigate this, we introduce $\texttt{Programming with Pixels}$ (PwP), the first comprehensive computer-use environment for software engineering, where agents visually control an IDE to perform diverse software engineering tasks. To enable holistic evaluation, we also introduce \texttt{PwP-Bench}, a benchmark of 15 existing and new software-engineering tasks spanning multiple modalities, programming languages, and skillsets. We perform an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art open-weight and closed-weight CUAs and find that when interacting purely visually, they perform significantly worse than specialized coding agents. However, when the same CUAs are given direct access to just two APIs-file editing and bash operations-performance jumps, often reaching the levels of specialized agents despite having a task-agnostic design. Furthermore, when given access to additional IDE tools via text APIs, all models show further gains. Our analysis shows that current CUAs fall short mainly due to limited visual grounding and the inability to take full advantage of the rich environment, leaving clear room for future improvements.PwP establishes software engineering as a natural domain for benchmarking whether generalist computer-use agents can reach specialist-level performance on sophisticated tasks.

Recent work on sparse tensor compilers has extended this paradigm to sparse tensors (i.e., tensors where most entries are not explicitly represented). With these systems, users define the semantics of the program and the algorithmic decisions in a concise language that can be compiled to efficient low-level code. However, these systems still require users to make complex decisions about program structure and memory layouts to write efficient programs. This work presents Galley, a system for declarative tensor programming that allows users to write efficient tensor programs without making complex algorithmic decisions. Galley is the first system to perform cost based lowering of sparse tensor algebra to the imperative language of sparse tensor compilers, and the first to optimize arbitrary operators beyond sum and product. First, it decomposes the input program into a sequence of aggregation steps through a novel extension of the FAQ framework. Second, Galley optimizes and converts each aggregation step to a concrete program, which is compiled and executed with a sparse tensor compiler. We show that Galley produces programs that are 1-300x faster than competing methods for machine learning over joins and 5-20x faster than a state-of-the-art relational database for subgraph counting workloads with a minimal optimization overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Programming Distributed Collective Processes in the eXchange Calculus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11212v6)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent trends like the Internet of Things (IoT) suggest a vision of dense and multi-scale deployments of computing devices in nearly all kinds of environments. A prominent engineering challenge revolves around programming the collective adaptive behaviour of such computational ecosystems. This requires abstractions able to capture concepts like ensembles (dynamic groups of cooperating devices) and collective tasks (joint activities carried out by ensembles). In this work, we consider collections of devices interacting with neighbours and that execute in nearly-synchronised sense-compute-interact rounds, where the computation is given by a single program mapping sensing values and incoming messages to output and outcoming messages. To support programming whole computational collectives, we propose the abstraction of a distributed collective process, which can be used to define at once the ensemble formation logic and its collective task. We formalise the abstraction in the eXchange Calculus (XC), a core functional language based on neighbouring values (maps from neighbours to values) where state and interaction is handled through a single primitive, exchange, and provide a corresponding implementation in the FCPP language. Then, we exercise distributed collective processes using two case studies: multi-hop message propagation and distributed monitoring of spatial properties. Finally, we discuss the features of the abstraction and its suitability for different kinds of distributed computing applications.</p></details> |  |

We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science, physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 154 coding tasks collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent, AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models. AlgoTuner uses a simple, budgeted loop that edits code, compiles and runs it, profiles performance, verifies correctness on tests, and selects the fastest valid version. AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers, which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Speeding up Program Repair with Non-Autoregressive Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01825v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enlightened by the success of machine learning techniques in various application areas, recent years have witnessed a surge of research efforts on automatic program repair (APR) using machine learning techniques. Previous machine learning-based APR techniques essentially modified bugs in the autoregressive (AR) manner, which predicts future values based on past values. Due to the manner of token-by-token generation, the AR-based APR technique has a huge time delay. In particular, the delay of the APR model with a large number of parameters is more serious. To address the issue, we aim to apply the non-autoregressive (NAR) method to the APR task, which can output target code in a parallel manner to avoid huge repair delays. However, the naive use of the NAR manner for the APR task suffers from the issue of compromised patch quality. To effectively adapt the NAR manner for the APR task, we in this paper propose NARRepair, the first customized NAR code generation model for the APR task. The NARRepair model features three major novelties, including 1) the repair action predictor for alleviating the over-correction issue, 2) the inter-token dependency extractor for alleviating the issue of lacking inter-token dependency information, and 3) the two-stage decoder for alleviating the issue of lacking contextual information. We evaluated NARRepair on three widely used datasets in the APR community, and the results show that 1) compared to other APR techniques, the NARRepair model has the best performance within the limited repair time, and 2) compared to AR-based APR techniques, the repair speed of NARRepair has been increased by 1.4-6.4 times in the GPU environment. Overall, the results show that NARRepair has achieved state-of-the-art comprehensive performance in terms of repair speed and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2406.16526</p></details> |

In the context of using a BNN for classification, the verification problem seeks to determine whether a small perturbation of a given input can lead it to be misclassified by the BNN, and the robustness of the BNN can be measured by solving the verification problem over multiple inputs. The BNN verification problem can be formulated as an integer programming (IP) problem. However, the natural IP formulation is often challenging to solve due to a large integrality gap induced by big-$M$ constraints. We present two techniques to improve the IP formulation. First, we introduce a new method for obtaining a linear objective for the multi-class setting. Second, we introduce a new technique for generating valid inequalities for the IP formulation that exploits the recursive structure of BNNs. We find that our techniques enable verifying BNNs against a higher range of input perturbation than existing IP approaches within a limited time.</p></details> |  |

While these tools can boost productivity and code quality, concerns remain about over-reliance and potential impacts on conceptual learning. Objective: To investigate how ChatGPT access affects code quality, conceptual understanding, task completion times, and student perceptions in a CS1 course. Methods: We conducted a counterbalanced, quasi-experimental study in which students alternated between ChatGPT and non-ChatGPT conditions across two programming assignments in C (functions and structures). We evaluated their code submissions using multidimensional rubrics, conceptual post-surveys, and task completion time. Results: Students who had access to ChatGPT produced significantly higher rubric scores for code quality and completed tasks in less time compared to those without access. However, gains in conceptual understanding were mixed, lower for the functions topic but higher for the structures topic. Students reported positive experiences with ChatGPT, citing its value for debugging and practice, while expressing concerns about accuracy and long-term skill development. Conclusions: ChatGPT can enhance code quality and efficiency for novice programmers, but may not uniformly improve conceptual understanding. Structured integration and complementary instructional strategies are recommended to foster independent problem-solving skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGCITE'25</p></details> |

For exact synthesis of a target unitary, we formulate a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that linearly handles global-phase equivalence and uses explicit parallel scheduling variables to certify depth-optimal solutions for small-to-medium circuits. Domain-specific valid constraints, including identity ordering, commuting-gate pruning, short-sequence redundancy cuts, and Hermitian-conjugate linkages, significantly accelerate branch-and-bound, yielding speedups up to 43x on standard benchmarks. The framework supports hardware-aware objectives, enabling fault-tolerant (e.g. T-count) and NISQ-era (e.g. entangling gates) devices. For approximate synthesis, we propose 3 objectives: (i) exact, but non-convex, phase-invariant fidelity maximization; (ii) a linear surrogate that maximizes the real trace overlap, yielding a tight lower bound to fidelity; and (iii) a convex quadratic function that minimizes the circuit's Frobenius error. To scale beyond exact MILP, we propose a novel rolling-horizon optimization (RHO) that rolls primarily in time, caps the active-qubits, and enforces per-qubit closure while globally optimizing windowed segments. This preserves local context, reduces the Hilbert-space dimension, and enables iterative improvements without ancillas. On a 142-gate seed circuit, RHO yields 116 gates, an 18.3% reduction from the seed, while avoiding the trade-off between myopic passes and long run times. Empirically, our exact compilation framework achieves certified depth-optimal circuits on standard targets, high-fidelity Fibonacci-anyon weaves, and a 36% gate-count reduction on multi-body parity circuits. All methods are in the open-source QuantumCircuitOpt, providing a single framework that bridges exact certification and scalable synthesis.</p></details> |  |

The practical quality of these solutions, however, critically depends on rounding them to rank-1 matrices, a condition that can be challenging to achieve. In this work, we focus on trace-constrained SDPs (TCSDPs), where the decision variables are Positive Semi-Definite (PSD) matrices with fixed trace values. We show that the latter can be used to design a gradient-based refinement procedure that projects relaxed SDP solutions toward rank-1, low-cost candidates. We also provide fixed-trace SDP relaxations for common robotic quantities, such as rotations and translations, and a modular virtual robot abstraction that simplifies modeling across different problem settings. We demonstrate that our trace-constrained SDP framework can be applied to many robotics tasks, and we showcase its effectiveness through simulations in Perspective-n-Point (PnP) estimation, hand-eye calibration, and dual-robot system calibration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to American Control Conference (ACC) 2026</p></details> |
| **[EVALOOOP: A Self-Consistency-Centered Framework for Assessing Large Language Model Robustness in Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12185v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the programming robustness of large language models (LLMs) is paramount for ensuring their reliability in AI-based software development. However, adversarial attacks exhibit fundamental limitations that compromise fair robustness assessment: they demonstrate contradictory evaluation outcomes where different attack strategies tend to favor different models, and more critically, they operate solely through external perturbations, failing to capture the intrinsic stability essential for autonomous coding agents where subsequent inputs are endogenously generated by the model itself. We introduce EVALOOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluates robustness from a self-consistency perspective, leveraging the natural duality inherent in software engineering tasks (e.g., code generation and code summarization). EVALOOOP establishes a self-contained feedback loop where an LLM iteratively transforms between code and natural language until functional failure occurs, with robustness quantified by a novel Average Sustainable Loops (ASL) metric-the mean number of iterations maintaining functional correctness across benchmark tasks. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without relying on external attack configurations, providing a unified metric that reveals how effectively LLMs preserve semantic integrity through sustained self-referential transformations. We evaluate 96 popular LLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 685B parameters, on EVALOOOP equipped with the MBPP Plus benchmark, and found that EVALOOOP typically induces a 2.65%-47.62% absolute drop in pass@1 accuracy within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507, despite inferior initial code generation compared to OpenAI's o-series models and DeepSeek-V3, demonstrated the superior robustness (ASL score).</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |
| **[GDLNN: Marriage of Programming Language and Neural Networks for Accurate and Easy-to-Explain Graph Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00374v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GDLNN, a new graph machine learning architecture, for graph classification tasks. GDLNN combines a domain-specific programming language, called GDL, with neural networks. The main strength of GDLNN lies in its GDL layer, which generates expressive and interpretable graph representations. Since the graph representation is interpretable, existing model explanation techniques can be directly applied to explain GDLNN's predictions. Our evaluation shows that the GDL-based representation achieves high accuracy on most graph classification benchmark datasets, outperforming dominant graph learning methods such as GNNs. Applying an existing model explanation technique also yields high-quality explanations of GDLNN's predictions. Furthermore, the cost of GDLNN is low when the explanation cost is included.</p></details> |  |
| **[Which Programming Language and Model Work Best With LLM-as-a-Judge For Code Retrieval?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00324v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code search is an important information retrieval application. Benefits of better code search include faster new developer on-boarding, reduced software maintenance, and ease of understanding for large repositories. Despite improvements in search algorithms and search benchmarks, the domain of code search has lagged behind. One reason is the high cost of human annotation for code queries and answers. While humans may annotate search results in general text QA systems, code annotations require specialized knowledge of a programming language (PL), as well as domain specific software engineering knowledge. In this work we study the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to retrieve code at the level of functions and to generate annotations for code search results. We compare the impact of the retriever representation (sparse vs. semantic), programming language, and LLM by comparing human annotations across several popular languages (C, Java, Javascript, Go, and Python). We focus on repositories that implement common data structures likely to be implemented in any PLs. For the same human annotations, we compare several LLM-as-a-Judge models to evaluate programming language and other affinities between LLMs. We find that the chosen retriever and PL exhibit affinities that can be leveraged to improve alignment of human and AI relevance determinations, with significant performance implications. We also find differences in representation (sparse vs. semantic) across PLs that impact alignment of human and AI relevance determinations. We propose using transpilers to bootstrap scalable code search benchmark datasets in other PLs and in a case study demonstrate that human-AI relevance agreement rates largely match the (worst case) human-human agreement under study. The application code used in this work is available at \href{https://github.com/rlucas7/code-searcher/}{this github repo}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper at SIGIR-AP 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Trajectory Bundle Method: Unifying Sequential-Convex Programming and Sampling-Based Trajectory Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26575v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a unified framework for solving trajectory optimization problems in a derivative-free manner through the use of sequential convex programming. Traditionally, nonconvex optimization problems are solved by forming and solving a sequence of convex optimization problems, where the cost and constraint functions are approximated locally through Taylor series expansions. This presents a challenge for functions where differentiation is expensive or unavailable. In this work, we present a derivative-free approach to form these convex approximations by computing samples of the dynamics, cost, and constraint functions and letting the solver interpolate between them. Our framework includes sample-based trajectory optimization techniques like model-predictive path integral (MPPI) control as a special case and generalizes them to enable features like multiple shooting and general equality and inequality constraints that are traditionally associated with derivative-based sequential convex programming methods. The resulting framework is simple, flexible, and capable of solving a wide variety of practical motion planning and control problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A systematic comparison of Large Language Models for automated assignment assessment in programming education: Exploring the importance of architecture and vendor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26483v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents the first large-scale, side-by-side comparison of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) in the automated grading of programming assignments. Drawing on over 6,000 student submissions collected across four years of an introductory programming course, we systematically analysed the distribution of grades, differences in mean scores and variability reflecting stricter or more lenient grading, and the consistency and clustering of grading patterns across models. Eighteen publicly available models were evaluated: Anthropic (claude-3-5-haiku, claude-opus-4-1, claude-sonnet-4); Deepseek (deepseek-chat, deepseek-reasoner); Google (gemini-2.0-flash-lite, gemini-2.0-flash, gemini-2.5-flash-lite, gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro); and OpenAI (gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1-nano, gpt-4.1, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-nano, gpt-5). Statistical tests, correlation and clustering analyses revealed clear, systematic differences between and within vendor families, with "mini" and "nano" variants consistently underperforming their full-scale counterparts. All models displayed high internal agreement, measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient, with the model consensus but only moderate agreement with human teachers' grades, indicating a persistent gap between automated and human assessment. These findings underscore that the choice of model for educational deployment is not neutral and should be guided by pedagogical goals, transparent reporting of evaluation metrics, and ongoing human oversight to ensure accuracy, fairness and relevance.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Code to Concept: Evaluating Multiple Coordinated Views in Introductory Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26466v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novice programmers often struggle to understand how code executes and to form the abstract mental models necessary for effective problem-solving, challenges that are amplified in large, diverse introductory courses where students' backgrounds, language proficiencies, and prior experiences vary widely. This study examines whether interactive, multi-representational visualizations, combining synchronized code views, memory diagrams, and conceptual analogies, can help manage cognitive load and foster engagement more effectively than single-visual or text-only approaches. Over a 12-week deployment in a high-enrolment introductory Python course (N = 829), students who relied solely on text-based explanations reported significantly higher immediate mental effort than those using visual aids, although overall cognitive load did not differ significantly among conditions. The multi-representational approach consistently yielded higher engagement than both single-visual and text-only methods. Usage logs indicated that learners' interaction patterns varied with topic complexity, and predictive modelling suggested that early experiences of high cognitive load were associated with lower longer-term perceptions of clarity and helpfulness. Individual differences, including language proficiency and prior programming experience, moderated these patterns. By integrating multiple external representations with scaffolded support adapted to diverse learner profiles, our findings highlight design considerations for creating visualization tools that more effectively support novices learning to program.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Language Object-Oriented Programming Benchmark for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26111v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Establishing fair and robust benchmarks is essential for evaluating intelligent code generation by large language models (LLMs). Our survey of 35 existing benchmarks uncovers three major imbalances: 85.7% focus on a single programming language; 94.3% target only function-level or statement-level tasks; and over 80% include fewer than ten test cases on average. To address these gaps, we propose MultiOOP, a multi-language object-oriented programming benchmark covering six popular languages (Python, PHP, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript) with 267 tasks per language. We design a translator that extends an existing single-language OOP benchmark and the pass@o metric to a multilingual setting. Moreover, we propose an automated framework for augmenting test cases to ensure the reliability of the evaluation results. We evaluate 14 mainstream LLMs under zero-shot prompting and report three key findings: 1) Substantial performance degradation: pass@1 scores on MultiOOP drop by up to 65.6 percentage points compared to function-level tasks (e.g., HumanEval). 2) Cross-language variability: GPT-4o mini achieves pass@1 of 48.06% in Python but only 0.12%-15.26% in other languages, indicating limited multilingual generalization. 3) Conceptual gaps: pass@o scores are consistently 1.1-19.2 points lower than pass@k, demonstrating that LLMs often generate executable code without fully capturing core OOP concepts. Our benchmark, metric extensions, and evaluation scripts will be publicly released to foster a more balanced and comprehensive assessment of LLMs in object-oriented code generation. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/alphadl/OOP-eval and https://huggingface.co/datasets/codeai-dteam/MultiOOP respectively.</p></details> | 20 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Red Teaming Program Repair Agents: When Correct Patches can Hide Vulnerabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25894v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed for software maintenance tasks such as automated program repair (APR). APR agents automatically fetch GitHub issues and use backend LLMs to generate patches that fix the reported bugs. However, existing work primarily focuses on the functional correctness of APR-generated patches, whether they pass hidden or regression tests, while largely ignoring potential security risks. Given the openness of platforms like GitHub, where any user can raise issues and participate in discussions, an important question arises: Can an adversarial user submit a valid issue on GitHub that misleads an LLM-based agent into generating a functionally correct but vulnerable patch? To answer this question, we propose SWExploit, which generates adversarial issue statements designed to make APR agents produce patches that are functionally correct yet vulnerable. SWExploit operates in three main steps: (1) program analysis to identify potential injection points for vulnerable payloads; (2) adversarial issue generation to provide misleading reproduction and error information while preserving the original issue semantics; and (3) iterative refinement of the adversarial issue statements based on the outputs of the APR agents. Empirical evaluation on three agent pipelines and five backend LLMs shows that SWExploit can produce patches that are both functionally correct and vulnerable (the attack success rate on the correct patch could reach 0.91, whereas the baseline ASRs are all below 0.20). Based on our evaluation, we are the first to challenge the traditional assumption that a patch passing all tests is inherently reliable and secure, highlighting critical limitations in the current evaluation paradigm for APR agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Fault Localization for Programming Assignments via LLM-Guided Annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25676v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Providing timely and personalized guidance for students' programming assignments, offers significant practical value for helping students complete assignments and enhance their learning. In recent years, various automated Fault Localization (FL) techniques have demonstrated promising results in identifying errors in programs. However, existing FL techniques face challenges when applied to educational contexts. Most approaches operate at the method level without explanatory feedback, resulting in granularity too coarse for students who need actionable insights to identify and fix their errors. While some approaches attempt line-level fault localization, they often depend on predicting line numbers directly in numerical form, which is ill-suited to LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose FLAME, a fine-grained, explainable Fault Localization method tailored for programming assignments via LLM-guided Annotation and Model Ensemble. FLAME leverages rich contextual information specific to programming assignments to guide LLMs in identifying faulty code lines. Instead of directly predicting line numbers, we prompt the LLM to annotate faulty code lines with detailed explanations, enhancing both localization accuracy and educational value. To further improve reliability, we introduce a weighted multi-model voting strategy that aggregates results from multiple LLMs to determine the suspiciousness of each code line. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FLAME outperforms state-of-the-art fault localization baselines on programming assignments, successfully localizing 207 more faults at top-1 over the best-performing baseline. Beyond educational contexts, FLAME also generalizes effectively to general-purpose software codebases, outperforming all baselines on the Defects4J benchmark.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE'2025 |
| **[Quadratic Programming Approach for Nash Equilibrium Computation in Multiplayer Imperfect-Information Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25618v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been significant recent progress in algorithms for approximation of Nash equilibrium in large two-player zero-sum imperfect-information games and exact computation of Nash equilibrium in multiplayer strategic-form games. While counterfactual regret minimization and fictitious play are scalable to large games and have convergence guarantees in two-player zero-sum games, they do not guarantee convergence to Nash equilibrium in multiplayer games. We present an approach for exact computation of Nash equilibrium in multiplayer imperfect-information games that solves a quadratically-constrained program based on a nonlinear complementarity problem formulation from the sequence-form game representation. This approach capitalizes on recent advances for solving nonconvex quadratic programs. Our algorithm is able to quickly solve three-player Kuhn poker after removal of dominated actions. Of the available algorithms in the Gambit software suite, only the logit quantal response approach is successfully able to solve the game; however, the approach takes longer than our algorithm and also involves a degree of approximation. Our formulation also leads to a new approach for computing Nash equilibrium in multiplayer strategic-form games which we demonstrate to outperform a previous quadratically-constrained program formulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lobster: A GPU-Accelerated Framework for Neurosymbolic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21937v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neurosymbolic programs combine deep learning with symbolic reasoning to achieve better data efficiency, interpretability, and generalizability compared to standalone deep learning approaches. However, existing neurosymbolic learning frameworks implement an uneasy marriage between a highly scalable, GPU-accelerated neural component and a slower symbolic component that runs on CPUs. We propose Lobster, a unified framework for harnessing GPUs in an end-to-end manner for neurosymbolic learning. Lobster maps a general neurosymbolic language based on Datalog to the GPU programming paradigm. This mapping is implemented via compilation to a new intermediate language called APM. The extra abstraction provided by apm allows Lobster to be both flexible, supporting discrete, probabilistic, and differentiable modes of reasoning on GPU hardware with a library of provenance semirings, and performant, implementing new optimization passes. We demonstrate that Lobster programs can solve interesting problems spanning the domains of natural language processing, image processing, program reasoning, bioinformatics, and planning. On a suite of 9 applications, Lobster achieves an average speedup of 3.9x over Scallop, a state-of-the-art neurosymbolic framework, and enables scaling of neurosymbolic solutions to previously infeasible tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ASPLOS 2026</p></details> |

| **[Data-Driven Discrete Geofence Design Using Binary Quadratic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24679v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geofences have attracted significant attention in the design of spatial and virtual regions for managing and engaging spatiotemporal events. By using geofences to monitor human activity across their boundaries, content providers can create spatially triggered events that include notifications about points of interest within a geofence by pushing spatial information to the devices of users. Traditionally, geofences were hand-crafted by providers. In addition to the hand-crafted approach, recent advances in collecting human mobility data through mobile devices can accelerate the automatic and data-driven design of geofences, also known as the geofence design problem. Previous approaches assume circular shapes; thus, their flexibility is insufficient, and they can only handle geofence-based applications for large areas with coarse resolutions. A challenge with using circular geofences in urban and high-resolution areas is that they often overlap and fail to align with political district boundaries and road segments, such as one-way streets and median barriers. In this study, we address the problem of extracting arbitrary shapes as geofences from human mobility data to mitigate this problem. In our formulation, we cast the existing optimization problems for circular geofences to 0-1 integer programming problems to represent arbitrary shapes. Although 0-1 integer programming problems are computationally hard, formulating them as quadratic (unconstrained) binary optimization problems enables efficient approximation of optimal solutions, because this allows the use of specialized quadratic solvers, such as the quantum annealing, and other state-of-the-art algorithms. We then develop and compare different formulation methods to extract discrete geofences. We confirmed that our new modeling approach enables flexible geofence design.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 17 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce MSG, an automated specification generation tool designed for Move smart contracts. MSG aims to highlight key insights that uniquely present when applying LLM-based specification generation to a new ecosystem. Specifically, MSG demonstrates that LLMs exhibit robust code comprehension and generation capabilities even for non-mainstream languages. MSG successfully generates verifiable specifications for 84% of tested Move functions and even identifies clauses previously overlooked by experts. Additionally, MSG shows that explicitly leveraging specification language features through an agentic, modular design improves specification quality substantially (generating 57% more verifiable clauses than conventional designs). Incorporating feedback from the verification toolchain further enhances the effectiveness of MSG, leading to a 30% increase in generated verifiable specifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages; Extended version of ASE'25 paper with extra appendices</p></details> |

However, the NP-hard nature of MILP presents a significant computational challenge, motivating the development of machine learning-based heuristic solutions to accelerate downstream solvers. While recent generative models have shown promise in learning powerful heuristics, they suffer from a critical limitation. That is, they model the distribution of only the integer variables and fail to capture the intricate coupling between integer and continuous variables, creating an information bottleneck and ultimately leading to suboptimal solutions. To this end, we propose Joint Continuous-Integer Flow for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (FMIP), which is the first generative framework that models the joint distribution of both integer and continuous variables for MILP solutions. Built upon the joint modeling paradigm, a holistic guidance mechanism is designed to steer the generative trajectory, actively refining solutions toward optimality and feasibility during the inference process. Extensive experiments on eight standard MILP benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of FMIP against existing baselines, reducing the primal gap by 41.34% on average. Moreover, we show that FMIP is fully compatible with arbitrary backbone networks and various downstream solvers, making it well-suited for a broad range of real-world MILP applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>FMIP ...</summary><p>FMIP is a generative framework that jointly models integer and continuous variables in MILP, achieving a 41.34% reduction in primal gap and demonstrating compatibility with various solvers and applications</p></details> |
