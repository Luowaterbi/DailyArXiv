| **[Reed-Muller Error-Correction Code Encoder for SFQ-to-CMOS Interface Circuits](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11140v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data transmission from superconducting digital electronics such as single flux quantum (SFQ) logic to semiconductor (CMOS) circuits is subject to bit errors due to, e.g., flux trapping, process parameter variations (PPV), and fabrication defects. In this paper, a lightweight hardware-efficient error-correction code encoder is designed and analyzed. Particularly, a Reed-Muller code RM(1,3) encoder is implemented with SFQ digital logic. The proposed RM(1,3) encoder converts a 4-bit message into an 8-bit codeword and can detect and correct up to 3- and 1-bit errors, respectively. This encoder circuit is designed using MIT-LL SFQ5ee process and SuperTools/ColdFlux RSFQ cell library. A simulation framework integrating JoSIM simulator and MATLAB script for automated data collection and analysis, is proposed to study the performance of RM(1,3) encoder. The proposed encoder improves the probability of having no bit errors by 6.7% as compared to an encoder-less design under $\pm20\%$ PPV. With $\pm15\%$ and lower PPV, the proposed encoder could correct all errors with at least 99.1% probability. The impact of fabrication defects such as open circuit faults on the encoder circuit is also studied using the proposed framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Applied Superconductivity</p></details> |
| **[Eulerian orientations and Hadamard codes: A novel connection via counting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02612v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We discover a novel connection between two classical mathematical notions, Eulerian orientations and Hadamard codes by studying the counting problem of Eulerian orientations (\#EO) with local constraint functions imposed on vertices. We present two special classes of constraint functions and a chain reaction algorithm, and show that the \#EO problem defined by each class alone is polynomial-time solvable by the algorithm. These tractable classes of functions are defined inductively, and quite remarkably the base level of these classes is characterized perfectly by the well-known Hadamard code. Thus, we establish a novel connection between counting Eulerian orientations and coding theory. We also prove a \#P-hardness result for the \#EO problem when constraint functions from the two tractable classes appear together.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, accepted by ITCS 2025</p></details> |
| **[FeatureBench: Benchmarking Agentic Coding for Complex Feature Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10975v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents powered by large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted in the software industry, contributing code as collaborators or even autonomous developers. As their presence grows, it becomes important to assess the current boundaries of their coding abilities. Existing agentic coding benchmarks, however, cover a limited task scope, e.g., bug fixing within a single pull request (PR), and often rely on non-executable evaluations or lack an automated approach for continually updating the evaluation coverage. To address such issues, we propose FeatureBench, a benchmark designed to evaluate agentic coding performance in end-to-end, feature-oriented software development. FeatureBench incorporates an execution-based evaluation protocol and a scalable test-driven method that automatically derives tasks from code repositories with minimal human effort. By tracing from unit tests along a dependency graph, our approach can identify feature-level coding tasks spanning multiple commits and PRs scattered across the development timeline, while ensuring the proper functioning of other features after the separation. Using this framework, we curated 200 challenging evaluation tasks and 3825 executable environments from 24 open-source repositories in the first version of our benchmark. Empirical evaluation reveals that the state-of-the-art agentic model, such as Claude 4.5 Opus, which achieves a 74.4% resolved rate on SWE-bench, succeeds on only 11.0% of tasks, opening new opportunities for advancing agentic coding. Moreover, benefiting from our automated task collection toolkit, FeatureBench can be easily scaled and updated over time to mitigate data leakage. The inherent verifiability of constructed environments also makes our method potentially valuable for agent training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[Towards Better Code Understanding in Decoder-Only Models with Contrastive Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.12326v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large-scale code generation models have led to remarkable progress in producing high-quality code. These models are trained in a self-supervised manner on extensive unlabeled code corpora using a decoder-only architecture. However, despite their generative strength, decoder-only models often exhibit limited performance on code understanding tasks such as code search and clone detection, primarily due to their generation-oriented training objectives. While training large encoder-only models from scratch on massive code datasets can improve understanding ability but remains computationally expensive and time-consuming. In this paper, we explore a more efficient alternative by transferring knowledge from pre-trained decoder-only code generation models to code understanding tasks. We investigate how decoder-only architectures can be effectively adapted to learn discriminative and semantically meaningful code representations. To this end, we propose CL4D, a contrastive learning framework tailored to strengthen the representation capabilities of decoder-only models. Extensive experiments on multiple benchmark datasets demonstrate that CL4D achieves competitive or superior performance compared to existing methods on representative code understanding tasks, including code search and clone detection. Further analysis reveals that CL4D substantially improves the semantic alignment of code representations by reducing the distance between semantically similar code snippets. These findings highlight the feasibility of leveraging decoder-only models as a unified backbone for both code generation and understanding.</p></details> | AAAI 2026 |
| **[Chart Specification: Structural Representations for Incentivizing VLM Reasoning in Chart-to-Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10880v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have shown promise in generating plotting code from chart images, yet achieving structural fidelity remains challenging. Existing approaches largely rely on supervised fine-tuning, encouraging surface-level token imitation rather than faithful modeling of underlying chart structure, which often leads to hallucinated or semantically inconsistent outputs. We propose Chart Specification, a structured intermediate representation that shifts training from text imitation to semantically grounded supervision. Chart Specification filters syntactic noise to construct a structurally balanced training set and supports a Spec-Align Reward that provides fine-grained, verifiable feedback on structural correctness, enabling reinforcement learning to enforce consistent plotting logic. Experiments on three public benchmarks show that our method consistently outperforms prior approaches. With only 3K training samples, we achieve strong data efficiency, surpassing leading baselines by up to 61.7% on complex benchmarks, and scaling to 4K samples establishes new state-of-the-art results across all evaluated metrics. Overall, our results demonstrate that precise structural supervision offers an efficient pathway to high-fidelity chart-to-code generation.

| **[SimuScene: Training and Benchmarking Code Generation to Simulate Physical Scenarios](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10840v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have been extensively studied for tasks like math competitions, complex coding, and scientific reasoning, yet their ability to accurately represent and simulate physical scenarios via code remains underexplored. We propose SimuScene, the first systematic study that trains and evaluates LLMs on simulating physical scenarios across five physics domains and 52 physical concepts. We build an automatic pipeline to collect data, with human verification to ensure quality. The final dataset contains 7,659 physical scenarios with 334 human-verified examples as the test set. We evaluated 10 contemporary LLMs and found that even the strongest model achieves only a 21.5% pass rate, demonstrating the difficulty of the task. Finally, we introduce a reinforcement learning pipeline with visual rewards that uses a vision-language model as a judge to train textual models. Experiments show that training with our data improves physical simulation via code while substantially enhancing general code generation performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[GoodVibe: Security-by-Vibe for LLM-Based Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10778v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for code generation in fast, informal development workflows, often referred to as vibe coding, where speed and convenience are prioritized, and security requirements are rarely made explicit. In this setting, models frequently produce functionally correct but insecure code, creating a growing security risk. Existing approaches to improving code security rely on full-parameter fine-tuning or parameter-efficient adaptations, which are either costly and prone to catastrophic forgetting or operate at coarse granularity with limited interpretability and control. We present GoodVibe, a neuron-level framework for improving the security of code language models by default. GoodVibe is based on the key insight that security-relevant reasoning is localized to a small subset of neurons. We identify these neurons using gradient-based attribution from a supervised security task and perform neuron-selective fine-tuning that updates only this security-critical subspace. To further reduce training cost, we introduce activation-driven neuron clustering, enabling structured updates with minimal overhead. We evaluate GoodVibe on six LLMs across security-critical programming languages, including C++, Java, Swift, and Go. GoodVibe substantially improves the security of generated code while preserving general model utility, achieving up to a 2.5x improvement over base models, matching or exceeding full fine-tuning with over 4,700x fewer trainable parameters, and reducing training computation by more than 3.6x compared to the parameter-efficient baseline (LoRA). Our results demonstrate that neuron-level optimization offers an effective and scalable approach to securing code generation without sacrificing efficiency or generality.</p></details> |  |
| **[LOREN: Low Rank-Based Code-Rate Adaptation in Neural Receivers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10770v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network based receivers have recently demonstrated superior system-level performance compared to traditional receivers. However, their practicality is limited by high memory and power requirements, as separate weight sets must be stored for each code rate. To address this challenge, we propose LOREN, a Low Rank-Based Code-Rate Adaptation Neural Receiver that achieves adaptability with minimal overhead. LOREN integrates lightweight low rank adaptation adapters (LOREN adapters) into convolutional layers, freezing a shared base network while training only small adapters per code rate. An end-to-end training framework over 3GPP CDL channels ensures robustness across realistic wireless environments. LOREN achieves comparable or superior performance relative to fully retrained base neural receivers. The hardware implementation of LOREN in 22nm technology shows more than 65% savings in silicon area and up to 15% power reduction when supporting three code rates.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to / To appear IEEE Wireless Communications and Networking Conference Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia 13 - 16 April 2026</p></details> |
| **[CODE-SHARP: Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10085v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing agents capable of open-endedly discovering and learning novel skills is a grand challenge in Artificial Intelligence. While reinforcement learning offers a powerful framework for training agents to master complex skills, it typically relies on hand-designed reward functions. This is infeasible for open-ended skill discovery, where the set of meaningful skills is not known a priori. While recent methods have shown promising results towards automating reward function design, they remain limited to refining rewards for pre-defined tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs (CODE-SHARP), a novel framework leveraging Foundation Models (FM) to open-endedly expand and refine a hierarchical skill archive, structured as a directed graph of executable reward functions in code. We show that a goal-conditioned agent trained exclusively on the rewards generated by the discovered SHARP skills learns to solve increasingly long-horizon goals in the Craftax environment. When composed by a high-level FM-based planner, the discovered skills enable a single goal-conditioned agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks, outperforming both pretrained agents and task-specific expert policies by over $134$% on average. We will open-source our code and provide additional videos at https://sites.google.com/view/code-sharp/homepage.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[ContextBench: A Benchmark for Context Retrieval in Coding Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05892v3)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based coding agents have shown strong performance on automated issue resolution benchmarks, yet existing evaluations largely focus on final task success, providing limited insight into how agents retrieve and use code context during problem solving. We introduce ContextBench, a process-oriented evaluation of context retrieval in coding agents. ContextBench consists of 1,136 issue-resolution tasks from 66 repositories across eight programming languages, each augmented with human-annotated gold contexts. We further implement an automated evaluation framework that tracks agent trajectories and measures context recall, precision, and efficiency throughout issue resolution. Using ContextBench, we evaluate four frontier LLMs and five coding agents. Our results show that sophisticated agent scaffolding yields only marginal gains in context retrieval ("The Bitter Lesson" of coding agents), LLMs consistently favor recall over precision, and substantial gaps exist between explored and utilized context. ContextBench augments existing end-to-end benchmarks with intermediate gold-context metrics that unbox the issue-resolution process. These contexts offer valuable intermediate signals for guiding LLM reasoning in software tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Following Dragons: Code Review-Guided Fuzzing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10487v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern fuzzers scale to large, real-world software but often fail to exercise the program states developers consider most fragile or security-critical. Such states are typically deep in the execution space, gated by preconditions, or overshadowed by lower-value paths that consume limited fuzzing budgets. Meanwhile, developers routinely surface risk-relevant insights during code review, yet this information is largely ignored by automated testing tools. We present EyeQ, a system that leverages developer intelligence from code reviews to guide fuzzing. EyeQ extracts security-relevant signals from review discussions, localizes the implicated program regions, and translates these insights into annotation-based guidance for fuzzing. The approach operates atop existing annotation-aware fuzzing, requiring no changes to program semantics or developer workflows. We first validate EyeQ through a human-guided feasibility study on a security-focused dataset of PHP code reviews, establishing a strong baseline for review-guided fuzzing. We then automate the workflow using a large language model with carefully designed prompts. EyeQ significantly improves vulnerability discovery over standard fuzzing configurations, uncovering more than 40 previously unknown bugs in the security-critical PHP codebase.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Human Guidance Matters in Collaborative Vibe Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10473v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Writing code has been one of the most transformative ways for human societies to translate abstract ideas into tangible technologies. Modern AI is transforming this process by enabling experts and non-experts alike to generate code without actually writing code, but instead, through natural language instructions, or "vibe coding". While increasingly popular, the cumulative impact of vibe coding on productivity and collaboration, as well as the role of humans in this process, remains unclear. Here, we introduce a controlled experimental framework for studying collaborative vibe coding and use it to compare human-led, AI-led, and hybrid groups. Across 16 experiments involving 604 human participants, we show that people provide uniquely effective high-level instructions for vibe coding across iterations, whereas AI-provided instructions often result in performance collapse. We further demonstrate that hybrid systems perform best when humans retain directional control (providing the instructions), while evaluation is delegated to AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code2MCP: Transforming Code Repositories into MCP Services](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05941v4)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Model Context Protocol (MCP) aims to create a standard for how Large Language Models use tools. However, most current research focuses on selecting tools from an existing pool. A more fundamental, yet largely overlooked, problem is how to populate this pool by converting the vast number of existing software projects into MCP-compatible services. To bridge this gap, we introduce Code2MCP, an agent-based framework that automatically transforms a GitHub repository into a functional MCP service with minimal human intervention. Code2MCP employs a multi-agent workflow for code analysis, environment setup, tool function design, and service generation, enhanced by a self-correcting loop to ensure reliability. We demonstrate that Code2MCP successfully transforms open-source computing libraries in scientific fields such as bioinformatics, mathematics, and fluid dynamics that are not available in existing MCP servers. By providing a novel automated pathway to unlock GitHub, the world's largest code repository, for the MCP ecosystem, Code2MCP serves as a catalyst to significantly accelerate the protocol's adoption and practical application. The code is public at https://github.com/DEFENSE-SEU/Code2MCP.</p></details> |  |
| **[SecCodePRM: A Process Reward Model for Code Security](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10418v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models are rapidly becoming core components of modern software development workflows, yet ensuring code security remains challenging. Existing vulnerability detection pipelines either rely on static analyzers or use LLM/GNN-based detectors trained with coarse program-level supervision. Both families often require complete context, provide sparse end-of-completion feedback, and can degrade as code length grows, making them ill-suited for real-time, prefix-level assessment during interactive coding and streaming generation. We propose SecCodePRM, a security-oriented process reward model that assigns a context-aware, step-level security score along a code trajectory. To train the model, we derive step-level supervision labels from static analyzers and expert annotations, allowing the model to attend more precisely to fine-grained regions associated with inter-procedural vulnerabilities. SecCodePRM has three applications: full-code vulnerability detection (VD), partial-code VD, and secure code generation (CG). For VD, SecCodePRM uses risk-sensitive aggregation that emphasizes high-risk steps; for CG, SecCodePRM supports inference-time scaling by ranking candidate continuations and favoring higher cumulative reward. This design yields dense, real-time feedback that scales to long-horizon generation. Empirically, SecCodePRM outperforms prior approaches in all three settings, while preserving code functional correctness, suggesting improved security without a safety-utility tradeoff.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[SecureCode: A Production-Grade Multi-Turn Dataset for Training Security-Aware Code Generation Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18542v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI coding assistants produce vulnerable code in 45\% of security-relevant scenarios~\cite{veracode2025}, yet no public training dataset teaches both traditional web security and AI/ML-specific defenses in a format suitable for instruction tuning. We present SecureCode, a production-grade dataset of 2,185 multi-turn security training examples spanning two domains: web application security (1,435 examples covering the OWASP Top 10 2021 across 11 languages and 9 frameworks, 100\% grounded in documented CVEs and security incidents) and AI/ML security (750 examples covering all 10 OWASP LLM Top 10 2025 categories across more than 40 frameworks, including LangChain, OpenAI, and Hugging Face). Every example follows a 4-turn conversational structure -- feature request; vulnerable and secure implementations with attack demonstrations; advanced probing; and defense-in-depth operational guidance -- designed for direct use in instruction tuning pipelines. Quality assurance combines automated structural validation with multi-agent review from seven specialist AI perspectives (more than 10{,}500 assessments) and an 8-phase remediation pipeline, producing a rubric-calibrated mean quality score of 93.8/100 ($σ= 0.93$) for the AI/ML component. Each example provides SIEM integration strategies, infrastructure hardening recommendations, and testing approaches using production frameworks. We release the unified dataset on Hugging Face with domain-specific loading configurations (web, aiml, default), alongside eight fine-tuned open-source models (3B--20B parameters, QLoRA), and an evaluation framework with four security-specific metrics. To our knowledge, SecureCode is the first public dataset that jointly provides OWASP Top 10 2021 web coverage and OWASP LLM Top 10 2025 AI/ML coverage in a unified conversational schema suitable for instruction tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 12 figures, 10 tables.

| **[An Empirical Analysis of Community and Coding Patterns in OSS4SG vs. Conventional OSS](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03430v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open Source Software for Social Good (OSS4SG) projects aim to address critical societal challenges, such as healthcare access and community safety. Understanding the community dynamics and contributor patterns in these projects is essential for ensuring their sustainability and long-term impact. However, while extensive research has focused on conventional Open Source Software (OSS), little is known about how the mission-driven nature of OSS4SG influences its development practices. To address this gap, we conduct a large-scale empirical study of 1,039 GitHub repositories, comprising 422 OSS4SG and 617 conventional OSS projects, to compare community structure, contributor engagement, and coding practices. Our findings reveal that OSS4SG projects foster significantly more stable and "sticky" (63.4%) communities, whereas conventional OSS projects are more "magnetic" (75.4%), attracting a high turnover of contributors. OSS4SG projects also demonstrate consistent engagement throughout the year, while conventional OSS communities exhibit seasonal fluctuations. Additionally, OSS4SG projects rely heavily on core contributors for both code quality and issue resolution, while conventional OSS projects leverage casual contributors for issue resolution, with core contributors focusing primarily on code quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modeling Programming Skills with Source Code Embeddings for Context-aware Exercise Recommendation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10249v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a context-aware recommender system that models students' programming skills using embeddings of the source code they submit throughout a course. These embeddings predict students' skills across multiple programming topics, producing profiles that are matched to the skills required by unseen homework problems. To generate recommendations, we compute the cosine similarity between student profiles and problem skill vectors, ranking exercises according to their alignment with each student's current abilities. We evaluated our approach using real data from students and exercises in an introductory programming course at our university. First, we assessed the effectiveness of our source code embeddings for predicting skills, comparing them with token-based and graph-based alternatives. Results showed that Jina embeddings outperformed TF-IDF, CodeBERT-cpp, and GraphCodeBERT across most skills. Additionally, we evaluated the system's ability to recommend exercises aligned with weekly course content by analyzing student submissions collected over seven course offerings. Our approach consistently produced more suitable recommendations than baselines based on correctness or solution time, indicating that predicted programming skills provide a stronger signal for problem recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, to be published in LAK26: 16th International Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference (LAK 2026)</p></details> |

We propose METTLE (Multi-Edge Type with Touch-less Leading Edge), the first erasure code to meet all three requirements. Compared to "streaming RaptorQ" (RaptorQ configured with a small source block size to ensure a low decoding latency), METTLE is only slightly worse in coding efficiency, but 47.7 to 84.6 times faster to decode.</p></details> | 31 pages |
| **[Environment-in-the-Loop: Rethinking Code Migration with LLM-based Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09944v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software systems continuously undergo code upgrades to enhance functionality, security, and performance, and Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code migration tasks. However, while research on automated code migration which including refactoring, API adaptation, and dependency updates has advanced rapidly, the exploration of the automated environment interaction that must accompany it remains relatively scarce. In practice, code and its environment are intricately intertwined. Relying solely on static analysis of the environment leads to an inadequate understanding of the target setting, prolongs feedback cycles, and consequently causes significant rework and project delays, thereby reducing overall efficiency. We contend that successful software evolution demands a holistic perspective that integrates both code and environment migration. To understand the current landscape and challenges, we first provide an overview of the status of automated environment construction. We then propose a novel framework paradigm that tightly integrates automated environment setup with the code migration workflow. Finally, we explore the challenges and future directions for automated environment interaction within the code migration domain. Our findings emphasize that without automated environment interaction, the automation of code migration is only half complete.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fully Parallelized BP Decoding for Quantum LDPC Codes Can Outperform BP-OSD](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00254v3)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work presents a hardware-efficient and fully parallelizable decoder for quantum LDPC codes that leverages belief propagation (BP) with a speculative post-processing strategy inspired by classical Chase decoding algorithm. By monitoring bit-level oscillation patterns during BP, our method identifies unreliable bits and generates multiple candidate vectors to selectively flip syndromes. Each modified syndrome is then decoded independently using short-depth BP, a process we refer to as BP-SF (syndrome flip). This design eliminates the need for costly Gaussian elimination used in the current BP-OSD approaches. Our implementation achieves logical error rates comparable to or better than BP-OSD while offering significantly lower latency due to its high degree of parallelism for a variety of bivariate bicycle codes. Evaluation on the [[144,12,12]] bivariate bicycle code shows that the proposed decoder reduces average latency to approximately $70\%$ of BP-OSD. When post-processing is parallelized the average latency is reduced by $55\%$ compared to the single process implementation, with the maximum latency reaching as low as $18\%$. These advantages make it particularly well-suited for real-time and resource-constrained quantum error correction systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[JMigBench: A Benchmark for Evaluating LLMs on Source Code Migration (Java 8 to Java 11)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09930v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We build a benchmark to evaluate large language models (LLMs) for source code migration tasks, specifically upgrading functions from Java 8 to Java 11. We first collected a dataset of function pairs from open-source repositories, but limitations in data quality led us to construct a refined dataset covering eight categories of deprecated APIs. Using this dataset, the Mistral Codestral model was evaluated with CodeBLEU and keyword-based metrics to measure lexical and semantic similarity as well as migration correctness. Results show that the evaluated model (Mistral Codestral) can handle trivial one-to-one API substitutions with moderate success, achieving identical migrations in 11.11% of the cases, but it struggles with more complex migrations such as CORBA or JAX-WS. These findings suggest Mistral Codestral can partially reduce developer effort by automating repetitive migration tasks but cannot yet replace humans within the scope of the JMigBench benchmark. The benchmark and analysis provide a foundation for future work on expanding datasets, refining prompting strategies, and improving migration performance across different LLMs.</p></details> |  |

By invoking Forney's cubing construction of Golay codes and their generators $G^*(8,7)/(8,4)$, we found different construction methods of Golay codes from PAC codes, which result in an efficient parallel list decoding algorithm with near-maximum likelihood performance. Compared with existing methods, our method can get rid of index permutation and codeword puncturing. Using the new decoding method, some related lattices, such as Leech lattice $Λ_{24}$ and its principal sublattice $H_{24}$, can be also decoded efficiently.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code2World: A GUI World Model via Renderable Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09856v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autonomous GUI agents interact with environments by perceiving interfaces and executing actions. As a virtual sandbox, the GUI World model empowers agents with human-like foresight by enabling action-conditioned prediction. However, existing text- and pixel-based approaches struggle to simultaneously achieve high visual fidelity and fine-grained structural controllability. To this end, we propose Code2World, a vision-language coder that simulates the next visual state via renderable code generation. Specifically, to address the data scarcity problem, we construct AndroidCode by translating GUI trajectories into high-fidelity HTML and refining synthesized code through a visual-feedback revision mechanism, yielding a corpus of over 80K high-quality screen-action pairs. To adapt existing VLMs into code prediction, we first perform SFT as a cold start for format layout following, then further apply Render-Aware Reinforcement Learning which uses rendered outcome as the reward signal by enforcing visual semantic fidelity and action consistency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Code2World-8B achieves the top-performing next UI prediction, rivaling the competitive GPT-5 and Gemini-3-Pro-Image. Notably, Code2World significantly enhances downstream navigation success rates in a flexible manner, boosting Gemini-2.5-Flash by +9.5% on AndroidWorld navigation.

| **[LLM-based Vulnerable Code Augmentation: Generate or Refactor?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08493v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vulnerability code-bases often suffer from severe imbalance, limiting the effectiveness of Deep Learning-based vulnerability classifiers. Data Augmentation could help solve this by mitigating the scarcity of under-represented vulnerability types. In this context, we investigate LLM-based augmentation for vulnerable functions, comparing controlled generation of new vulnerable samples with semantics-preserving refactoring of existing ones. Using Qwen2.5-Coder to produce augmented data and CodeBERT as a classifier on the SVEN dataset, we find that our approaches are indeed effective in enriching vulnerable code-bases through a simple process and with reasonable quality, and that a hybrid strategy best boosts vulnerability classifiers' performance.

| **[EvoCodeBench: A Human-Performance Benchmark for Self-Evolving LLM-Driven Coding Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10171v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) continue to advance in programming tasks, LLM-driven coding systems have evolved from one-shot code generation into complex systems capable of iterative improvement during inference. However, existing code benchmarks primarily emphasize static correctness and implicitly assume fixed model capability during inference. As a result, they do not capture inference-time self-evolution, such as whether accuracy and efficiency improve as an agent iteratively refines its solutions. They also provide limited accounting of resource costs and rarely calibrate model performance against that of human programmers. Moreover, many benchmarks are dominated by high-resource languages, leaving cross-language robustness and long-tail language stability underexplored. Therefore, we present EvoCodeBench, a benchmark for evaluating self-evolving LLM-driven coding systems across programming languages with direct comparison to human performance. EvoCodeBench tracks performance dynamics, measuring solution correctness alongside efficiency metrics such as solving time, memory consumption, and improvement algorithmic design over repeated problem-solving attempts. To ground evaluation in a human-centered reference frame, we directly compare model performance with that of human programmers on the same tasks, enabling relative performance assessment within the human ability distribution. Furthermore, EvoCodeBench supports multiple programming languages, enabling systematic cross-language and long-tail stability analyses under a unified protocol. Our results demonstrate that self-evolving systems exhibit measurable gains in efficiency over time, and that human-relative and multi-language analyses provide insights unavailable through accuracy alone. EvoCodeBench establishes a foundation for evaluating coding intelligence in evolving LLM-driven systems.</p></details> |  |

We extend GraphCodeBERT with an explicit, low-dimensional behavioral feature that captures observable agreement between code fragments, and fuse this signal with the pooled transformer representation through a trainable output head. We compute behavioral agreement via output comparisons under a fixed test suite and use this observed output agreement as an operational approximation of semantic similarity between code pairs. The resulting feature acts as an explicit behavioral signature that complements token- and graph-based representations. Experiments on established clone detection benchmarks show consistent improvements in precision, recall, and F$_1$ over the unmodified GraphCodeBERT baseline, with the largest gains on semantically equivalent but syntactically dissimilar pairs. The source code that illustrates our approach can be downloaded from https://www.github.com/jorge-martinez-gil/graphcodebert-feature-integration.</p></details> | 16 pages |

In open-source software (OSS) projects, such links play an important role, particularly between the contributions (e.g., GitHub issues) and the corresponding source code. Through these links, developers can trace the discussions in contributions and uncover design rationales, constraints, and security concerns. Previous studies have mainly examined accepted contributions, while those declined after discussion have been overlooked. The discussions behind declined contributions contain valuable design rationales and implicit knowledge about software decision-making, as the reasons behind the decline often reveal the criteria used to judge what should or should not be implemented. In this study, we present the first attempt to establish traceability links between declined contributions and related source code. We propose an initial linking approach and conduct an empirical analysis of the generated links to discuss factors affecting link generation. As our dataset, we use proposals from the official Go repository, which are GitHub issues used to propose new features or language changes. To link declined proposals to source code, we designed an LLM-driven pipeline. Our results showed that the pipeline selected the correct granularity for each declined proposal with an accuracy of 0.836, and generated correct links at that granularity with a mean precision of 0.643. To clarify the challenges of linking declined proposals, we performed a failure analysis. In the declined proposals where the pipeline failed to generate links, the discussions were often redundant and lacked concrete information (e.g., how the feature should be implemented).</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, MSR2026 Technical Track</p></details> |

Recent AI models show promise in vericoding, but a unified methodology for cross-paradigm evaluation is lacking. Existing benchmarks test only individual languages/tools (e.g., Dafny, Verus, and Lean) and each covers very different tasks, so the performance numbers are not directly comparable. We address this gap with AlgoVeri, a benchmark that evaluates vericoding of $77$ classical algorithms in Dafny, Verus, and Lean. By enforcing identical functional contracts, AlgoVeri reveals critical capability gaps in verification systems. While frontier models achieve tractable success in Dafny ($40.3$% for Gemini-3 Flash), where high-level abstractions and SMT automation simplify the workflow, performance collapses under the systems-level memory constraints of Verus ($24.7$%) and the explicit proof construction required by Lean (7.8%). Beyond aggregate metrics, we uncover a sharp divergence in test-time compute dynamics: Gemini-3 effectively utilizes iterative repair to boost performance (e.g., tripling pass rates in Dafny), whereas GPT-OSS saturates early. Finally, our error analysis shows that language design affects the refinement trajectory: while Dafny allows models to focus on logical correctness, Verus and Lean trap models in persistent syntactic and semantic barriers. All data and evaluation code can be found at https://github.com/haoyuzhao123/algoveri.</p></details> | 32 pages |
| **[GraphMend: Code Transformations for Fixing Graph Breaks in PyTorch 2](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16248v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents GRAPHMEND, a high-level compiler technique that eliminates FX graph breaks in PyTorch 2 programs. Although PyTorch 2 introduced TorchDynamo and TorchInductor to enable just-in-time graph compilation, unresolved dynamic control flow and unsupported Python constructs often fragment models into multiple FX graphs. These fragments force frequent fallbacks to eager mode, introduce costly CPU-to-GPU synchronizations, and reduce optimization opportunities. GRAPHMEND addresses this limitation by analyzing and transforming source code before execution. Built on the Jaseci compilation framework, GRAPHMEND introduces two code transformations that remove graph breaks due to dynamic control flow and Python side effects. This design allows PyTorch's compilation pipeline to capture larger, uninterrupted FX graphs without requiring manual refactoring by developers. Evaluation across eight Hugging Face models shows that GRAPHMEND removes graph breaks due to dynamic control flow and Python side effects, reducing the break count to 0 in 6 models and reducing it from 5 to 2 in another model. On NVIDIA RTX 3090 and A40 GPUs, GRAPHMEND achieves up to 75% latency reductions and up to 8% higher end-to-end throughput. These results demonstrate that high-level code transformation is an effective complement to PyTorch's dynamic JIT compilation pipeline, substantially improving both usability and performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Separating Quantum and Classical Advice with Good Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09385v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show an unconditional classical oracle separation between the class of languages that can be verified using a quantum proof ($\mathsf{QMA}$) and the class of languages that can be verified with a classical proof ($\mathsf{QCMA}$). Compared to the recent work of Bostanci, Haferkamp, Nirkhe, and Zhandry (STOC 2026), our proof is conceptually and technically simpler, and readily extends to other oracle separations. In particular, our techniques yield the first unconditional classical oracle separation between the class of languages that can be decided with quantum advice ($\mathsf{BQP}/\mathsf{qpoly}$) and the class of languages that can be decided with classical advice ($\mathsf{BQP}/\mathsf{poly}$), improving on the quantum oracle separation of Aaronson and Kuperberg (CCC 2007) and the classically-accessible classical oracle separation of Li, Liu, Pelecanos and Yamakawa (ITCS 2024). Our oracles are based on the code intersection problem introduced by Yamakawa and Zhandry (FOCS 2022), combined with codes that have extremely good list-recovery properties.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharpen the Spec, Cut the Code: A Case for Generative File System with SYSSPEC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13047v4)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>File systems are critical OS components that require constant evolution to support new hardware and emerging application needs. However, the traditional paradigm of developing features, fixing bugs, and maintaining the system incurs significant overhead, especially as systems grow in complexity. This paper proposes a new paradigm, generative file systems, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and evolve a file system from prompts, effectively addressing the need for robust evolution. Despite the widespread success of LLMs in code generation, attempts to create a functional file system have thus far been unsuccessful, mainly due to the ambiguity of natural language prompts. This paper introduces SYSSPEC, a framework for developing generative file systems. Its key insight is to replace ambiguous natural language with principles adapted from formal methods. Instead of imprecise prompts, SYSSPEC employs a multi-part specification that accurately describes a file system's functionality, modularity, and concurrency. The specification acts as an unambiguous blueprint, guiding LLMs to generate expected code flexibly. To manage evolution, we develop a DAG-structured patch that operates on the specification itself, enabling new features to be added without violating existing invariants. Moreover, the SYSSPEC toolchain features a set of LLM-based agents with mechanisms to mitigate hallucination during construction and evolution. We demonstrate our approach by generating SPECFS, a concurrent file system. SPECFS demonstrates equivalent level of correctness to that of a manually-coded baseline across hundreds of regression tests. We further confirm its evolvability by seamlessly integrating 10 real-world features from Ext4. Our work shows that a specification-guided approach makes generating and evolving complex systems not only feasible but also highly effective.</p></details> |  |

While leading LLMs have demonstrated excellent performance in coding and scientific reasoning tasks, their capacity to advance EDA technology itself has been largely untested. We present AuDoPEDA, an autonomous, repository-grounded coding system built atop OpenAI models and a Codex-class agent that reads OpenROAD, proposes research directions, expands them into implementation steps, and submits executable diffs. Our contributions include (i) a closed-loop LLM framework for EDA code changes; (ii) a task suite and evaluation protocol on OpenROAD for PPA-oriented improvements; and (iii) end-to-end demonstrations with minimal human oversight. Experiments in OpenROAD achieve routed wirelength reductions of up to 5.9%, effective clock period reductions of up to 10.0%, and power reductions of up to 19.4%.</p></details> |  |
| **[AIDev: Studying AI Coding Agents on GitHub](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09185v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI coding agents are rapidly transforming software engineering by performing tasks such as feature development, debugging, and testing. Despite their growing impact, the research community lacks a comprehensive dataset capturing how these agents are used in real-world projects. To address this gap, we introduce AIDev, a large-scale dataset focused on agent-authored pull requests (Agentic-PRs) in real-world GitHub repositories. AIDev aggregates 932,791 Agentic-PRs produced by five agents: OpenAI Codex, Devin, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, and Claude Code. These PRs span 116,211 repositories and involve 72,189 developers. In addition, AIDev includes a curated subset of 33,596 Agentic-PRs from 2,807 repositories with over 100 stars, providing further information such as comments, reviews, commits, and related issues. This dataset offers a foundation for future research on AI adoption, developer productivity, and human-AI collaboration in the new era of software engineering. > AI Agent, Agentic AI, Coding Agent, Agentic Coding, Agentic Software Engineering, Agentic Engineering</p></details> |  |

An Evaluation from Beginner Errors to Security Vulnerabilities in Python and C++](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.16419v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT-4, Claude 3, and LLaMA 4 are increasingly embedded in software/application development, supporting tasks from code generation to debugging. Yet, their real-world effectiveness in detecting diverse software bugs, particularly complex, security-relevant vulnerabilities, remains underexplored. This study presents a systematic, empirical evaluation of these three leading LLMs using a benchmark of foundational programming errors, classic security flaws, and advanced, production-grade bugs in C++ and Python. The dataset integrates real code from SEED Labs, OpenSSL (via the Suresoft GLaDOS database), and PyBugHive, validated through local compilation and testing pipelines. A novel multi-stage, context-aware prompting protocol simulates realistic debugging scenarios, while a graded rubric measures detection accuracy, reasoning depth, and remediation quality. Our results show that all models excel at identifying syntactic and semantic issues in well-scoped code, making them promising for educational use and as first-pass reviewers in automated code auditing. Performance diminishes in scenarios involving complex security vulnerabilities and large-scale production code, with ChatGPT-4 and Claude 3 generally providing more nuanced contextual analyses than LLaMA 4. This highlights both the promise and the present constraints of LLMs in serving as reliable code analysis tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Context-Driven Approach for Co-Auditing Smart Contracts with The Support of GPT-4 code interpreter](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18075v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The surge in the adoption of smart contracts necessitates rigorous auditing to ensure their security and reliability. Manual auditing, although comprehensive, is time-consuming and heavily reliant on the auditor's expertise. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs), there is growing interest in leveraging them to assist auditors in the auditing process (co-auditing). However, the effectiveness of LLMs in smart contract co-auditing is contingent upon the design of the input prompts, especially in terms of context description and code length. This paper introduces a novel context-driven prompting technique for smart contract co-auditing. Our approach employs three techniques for context scoping and augmentation, encompassing code scoping to chunk long code into self-contained code segments based on code inter-dependencies, assessment scoping to enhance context description based on the target assessment goal, thereby limiting the search space, and reporting scoping to force a specific format for the generated response. Through empirical evaluations on publicly available vulnerable contracts, our method demonstrated a detection rate of 96\% for vulnerable functions, outperforming the native prompting approach, which detected only 53\%. To assess the reliability of our prompting approach, manual analysis of the results was conducted by expert auditors from our partner, Quantstamp, a world-leading smart contract auditing company. The experts' analysis indicates that, in unlabeled datasets, our proposed approach enhances the proficiency of the GPT-4 code interpreter in detecting vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Metamorphic Testing Perspective on Knowledge Distillation for Language Models of Code: Does the Student Deeply Mimic the Teacher?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05476v3)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer-based language models of code have achieved state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of software analytics tasks, but their practical deployment remains limited due to high computational costs, slow inference speeds, and significant environmental impact. To address these challenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as a method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a smaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree to which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal representations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current accuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality and often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity between the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically show that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model, resulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks, which is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we propose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically evaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student models under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate MetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular language models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation techniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress identifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring the need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation pipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing compressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is a revised version of a manuscript currently under revision at the Journal of Systems and Software</p></details> |
| **[Clique-Based Deletion-Correcting Codes via Penalty-Guided Clique Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08952v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the construction of $d$-deletion-correcting binary codes by formulating the problem as a Maximum Clique Problem (MCP). In this formulation, vertices represent candidate codewords and edges connect pairs whose longest common subsequence (LCS) distance guarantees correction of up to $d$ deletions. A valid codebook corresponds to a clique in the resulting graph, and finding the largest codebook is equivalent to identifying a maximum clique. While MCP-based formulations for deletion-correcting codes have previously been explored, we demonstrate that applying Penalty-Guided Clique Search (PGCS), a lightweight stochastic clique-search heuristic inspired by Dynamic Local Search (DLS), consistently yields larger codebooks than existing graph-based heuristics, including minimum-degree and coloring methods, for block lengths $n = 8,9,\dots,14$ and deletion parameters $d = 1,2,3$. In several finite-length regimes, the resulting codebooks match known optimal sizes and outperform classical constructions such as Helberg codes. For decoding under segmented reception, where codeword boundaries are known, we propose an optimized LCS-based decoder that exploits symbol-count filtering and early termination to substantially reduce the number of LCS evaluations while preserving exact decoding guarantees. These optimizations lead to significantly lower average-case decoding complexity than the baseline $O(|C| n^2)$ approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comparing AI Coding Agents: A Task-Stratified Analysis of Pull Request Acceptance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08915v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of AI-powered coding assistants is transforming software development practices, yet systematic comparisons of their effectiveness across different task types and over time remain limited. This paper presents an empirical study comparing five popular agents (OpenAI Codex, GitHub Copilot, Devin, Cursor, and Claude Code), analyzing 7,156 pull requests (PRs) from the AIDev dataset. Temporal trend analysis reveals heterogeneous evolution patterns: Devin exhibits the only consistent positive trend in acceptance rate (+0.77% per week over 32 weeks), whereas other agents remain largely stable. Our analysis suggests that the PR task type is a dominant factor influencing acceptance rates: documentation tasks achieve 82.1% acceptance compared to 66.1% for new features - a 16 percentage point gap that exceeds typical inter-agent variance for most tasks. OpenAI Codex achieves consistently high acceptance rates across all nine task categories (59.6%-88.6%), with stratified Chi-square tests confirming statistically significant advantages over other agents in several task categories. However, no single agent performs best across all task types: Claude Code leads in documentation (92.3%) and features (72.6%), while Cursor excels in fix tasks (80.4%).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by MSR'26 Mining Challenge Track</p></details> |

We introduce ProjDevBench, an end-to-end benchmark that provides project requirements to coding agents and evaluates the resulting repositories. Combining Online Judge (OJ) testing with LLM-assisted code review, the benchmark evaluates agents on (1) system architecture design, (2) functional correctness, and (3) iterative solution refinement. We curate 20 programming problems across 8 categories, covering both concept-oriented tasks and real-world application scenarios, and evaluate six coding agents built on different LLM backends. Our evaluation reports an overall acceptance rate of 27.38%: agents handle basic functionality and data structures but struggle with complex system design, time complexity optimization, and resource management. Our benchmark is available at https://github.com/zsworld6/projdevbench.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces Scylla, an evaluation framework for benchmarking agentic coding tools through structured ablation studies that uses seven testing tiers (T0-T6) progressively adding complexity to isolate what directly influences results and how. The key metric is Cost-of-Pass (CoP): the expected dollar cost to get one correct solution, which directly quantifies the trade-off between complexity and efficiency. The framework is model-agnostic, designed to work with any CLI tool; this paper demonstrates it with Claude Sonnet 4.5, using multiple LLM judges (Opus 4.5, Sonnet 4.5, Haiku 4.5) from the same vendor for evaluation consensus, where judges score results using direct tests, human-designed LLM-evaluated rubrics, and qualitative assessment. The result is a reproducible framework that quantifies trade-offs between agent complexity and actual outcomes, suggesting that architectural complexity does not always improve quality.</p></details> | 32 Pages, 7 Figures |
| **[From Token to Line: Enhancing Code Generation with a Long-Term Perspective](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07433v4)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly promoted the development of code generation task, sparking a surge in pertinent literature. Current research is hindered by redundant generation results and a tendency to overfit local patterns in the short term. Although existing studies attempt to alleviate the issue by adopting a multi-token prediction strategy, there remains limited focus on choosing the appropriate processing length for generations. By analyzing the attention between tokens during the generation process of LLMs, it can be observed that the high spikes of the attention scores typically appear at the end of lines. This insight suggests that it is reasonable to treat each line of code as a fundamental processing unit and generate them sequentially. Inspired by this, we propose the LSR-MCTS algorithm, which leverages MCTS to determine the code line-by-line and select the optimal path. Further, we integrate a self-refine mechanism at each node to enhance diversity and generate higher-quality programs through error correction. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analyses on three public coding benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art performance approaches.</p></details> |  |

Our results show that, at a given time instant, the maximum attainable column distance of trellis codes can exceed that of convolutional codes. Moreover, using expander graphs, we construct trellis codes over constant-size alphabets that achieve a rate-distance trade-off arbitrarily close to that of convolutional codes with a maximum distance profile. By comparison, all known constructions of convolutional codes with a maximum distance profile require working over alphabets whose size grows at least exponentially with the number of output symbols per time instant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Quantity: Trajectory Diversity Scaling for Code Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03219v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As code large language models (LLMs) evolve into tool-interactive agents via the Model Context Protocol (MCP), their generalization is increasingly limited by low-quality synthetic data and the diminishing returns of quantity scaling. Moreover, quantity-centric scaling exhibits an early bottleneck that underutilizes trajectory data. We propose TDScaling, a Trajectory Diversity Scaling-based data synthesis framework for code agents that scales performance through diversity rather than raw volume. Under a fixed training budget, increasing trajectory diversity yields larger gains than adding more trajectories, improving the performance-cost trade-off for agent training. TDScaling integrates four innovations: (1) a Business Cluster mechanism that captures real-service logical dependencies; (2) a blueprint-driven multi-agent paradigm that enforces trajectory coherence; (3) an adaptive evolution mechanism that steers synthesis toward long-tail scenarios using Domain Entropy, Reasoning Mode Entropy, and Cumulative Action Complexity to prevent mode collapse; and (4) a sandboxed code tool that mitigates catastrophic forgetting of intrinsic coding capabilities. Experiments on general tool-use benchmarks (BFCL, tau^2-Bench) and code agent tasks (RebenchT, CodeCI, BIRD) demonstrate a win-win outcome: TDScaling improves both tool-use generalization and inherent coding proficiency. We plan to release the full codebase and the synthesized dataset (including 30,000+ tool clusters) upon publication.</p></details> |  |

The cross-file context typically contains different types of information (e.g., relevant APIs and similar code) and is lengthy. In this paper, we found that LLMs struggle to fully utilize the information in the cross-file context. We hypothesize that one of the root causes of the limitation is the misalignment between pre-training (i.e., relying on nearby context) and repo-level code completion (i.e., frequently attending to long-range cross-file context). To address the above misalignment, we propose Code Long-context Alignment - COLA, a purely data-driven approach to explicitly teach LLMs to focus on the cross-file context. Specifically, COLA constructs a large-scale repo-level code completion dataset - COLA-132K, where each sample contains the long cross-file context (up to 128K tokens) and requires generating context-aware code (i.e., cross-file API invocations and code spans similar to cross-file context). Through a two-stage training pipeline upon COLA-132K, LLMs learn the capability of finding relevant information in the cross-file context, thus aligning LLMs with repo-level code completion. We apply COLA to multiple popular LLMs (e.g., aiXcoder-7B) and extensive experiments on COLA-132K and a public benchmark - CrossCodeEval. Our experiments yield the following results. 1) Effectiveness. COLA substantially improves the performance of multiple LLMs in repo-level code completion. For example, it improves aiXcoder-7B by up to 19.7% in exact match. 2) Generalizability. The capability learned by COLA can generalize to new languages. 3) Enhanced Context Utilization Capability. We design two probing experiments, which show COLA improves the capability of LLMs in utilizing the information in cross-file context.</p></details> | <details><summary>Camer...</summary><p>Camera-ready version for ASE2025</p></details> |

These trustless architectures, characterized by their decentralized nature and elimination of third-party intermediaries, have garnered substantial institutional attention. Consequently, the escalating security challenges confronting DApp demand rigorous scholarly investigation. This study initiates with a systematic analysis of behavioral patterns derived from empirical DApp datasets, establishing foundational insights for subsequent methodological developments. The principal security vulnerabilities in Ethereum-based smart contracts developed via Solidity are then critically examined. Specifically, reentrancy vulnerability attacks are addressed by formally representing contract logic using highly expressive code fragments. This enables precise source code-level detection via bidirectional long short-term memory networks with attention mechanisms (BLSTM-ATT). Regarding privacy preservation challenges, contemporary solutions are evaluated through dual analytical lenses: identity privacy preservation and transaction anonymity enhancement, while proposing future research trajectories in cryptographic obfuscation techniques.</p></details> |  |

Oftentimes, developers explicitly document the technical debt in code comments, referred to as Self-Admitted Technical Debt (SATD). Numerous researchers have investigated the impact of SATD on different aspects of software quality and development processes. However, most of these studies focus on SATD in production code, often overlooking SATD in the test code or assuming that it shares similar characteristics with SATD in production code. In fact, a significant amount of SATD is also present in the test code, with many instances not fitting into existing categories for the production code. This study aims to fill this gap and disclose the nature of SATD in the test code by examining its distribution and types. Moreover, the relation between its presence and test quality is also analyzed. Our empirical study, involving 17,766 SATD comments (14,987 from production code, 2,779 from test code) collected from 50 repositories, demonstrates that while SATD widely exists in test code, it is not directly associated with test smells. Our study also presents comprehensive categories of SATD types in the test code, and machine learning models are developed to automatically classify SATD comments based on their types for easier management. Our results show that the CodeBERT-based model outperforms other machine learning models in terms of recall and F1-score. However, the performance varies on different types of SATD.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we empirically study 567 GitHub pull requests (PRs) generated using Claude Code, an agentic coding tool, across 157 diverse open-source projects. Our analysis reveals that developers tend to rely on agents for tasks such as refactoring, documentation, and testing. The results indicate that 83.8% of these agent-assisted PRs are eventually accepted and merged by project maintainers, with 54.9% of the merged PRs are integrated without further modification. The remaining 45.1% require additional changes benefit from human revisions, especially for bug fixes, documentation, and adherence to project-specific standards. These findings suggest that while agent-assisted PRs are largely acceptable, they still benefit from human oversight and refinement.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multipoint Code-Weight Sphere Decoding: Parallel Near-ML Decoding for Short-Blocklength Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08501v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) operate with short packets, where finite-blocklength effects make near-maximum-likelihood (near-ML) decoding desirable but often too costly. This paper proposes a two-stage near-ML decoding framework that applies to any linear block code. In the first stage, we run a low-complexity decoder to produce a candidate codeword and a cyclic redundancy check. When this stage succeeds, we terminate immediately. When it fails, we invoke a second-stage decoder, termed multipoint code-weight sphere decoding (MP-WSD). The central idea behind {MP-WSD} is to concentrate the ML search where it matters. We pre-compute a set of low-weight codewords and use them to generate structured local perturbations of the current estimate. Starting from the first-stage output, MP-WSD iteratively explores a small Euclidean sphere of candidate codewords formed by adding selected low-weight codewords, tightening the search region as better candidates are found. This design keeps the average complexity low: at high signal-to-noise ratio, the first stage succeeds with high probability and the second stage is rarely activated; when it is activated, the search remains localized. Simulation results show that the proposed decoder attains near-ML performance for short-blocklength, low-rate codes while maintaining low decoding latency.</p></details> | 6 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Hierarchical Subcode Ensemble Decoding of Polar Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08391v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Subcode-ensemble decoders improve iterative decoding by running multiple decoders in parallel over carefully chosen subcodes, increasing the likelihood that at least one decoder avoids the dominant trapping structures. Achieving strong diversity gains, however, requires constructing many subcodes that satisfy a linear covering property-yet existing approaches lack a systematic way to scale the ensemble size while preserving this property. This paper introduces hierarchical subcode ensemble decoding (HSCED), a new ensemble decoding framework that expands the number of constituent decoders while still guaranteeing linear covering. The key idea is to recursively generate subcode parity constraints in a hierarchical structure so that coverage is maintained at every level, enabling large ensembles with controlled complexity. To demonstrate its effectiveness, we apply HSCED to belief propagation (BP) decoding of polar codes, where dense parity-check matrices induce severe stopping-set effects that limit conventional BP. Simulations confirm that HSCED delivers significant block-error-rate improvements over standard BP and conventional subcode-ensemble decoding under the same decoding-latency constraint.</p></details> | 5 pages, 7 figures |

While recent advances have utilized foundation models to programmatically generate diverse environments, these approaches often focus on discovering isolated behaviors rather than orchestrating sustained progression. In complex open-ended worlds, the large combinatorial space of possible challenges makes it difficult for agents to discover sequences of experiences that remain consistently learnable. To address this, we propose Dreaming in Code (DiCode), a framework in which foundation models synthesize executable environment code to scaffold learning toward increasing competence. In DiCode, "dreaming" takes the form of materializing code-level variations of the world. We instantiate DiCode in Craftax, a challenging open-ended benchmark characterized by rich mechanics and long-horizon progression. Empirically, DiCode enables agents to acquire long-horizon skills, achieving a $16\%$ improvement in mean return over the strongest baseline and non-zero success on late-game combat tasks where prior methods fail. Our results suggest that code-level environment design provides a practical mechanism for curriculum control, enabling the construction of intermediate environments that bridge competence gaps in open-ended worlds.

| **[Evasion of IoT Malware Detection via Dummy Code Injection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08170v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Internet of Things (IoT) has revolutionized connectivity by linking billions of devices worldwide. However, this rapid expansion has also introduced severe security vulnerabilities, making IoT devices attractive targets for malware such as the Mirai botnet. Power side-channel analysis has recently emerged as a promising technique for detecting malware activity based on device power consumption patterns. However, the resilience of such detection systems under adversarial manipulation remains underexplored. This work presents a novel adversarial strategy against power side-channel-based malware detection. By injecting structured dummy code into the scanning phase of the Mirai botnet, we dynamically perturb power signatures to evade AI/ML-based anomaly detection without disrupting core functionality. Our approach systematically analyzes the trade-offs between stealthiness, execution overhead, and evasion effectiveness across multiple state-of-the-art models for side-channel analysis, using a custom dataset collected from smartphones of diverse manufacturers. Experimental results show that our adversarial modifications achieve an average attack success rate of 75.2\%, revealing practical vulnerabilities in power-based intrusion detection frameworks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Code Metrics into Automated Documentation Generation for Computational Notebooks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08133v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective code documentation is essential for collaboration, comprehension, and long-term software maintainability, yet developers often neglect it due to its repetitive nature. Automated documentation generation has evolved from heuristic and rule-based methods to neural network-based and large language model (LLM)-based approaches. However, existing methods often overlook structural and quantitative characteristics of code that influence readability and comprehension. Prior research suggests that code metrics capture information relevant to program understanding. Building on these insights, this paper investigates the role of source code metrics as auxiliary signals for automated documentation generation, focusing on computational notebooks, a popular medium among data scientists that integrates code, narrative, and results but suffers from inconsistent documentation. We propose a two-stage approach. First, the CodeSearchNet dataset construction process was refined to create a specialized dataset from over 17 million code and markdown cells. After structural and semantic filtering, approximately 36,734 high-quality (code, markdown) pairs were extracted. Second, two modeling paradigms, a lightweight CNN-RNN architecture and a few-shot GPT-3.5 architecture, were evaluated with and without metric information. Results show that incorporating code metrics improves the accuracy and contextual relevance of generated documentation, yielding gains of 6% in BLEU-1 and 3% in ROUGE-L F1 for CNN-RNN-based architecture, and 9% in BERTScore F1 for LLM-based architecture. These findings demonstrate that integrating code metrics provides valuable structural context, enhancing automated documentation generation across diverse model families.</p></details> |  |

We then focus on dispersion, the special case in which the system defines a term map $Θ^\mathcal I:\A^k\to\A^r$ and the objective is the size of its image. Writing $n:=|\A|$, we show that the maximum dispersion is $Θ(n^D)$ for an integer exponent $D$ equal to the guessing number of an associated directed graph, and we give a polynomial-time algorithm to compute $D$. In contrast, deciding whether \emph{perfect dispersion} ever occurs (i.e.\ whether $\Disp_n(\mathbf t)=n^r$ for some finite $n\ge 2$) is undecidable once $r\ge 3$, even though the corresponding asymptotic rate-threshold questions are polynomial-time decidable.</p></details> |  |

Through systematic analysis of programming language token representations, we characterize how programming languages are encoded in LLM tokenizers by analyzing their vocabulary distribution and keyword coverage patterns. We introduce a novel cold-start probability analysis method that provides insights into model behavior without requiring explicit prompts. Additionally, we present a comprehensive evaluation of how different model optimization techniques - including quantization, distillation, model scaling, and task-specific fine-tuning - affect token-level representations and code generation quality. Our experiments, supported by comprehensive probability distribution analysis and evaluation metrics, reveal critical insights into token-level behavior and provide empirically-validated guidelines for maintaining code generation quality under various optimization constraints. These findings advance both theoretical understanding of LLM code generation and practical implementation of optimized models in production environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 1 figure and 6 tables</p></details> |

This paper presents a large-scale ArkTS dataset constructed from open-source repositories, targeting code retrieval and code evaluation tasks. We design a single-search task, where natural language comments are used to retrieve corresponding ArkTS functions. ArkTS repositories are crawled from GitHub and Gitee, and comment-function pairs are extracted using tree-sitter-arkts, followed by cross-platform deduplication and statistical analysis of ArkTS function types. We further evaluate existing open-source code embedding models on the single-search task and perform fine-tuning using both ArkTS and TypeScript training datasets, resulting in a high-performing model for ArkTS code understanding. This work establishes the first systematic benchmark for ArkTS code retrieval. Both the dataset and our fine-tuned model are available at https://huggingface.co/hreyulog/embedinggemma_arkts and https://huggingface.co/datasets/hreyulog/arkts-code-docstring .</p></details> |  |

In the past few years, awareness of benchmark quality has grown. Yet, after a decade-scale (2014-2025) survey over 572 code benchmarks, we observed a lag between growing awareness and actual practice. For example, in 2025 alone, the number of benchmarks that ignore code coverage when providing test cases nearly matches the total count accumulated across the previous ten years. In response, we take a clear position: Code benchmarks must prioritize rigor in benchmark construction, reliability in evaluation, and reproducibility in release. To operationalize this position, we introduce a code benchmark guideline HOW2BENCH with 55 checklists. Finally, our further human study also exposed that the current issues not only stem from the significant effort required, but also from a lack of awareness regarding their importance.</p></details> | 65 pages |

Previous methods rely on the assumption that watermarking high-entropy tokens effectively maintains output quality. Our analysis reveals a fundamental limitation of this assumption: syntax-critical tokens such as keywords often exhibit the highest entropy, making existing approaches vulnerable to logic corruption. We present STONE, a syntax-aware watermarking method that embeds watermarks only in non-syntactic tokens and preserves code integrity. For rigorous evaluation, we also introduce STEM, a comprehensive metric that balances three critical dimensions: correctness, detectability, and imperceptibility. Across Python, C++, and Java, STONE preserves correctness, sustains strong detectability, and achieves balanced performance with minimal computational overhead. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/inistory/STONE-watermarking.</p></details> | <details><summary>Findi...</summary><p>Findings of EACL 2026</p></details> |

We present Rich-ARQ, a paradigm that introduces neural-coded feedback for collaborative physical-layer channel coding between transmitter and receiver. To realize this vision in practice, we develop a novel asynchronous feedback code that eliminates stalling from feedback delays, adapts dynamically to channel fluctuations, and features a lightweight encoder suitable for on-device deployment. We materialize this concept into the first full-stack, standard-compliant software-defined radio prototype, which decouples AI inference from strict radio timing. Comprehensive over-the-air experiments demonstrate that Rich-ARQ achieves significant SNR gains over conventional 1-bit hybrid ARQ and remarkable latency reduction over prior learning-based feedback codes, moving the promise of intelligent feedback from theory to a practical, high-performance reality for next-generation networks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Code Complexity Through the Lens of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07882v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code complexity metrics such as cyclomatic complexity have long been used to assess software quality and maintainability. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) on code understanding and generation tasks, an important yet underexplored question arises: do these traditional complexity metrics meaningfully characterize the difficulty LLMs experience when processing code? In this work, we empirically demonstrate that, after controlling for code length, classical metrics exhibit no consistent correlation with LLM performance, revealing a fundamental mismatch with model-perceived difficulty. To address this gap, we propose LM-CC, a novel code complexity metric designed from the perspective of LLMs. The core premise of LM-CC is that LLM-perceived difficulty is driven by the nonlinearity of program semantics. Accordingly, we decompose programs into semantic units based on entropy, organize these units into a compositional hierarchy, and quantify complexity as a principled aggregation of compositional level and branching-induced divergence, capturing cumulative model uncertainty during code processing. Our extensive experiments show that LM-CC not only correlates more strongly with LLM performance than traditional metrics but also that lowering it directly enhances task performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Variable-Length Feedback Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07881v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning has enabled significant advances in feedback-based channel coding, yet existing learned schemes remain fundamentally limited: they employ fixed block lengths, suffer degraded performance at high rates, and cannot fully exploit the adaptive potential of feedback. This paper introduces Deep Variable-Length Feedback (DeepVLF) coding, a flexible coding framework that dynamically adjusts transmission length via learned feedback. We propose two complementary architectures: DeepVLF-R, where termination is receiver-driven, and DeepVLF-T, where the transmitter controls termination. Both architectures leverage bit-group partitioning and transformer-based encoder-decoder networks to enable fine-grained rate adaptation in response to feedback. Evaluations over AWGN and 5G-NR fading channels demonstrate that DeepVLF substantially outperforms state-of-the-art learned feedback codes. It achieves the same block error rate with 20%-55% fewer channel uses and lowers error floors by orders of magnitude, particularly in high-rate regimes. Encoding dynamics analysis further reveals that the models autonomously learn a two-phase strategy analogous to classical Schalkwijk-Kailath coding: an initial information-carrying phase followed by a noise-cancellation refinement phase. This emergent behavior underscores the interpretability and information-theoretic alignment of the learned codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-Preserving Coding Schemes for Multi-Access Distributed Computing Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07850v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed computing frameworks such as MapReduce have become essential for large-scale data processing by decomposing tasks across multiple nodes. The multi-access distributed computing (MADC) model further advances this paradigm by decoupling mapper and reducer roles: dedicated mapper nodes store data and compute intermediate values, while reducer nodes are connected to multiple mappers and aggregate results to compute final outputs. This separation reduces communication bottlenecks without requiring file replication. In this paper, we introduce privacy constraints into MADC and develop private coded schemes for two specific connectivity models. We construct new families of extended placement delivery arrays and derive corresponding coding schemes that guarantee privacy of each reducer's assigned function.</p></details> |  |
| **[MARTI-MARS$^2$: Scaling Multi-Agent Self-Search via Reinforcement Learning for Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07848v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While the complex reasoning capability of Large Language Models (LLMs) has attracted significant attention, single-agent systems often encounter inherent performance ceilings in complex tasks such as code generation. Multi-agent collaboration offers a promising avenue to transcend these boundaries. However, existing frameworks typically rely on prompt-based test-time interactions or multi-role configurations trained with homogeneous parameters, limiting error correction capabilities and strategic diversity. In this paper, we propose a Multi-Agent Reinforced Training and Inference Framework with Self-Search Scaling (MARTI-MARS2), which integrates policy learning with multi-agent tree search by formulating the multi-agent collaborative exploration process as a dynamic and learnable environment. By allowing agents to iteratively explore and refine within the environment, the framework facilitates evolution from parameter-sharing homogeneous multi-role training to heterogeneous multi-agent training, breaking through single-agent capability limits. We also introduce an efficient inference strategy MARTI-MARS2-T+ to fully exploit the scaling potential of multi-agent collaboration at test time. We conduct extensive experiments across varied model scales (8B, 14B, and 32B) on challenging code generation benchmarks. Utilizing two collaborating 32B models, MARTI-MARS2 achieves 77.7%, outperforming strong baselines like GPT-5.1. Furthermore, MARTI-MARS2 reveals a novel scaling law: shifting from single-agent to homogeneous multi-role and ultimately to heterogeneous multi-agent paradigms progressively yields higher RL performance ceilings, robust TTS capabilities, and greater policy diversity, suggesting that policy diversity is critical for scaling intelligence via multi-agent reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |

Automated Linter Configuration via DSL-Based LLM Compilation of Coding Standards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07783v1)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coding standards are essential for maintaining consistent and high-quality code across teams and projects. Linters help developers enforce these standards by detecting code violations. However, manual linter configuration is complex and expertise-intensive, and the diversity and evolution of programming languages, coding standards, and linters lead to repetitive and maintenance-intensive configuration work. To reduce manual effort, we propose LintCFG, a domain-specific language (DSL)-driven, LLM-based compilation approach to automate linter configuration generation for coding standards, independent of programming languages, coding standards, and linters. Inspired by compiler design, we first design a DSL to express coding rules in a tool-agnostic, structured, readable, and precise manner. Then, we build linter configurations into DSL configuration instructions. For a given natural language coding standard, the compilation process parses it into DSL coding standards, matches them with the DSL configuration instructions to set configuration names, option names and values, verifies consistency between the standards and configurations, and finally generates linter-specific configurations. Experiments with Checkstyle for Java coding standard show that our approach achieves over 90% precision and recall in DSL representation, with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-scores close to 70% (with some exceeding 70%) in fine-grained linter configuration generation. Notably, our approach outperforms baselines by over 100% in precision. A user study further shows that our approach improves developers' efficiency in configuring linters for coding standards. Finally, we demonstrate the generality of the approach by generating ESLint configurations for JavaScript coding standards, showcasing its broad applicability across other programming languages, coding standards, and linters.</p></details> | Accepted By FSE2026 |
| **[GrepRAG: An Empirical Study and Optimization of Grep-Like Retrieval for Code Completion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23254v2)** | 2026-02-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repository-level code completion remains challenging for large language models (LLMs) due to cross-file dependencies and limited context windows. Prior work addresses this challenge using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) frameworks based on semantic indexing or structure-aware graph analysis, but these approaches incur substantial computational overhead for index construction and maintenance. Motivated by common developer workflows that rely on lightweight search utilities (e.g., ripgrep), we revisit a fundamental yet underexplored question: how far can simple, index-free lexical retrieval support repository-level code completion before more complex retrieval mechanisms become necessary? To answer this question, we systematically investigate lightweight, index-free, intent-aware lexical retrieval through extensive empirical analysis. We first introduce Naive GrepRAG, a baseline framework in which LLMs autonomously generate ripgrep commands to retrieve relevant context. Despite its simplicity, Naive GrepRAG achieves performance comparable to sophisticated graph-based baselines. Further analysis shows that its effectiveness stems from retrieving lexically precise code fragments that are spatially closer to the completion site. We also identify key limitations of lexical retrieval, including sensitivity to noisy matches from high-frequency ambiguous keywords and context fragmentation caused by rigid truncation boundaries. To address these issues, we propose GrepRAG, which augments lexical retrieval with a lightweight post-processing pipeline featuring identifier-weighted re-ranking and structure-aware deduplication. Extensive evaluation on CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated demonstrates that GrepRAG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods, achieving 7.04-15.58 percent relative improvement in code exact match (EM) over the best baseline on CrossCodeEval.</p></details> | Under Review |

Nevertheless, current inverse graphics methods face tremendous challenges in accurately reconstructing complex geometric details, which often results in the loss of key geometric constraints or structural distortion. To address this bottleneck, we propose Geo-coder -- the first inverse programming framework for geometric images based on a multi-agent system. Our method innovatively decouples the process into geometric modeling via pixel-wise anchoring and metric-driven code evolution: Stage 1 leverages the complementary advantages of visual operators and large models to achieve precise capture of pixel coordinates and visual attributes; Stage 2 introduces a synthesis-rendering-validation closed loop, where bidirectional visual feedback drives the self-correction of code. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Geo-coder achieves a substantial lead in both geometric reconstruction accuracy and visual consistency. Notably, by effectively preserving the core geometric semantics, the images reconstructed with our method exhibit equivalent performance to the original ones in multimodal reasoning tasks, which fully validates the robustness of the framework. Finally, to further reduce research costs, we have open-sourced the Geo-coder dataset constructed on the GeoCode framework, which contains more than 1,500 samples. On this basis, we have also open-sourced the GeocodeLM model, laying a solid data and model foundation for subsequent research in this field.</p></details> | ICML2026 |

However, their non-linear, event-driven dynamics pose significant challenges for training, and existing methods often deviate from neuroscientific principles of cortical learning. Drawing inspiration from predictive coding theory-a leading model of brain information processing-we propose PC-SNN, a novel learning framework that integrates predictive coding with SNNs to enable biologically plausible, local Hebbian plasticity without reliance on backpropagation. Unlike conventional SNN training approaches, PC-SNN leverages only local computations, aligning with the brain's distributed processing and overcoming the biological implausibility of global error propagation. Our classification model achieves competitive performance on the benchmark datasets, including Caltech Face/Motorbike, MNIST, and CIFAR10, surpassing state-of-the-art multi-layer SNNs. Furthermore, our predictive coding-based regression model outperforms backpropagation-based methods while adhering to local plasticity constraints, offering a scalable and biologically grounded alternative for SNN training. PC-SNN drives progress in neuromorphic computing through validating the adaptability of bio-inspired algorithms within spiking neural architectures, but also unveils novel understandings of neurocognitive learning processes, presenting a conceptual framework distinguished by its theoretical originality and functional efficacy.</p></details> |  |

| **[On the Infinite Width and Depth Limits of Predictive Coding Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07697v1)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive coding (PC) is a biologically plausible alternative to standard backpropagation (BP) that minimises an energy function with respect to network activities before updating weights. Recent work has improved the training stability of deep PC networks (PCNs) by leveraging some BP-inspired reparameterisations. However, the full scalability and theoretical basis of these approaches remains unclear. To address this, we study the infinite width and depth limits of PCNs. For linear residual networks, we show that the set of width- and depth-stable feature-learning parameterisations for PC is exactly the same as for BP. Moreover, under any of these parameterisations, the PC energy with equilibrated activities converges to the BP loss in a regime where the model width is much larger than the depth, resulting in PC computing the same gradients as BP. Experiments show that these results hold in practice for deep nonlinear networks, as long as an activity equilibrium seem to be reached. Overall, this work unifies various previous theoretical and empirical results and has potentially important implications for the scaling of PCNs.</p></details> | 31 pages, 27 figures |
| **[Towards an Understanding of Context Utilization in Code Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08734v2)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code intelligence is an emerging domain in software engineering, aiming to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of various code-related tasks. Recent research suggests that incorporating contextual information beyond the basic original task inputs (i.e., source code) can substantially enhance model performance. Such contextual signals may be obtained directly or indirectly from sources such as API documentation or intermediate representations like abstract syntax trees can significantly improve the effectiveness of code intelligence. Despite growing academic interest, there is a lack of systematic analysis of context in code intelligence. To address this gap, we conduct an extensive literature review of 146 relevant studies published between September 2007 and August 2024. Our investigation yields four main contributions. (1) A quantitative analysis of the research landscape, including publication trends, venues, and the explored domains; (2) A novel taxonomy of context types used in code intelligence; (3) A task-oriented analysis investigating context integration strategies across diverse code intelligence tasks; (4) A critical evaluation of evaluation methodologies for context-aware methods. Based on these findings, we identify fundamental challenges in context utilization in current code intelligence systems and propose a research roadmap that outlines key opportunities for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Computing Surveys</p></details> |

This execution-based world modeling enables internal verification within the model, offering an alternative to natural language chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the sources of errors and the nature of CWMs' limitations remain poorly understood. We study CWMs from two complementary perspectives: local semantic execution and long-horizon state tracking. On real-code benchmarks, we identify two dominant failure regimes. First, dense runtime state reveals produce token-intensive execution traces, leading to token-budget exhaustion on programs with long execution histories. Second, failures disproportionately concentrate in string-valued state, which we attribute to limitations of subword tokenization rather than program structure. To study long-horizon behavior, we use a controlled permutation-tracking benchmark that isolates state propagation under action execution. We show that long-horizon degradation is driven primarily by incorrect action generation: when actions are replaced with ground-truth commands, a Transformer-based CWM propagates state accurately over long horizons, despite known limitations of Transformers in long-horizon state tracking. These findings suggest directions for more efficient supervision and state representations in CWMs that are better aligned with program execution and data types.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, under review in conference</p></details> |
| **[Data Compression with Stochastic Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07635v1)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning has had a major impact on data compression over the last decade and inspired many new, exciting theoretical and applied questions. This paper describes one such direction -- relative entropy coding -- which focuses on constructing stochastic codes, primarily as an alternative to quantisation and entropy coding in lossy source coding. Our primary aim is to provide a broad overview of the topic, with an emphasis on the computational and practical aspects currently missing from the literature. Our goal is threefold: for the curious reader, we aim to provide an intuitive picture of the field and convince them that relative entropy coding is a simple yet exciting emerging field in data compression research. For a reader interested in applied research on lossy data compression, we provide an account of the most salient contemporary applications. Finally, for the reader who has heard of relative entropy coding but has never been quite sure what it is or how the algorithms fit together, we hope to illustrate how simple and elegant the underlying constructions are.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data Compression with Relative Entropy Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16309v3)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the last few years, machine learning unlocked previously infeasible features for compression, such as providing guarantees for users' privacy or tailoring compression to specific data statistics (e.g., satellite images or audio recordings of animals) or users' audiovisual perception. This, in turn, has led to an explosion of theoretical investigations and insights that aim to develop new fundamental theories, methods and algorithms better suited for machine learning-based compressors. In this thesis, I contribute to this trend by investigating relative entropy coding, a mathematical framework that generalises classical source coding theory. Concretely, relative entropy coding deals with the efficient communication of uncertain or randomised information. One of its key advantages is that it extends compression methods to continuous spaces and can thus be integrated more seamlessly into modern machine learning pipelines than classical quantisation-based approaches. Furthermore, it is a natural foundation for developing advanced compression methods that are privacy-preserving or account for the perceptual quality of the reconstructed data. The thesis considers relative entropy coding at three conceptual levels: After introducing the basics of the framework, (1) I prove results that provide new, maximally tight fundamental limits to the communication and computational efficiency of relative entropy coding; (2) I use the theory of Poisson point processes to develop and analyse new relative entropy coding algorithms, whose performance attains the theoretic optima and (3) I showcase the strong practical performance of relative entropy coding by applying it to image, audio, video and protein data compression using small, energy-efficient, probabilistic neural networks called Bayesian implicit neural representations.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD T...</summary><p>PhD Thesis. 224 pages, 19 figures</p></details> |

To date, the individual importance of these intermediate outputs to the system correctness remains opaque, which impedes targeted optimization of MACGS designs. To address this challenge, we propose CAM, the first \textbf{C}ausality-based \textbf{A}nalysis framework for \textbf{M}ACGS that systematically quantifies the contribution of different intermediate features for system correctness. By comprehensively categorizing intermediate outputs and systematically simulating realistic errors on intermediate features, we identify the important features for system correctness and aggregate their importance rankings. We conduct extensive empirical analysis on the identified importance rankings. Our analysis reveals intriguing findings: first, we uncover context-dependent features\textemdash features whose importance emerges mainly through interactions with other features, revealing that quality assurance for MACGS should incorporate cross-feature consistency checks; second, we reveal that hybrid backend MACGS with different backend LLMs assigned according to their relative strength achieves up to 7.2\% Pass@1 improvement, underscoring hybrid architectures as a promising direction for future MACGS design. We further demonstrate CAM's practical utility through two applications: (1) failure repair which achieves a 73.3\% success rate by optimizing top-3 importance-ranked features and (2) feature pruning that reduces up to 66.8\% intermediate token consumption while maintaining generation performance. Our work provides actionable insights for MACGS design and deployment, establishing causality analysis as a powerful approach for understanding and improving MACGS.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 12 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[Pull Requests as a Training Signal for Repo-Level Code Editing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07457v1)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repository-level code editing requires models to understand complex dependencies and execute precise multi-file modifications across a large codebase. While recent gains on SWE-bench rely heavily on complex agent scaffolding, it remains unclear how much of this capability can be internalised via high-quality training signals. To address this, we propose Clean Pull Request (Clean-PR), a mid-training paradigm that leverages real-world GitHub pull requests as a training signal for repository-level editing. We introduce a scalable pipeline that converts noisy pull request diffs into Search/Replace edit blocks through reconstruction and validation, resulting in the largest publicly available corpus of 2 million pull requests spanning 12 programming languages. Using this training signal, we perform a mid-training stage followed by an agentless-aligned supervised fine-tuning process with error-driven data augmentation. On SWE-bench, our model significantly outperforms the instruction-tuned baseline, achieving absolute improvements of 13.6% on SWE-bench Lite and 12.3% on SWE-bench Verified. These results demonstrate that repository-level code understanding and editing capabilities can be effectively internalised into model weights under a simplified, agentless protocol, without relying on heavy inference-time scaffolding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Secure Code Generation via Online Reinforcement Learning with Vulnerability Reward Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07422v1)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software development, yet their tendency to generate insecure code remains a major barrier to real-world deployment. Existing secure code alignment methods often suffer from a functionality--security paradox, improving security at the cost of substantial utility degradation. We propose SecCoderX, an online reinforcement learning framework for functionality-preserving secure code generation. SecCoderX first bridges vulnerability detection and secure code generation by repurposing mature detection resources in two ways: (i) synthesizing diverse, reality-grounded vulnerability-inducing coding tasks for online RL rollouts, and (ii) training a reasoning-based vulnerability reward model that provides scalable and reliable security supervision. Together, these components are unified in an online RL loop to align code LLMs to generate secure and functional code. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SecCoderX achieves state-of-the-art performance, improving Effective Safety Rate (ESR) by approximately 10% over unaligned models, whereas prior methods often degrade ESR by 14-54%. We release our code, dataset and model checkpoints at https://github.com/AndrewWTY/SecCoderX.</p></details> |  |

However, current SAEs are trained per modality, producing dictionaries whose features are not directly understandable and whose explanations do not transfer across domains. In this study, we introduce LUCID (Learning Unified vision-language sparse Codes for Interpretable concept Discovery), a unified vision-language sparse autoencoder that learns a shared latent dictionary for image patch and text token representations, while reserving private capacity for modality-specific details. We achieve feature alignment by coupling the shared codes with a learned optimal transport matching objective without the need of labeling. LUCID yields interpretable shared features that support patch-level grounding, establish cross-modal neuron correspondence, and enhance robustness against the concept clustering problem in similarity-based evaluation. Leveraging the alignment properties, we develop an automated dictionary interpretation pipeline based on term clustering without manual observations. Our analysis reveals that LUCID's shared features capture diverse semantic categories beyond objects, including actions, attributes, and abstract concepts, demonstrating a comprehensive approach to interpretable multimodal representations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Code Localization with Repository Memory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01003v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code localization is a fundamental challenge in repository-level software engineering tasks such as bug fixing. While existing methods equip language agents with comprehensive tools/interfaces to fetch information from the repository, they overlook the critical aspect of memory, where each instance is typically handled from scratch assuming no prior repository knowledge. In contrast, human developers naturally build long-term repository memory, such as the functionality of key modules and associations between various bug types and their likely fix locations. In this work, we augment language agents with such memory by leveraging a repository's commit history -- a rich yet underutilized resource that chronicles the codebase's evolution. We introduce tools that allow the agent to retrieve from a non-parametric memory encompassing recent historical commits and linked issues, as well as functionality summaries of actively evolving parts of the codebase identified via commit patterns. We demonstrate that augmenting such a memory can significantly improve LocAgent, a state-of-the-art localization framework, on both SWE-bench-verified and the more recent SWE-bench-live benchmarks. Our research contributes towards developing agents that can accumulate and leverage past experience for long-horizon tasks, more closely emulating the expertise of human developers.</p></details> | ICLR 2026 |
| **[Vibe Coding for Product Design: Understanding Product Team Members' Perceptions of AI-Assisted Design and Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10652v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI is reshaping product design practices through "vibe coding", where product team members express intent in natural language and AI translates it into functional prototypes and code. Despite rapid adoption, little research has examined how vibe coding reconfigures product development workflows and collaboration. Drawing on interviews with 22 product team members across enterprises, startups, and academia, we show how vibe coding follows a four-stage workflow of ideation, generation, debugging, and review. This accelerates iteration, supports creativity, and lowers participation barriers. However, participants reported challenges of code unreliability, integration, and AI over-reliance. We find tensions between efficiency-driven prototyping ("intending the right design") and reflection ("designing the right intention"), introducing new asymmetries in trust, responsibility, and social stigma within teams. Through a responsible human-AI collaboration lens for AI-assisted product design and development, we contribute a deeper understanding of deskilling, ownership and disclosure, and creativity safeguarding in the age of vibe coding.</p></details> |  |
| **[code_transformed: The Influence of Large Language Models on Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12014v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coding remains one of the most fundamental modes of interaction between humans and machines. With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability, and similarity. By analyzing code from over 20,000 GitHub repositories linked to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake_case function names in Python code increased from 40.7% in Q1 2023 to 49.8% in Q3 2025. Furthermore, we investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning processes. Our experimental results may provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world programming style. We release all the experimental dataset and source code at: https://github.com/ignorancex/LLM_code</p></details> | EACL 2026 Findings |
| **[TraceCoder: A Trace-Driven Multi-Agent Framework for Automated Debugging of LLM-Generated Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06875v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often generate code with subtle but critical bugs, especially for complex tasks. Existing automated repair methods typically rely on superficial pass/fail signals, offering limited visibility into program behavior and hindering precise error localization. In addition, without a way to learn from prior failures, repair processes often fall into repetitive and inefficient cycles. To overcome these challenges, we present TraceCoder, a collaborative multi-agent framework that emulates the observe-analyze-repair process of human experts. The framework first instruments the code with diagnostic probes to capture fine-grained runtime traces, enabling deep insight into its internal execution. It then conducts causal analysis on these traces to accurately identify the root cause of the failure. This process is further enhanced by a novel Historical Lesson Learning Mechanism (HLLM), which distills insights from prior failed repair attempts to inform subsequent correction strategies and prevent recurrence of similar mistakes. To ensure stable convergence, a Rollback Mechanism enforces that each repair iteration constitutes a strict improvement toward the correct solution. Comprehensive experiments across multiple benchmarks show that TraceCoder achieves up to a 34.43\% relative improvement in Pass@1 accuracy over existing advanced baselines. Ablation studies verify the significance of each system component, with the iterative repair process alone contributing a 65.61\% relative gain in accuracy. Furthermore, TraceCoder significantly outperforms leading iterative methods in terms of both accuracy and cost-efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Understanding What State Space Models Learn About Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06774v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State Space Models (SSMs) have emerged as an efficient alternative to the transformer architecture. Recent studies show that SSMs can match or surpass Transformers on code understanding tasks, such as code retrieval, when trained under similar conditions. However, their internal mechanisms remain a black box. We present the first systematic analysis of what SSM-based code models actually learn and perform the first comparative analysis of SSM and Transformer-based code models. Our analysis reveals that SSMs outperform Transformers at capturing code syntax and semantics in pretraining but forgets certain syntactic and semantic relations during fine-tuning on task, especially when the task emphasizes short-range dependencies. To diagnose this, we introduce SSM-Interpret, a frequency-domain framework that exposes a spectral shift toward short-range dependencies during fine-tuning. Guided by these findings, we propose architectural modifications that significantly improve the performance of SSM-based code model, validating that our analysis directly enables better models.</p></details> |  |

Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs), as opposed to source code, have been shown to improve summarization quality in traditional encoder-decoder-based code summarization models. However, most large language model (LLM)-based code summarization methods rely on raw code or only incorporate partial AST signals, meaning that the potential of complete AST representation has not been fully explored for LLMs. This paper presents AST(NIT), an AST augmentation and serialization method that preserves lexical details and encodes structural information into LLM-compatible sequences. Experiments with the LLaMA-3.1-8B model on the CodeXGLUE Python dataset show that the proposed serialized ASTs reduce the length of LLM inputs, require shorter training times, and achieve summarization quality comparable to existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 3rd International Workshop on Large Language Models for Code (LLM4Code 2026), co-located with ICSE 2026</p></details> |
| **[Codes for Metastability-Containing Addition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06467v1)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the fundamental task of addition under uncertainty, namely, addends that are represented as intervals of numbers rather than single values. One potential source of such uncertainty can occur when obtaining discrete-valued measurements of analog values, which are prone to metastability. Naturally, unstable bits impact gate-level and, consequently, circuit-level computations. Using Binary encoding for such an addition produces a sum with an amplified imprecision. Hence, the challenge is to devise an encoding that does not amplify the imprecision caused by unstable bits. We call such codes recoverable. While this challenge is easily met for unary encoding, no suitable codes of high rates are known. In this work, we prove an upper bound on the rate of preserving and recoverable codes for a given bound on the addends' combined uncertainty. We then design an asymptotically optimal code that preserves the addends' combined uncertainty. We then discuss how to obtain adders for our code. The approach can be used with any known or future construction for containing metastability of the inputs. We conjecture that careful design based on existing techniques can lead to significant latency reduction.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication at IEEE Transactions on Computers</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Guarantee Type Correctness in Code Generation through Type-Guided Program Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10216v2)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models have shown remarkable proficiency in code generation; nevertheless, ensuring type correctness remains a challenge. Although traditional methods, such as constrained decoding, alleviate this problem by externally rejecting untypable code, the model itself does not effectively learn type reasoning internally, which ultimately limits its overall performance. This paper introduces TyFlow, a novel system that internalizes type reasoning within code generation to guide the model to learn the type system. The core of our approach is a novel type-guided program synthesis system that maintains an isomorphism between type derivation trees and synthesis derivation trees, enabling a new code representation based on synthesis decision sequences rather than traditional text-based token sequences. By offloading the complexity of type system learning to the representation itself, models can redirect their computational resources toward higher-level program semantics. Our evaluation shows that TyFlow not only eliminates type errors but also significantly improves functional correctness, highlighting the importance of aligning LMs with type systems internally.</p></details> |  |
| **[MDAgent2: Large Language Model for Code Generation and Knowledge Q&A in Molecular Dynamics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02075v4)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for understanding atomic-scale behaviors in materials science, yet writing LAMMPS scripts remains highly specialized and time-consuming tasks. Although LLMs show promise in code generation and domain-specific question answering, their performance in MD scenarios is limited by scarce domain data, the high deployment cost of state-of-the-art LLMs, and low code executability. Building upon our prior MDAgent, we present MDAgent2, the first end-to-end framework capable of performing both knowledge Q&A and code generation within the MD domain. We construct a domain-specific data-construction pipeline that yields three high-quality datasets spanning MD knowledge, question answering, and code generation. Based on these datasets, we adopt a three stage post-training strategy--continued pre-training (CPT), supervised fine-tuning (SFT), and reinforcement learning (RL)--to train two domain-adapted models, MD-Instruct and MD-Code. Furthermore, we introduce MD-GRPO, a closed-loop RL method that leverages simulation outcomes as reward signals and recycles low-reward trajectories for continual refinement. We further build MDAgent2-RUNTIME, a deployable multi-agent system that integrates code generation, execution, evaluation, and self-correction. Together with MD-EvalBench proposed in this work, the first benchmark for LAMMPS code generation and question answering, our models and system achieve performance surpassing several strong baselines.This work systematically demonstrates the adaptability and generalization capability of large language models in industrial simulation tasks, laying a methodological foundation for automatic code generation in AI for Science and industrial-scale simulations.

| **[Rethinking the effects of data contamination in Code Intelligence](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.02791v3)** | 2026-02-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, code intelligence has gained increasing importance in the field of automated software engineering. Meanwhile, the widespread adoption of Pretrained Language Models (PLMs) and Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised concerns regarding data contamination and its potential impact on model performance evaluation. Previous studies mainly focused on sample-level contamination, ignoring partial contamination scenarios that are pervasive in code intelligence. This paper fills this gap and presents a systematic empirical study to investigate the fine-grained data contamination on mainstream code tasks. Our study involves diverse representative PLMs: RoBERTa and GPT-2, and LLMs: LLaMA and StarCoder, covering three major tasks: code translation, code generation, and code summarization, across two Programming Languages (PLs): Java and Python. We categorize contamination scenarios into four types according to the code intelligence practice, namely input-only, output-only, unpaired, and paired contamination settings, and construct corresponding experimental and control groups for exploration. Experimental results show that, under the pre-training, fine-tuning, and inference paradigm adopted by PLMs, even deliberately injecting paired contamination does not lead to significant performance overestimation. But direct inference or small-scale fine-tuning uncovers the contamination effects. In contrast, LLMs with pre-training and inference paradigm are significantly affected by the paired contamination. Apart from the above, other contamination scenarios have no impact on both PLMs and LLMs. Our findings challenge the conventional belief that contamination inevitably leads to performance overestimation, providing new insights into the evaluation and deployment of code intelligence models.</p></details> |  |

We first show some properties of optimal solutions, which are then used to decompose the problem into instances of the multidimensional knapsack cover problem with a single continuous variable per dimension. The proposed decomposition is used to design a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem with a fixed number of constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approximation scheme for such a general class of covering mixed-integer linear programs. Moreover, we design a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme and an approximate linear programming formulation for the case with a single constraint. These results improve upon the previously best-known 2-approximation algorithm for the knapsack cover problem with a single continuous variable. Finally, we show a perfect compact formulation for the case where all variables have the same lower and upper bounds. Analogous results are derived for the packing and more general variants of the problem.</p></details> | 20 pages |

GLP was designed as a language for grassroots platforms -- distributed systems with multiple instances that can operate independently of each other and of any global resource, and can coalesce into ever larger instances -- with its target architecture being smartphones communicating peer-to-peer. The operational semantics of Concurrent (single-agent) GLP and of multiagent GLP (maGLP) were defined via transition systems/multiagent transition systems, respectively. Here, we describe the mathematics developed to facilitate the workstation- and smartphone-based implementations of GLP by AI in Dart. We developed dGLP -- implementation-ready deterministic operational semantics for single-agent GLP -- and proved it correct with respect to the Concurrent GLP operational semantics; dGLP was used by AI as a formal spec, from which it developed a workstation-based implementation of GLP. We developed madGLP -- an implementation-ready multiagent operational semantics for maGLP -- and proved it correct with respect to the maGLP operational semantics; madGLP is deterministic at the agent level (not at the system level due to communication asynchrony), and is being used by AI as a formal spec from which it develops a smartphone-based implementation of maGLP.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Weakest Precondition Calculus for Programs and Linear Temporal Specifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10746v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auto-active program verification rests on the ability to effectively the translation from annotated programs into verification conditions that are then discharged by automated theorem provers in the background. Characteristic such tools, e.g., Why3, Dafny, and Viper, is that this process does not involve user interaction, expecting all guiding hints like invariants to be given upfront. For sequential correctness, this paradigm is well established, thanks to approaches like weakest precondition generation and symbolic execution. However, to capture temporal properties, the specification language of choice for a broader system perspective, additional concerns and challenges are introduced into the translation and proof. Approaches based on symbolic model-checking can verify such properties on system models, e.g., using automata constructions. However, ascribing temporal properties to structured and data-intensive programs is more difficult. Several program calculi have been proposed in the literature, each of which on their own falls short in some regard of supporting an auto-active workflow. However, all essential ideas, while perhaps some are not widely acknowledged, are in fact found in the literature. In this paper, we demonstrate how to assemble these ideas into a weakest-precondition calculus for linear temporal properties and demonstrate it with examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[CODE-SHARP: Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10085v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing agents capable of open-endedly discovering and learning novel skills is a grand challenge in Artificial Intelligence. While reinforcement learning offers a powerful framework for training agents to master complex skills, it typically relies on hand-designed reward functions. This is infeasible for open-ended skill discovery, where the set of meaningful skills is not known a priori. While recent methods have shown promising results towards automating reward function design, they remain limited to refining rewards for pre-defined tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs (CODE-SHARP), a novel framework leveraging Foundation Models (FM) to open-endedly expand and refine a hierarchical skill archive, structured as a directed graph of executable reward functions in code. We show that a goal-conditioned agent trained exclusively on the rewards generated by the discovered SHARP skills learns to solve increasingly long-horizon goals in the Craftax environment. When composed by a high-level FM-based planner, the discovered skills enable a single goal-conditioned agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks, outperforming both pretrained agents and task-specific expert policies by over $134$% on average. We will open-source our code and provide additional videos at https://sites.google.com/view/code-sharp/homepage.</p></details> | Preprint |

Yet despite the introduction of natively multimodal Generative AI models, work on Human-GenAI collaborative coding has remained overwhelmingly focused on textual prompts -- largely ignoring the visual and spatial representations that programmers naturally use to reason about and communicate their designs. In this proposal and position paper, we argue and provide tentative evidence that this text-centric focus overlooks other forms of prompting GenAI models, such as problem decomposition diagrams functioning as prompts for code generation in their own right enabling new types of programming activities and assessments. To support this position, we present findings from a large introductory Python programming course, where students constructed decomposition diagrams that were used to prompt GPT-4.1 for code generation. We demonstrate that current models are very successful in their ability to generate code from student-constructed diagrams. We conclude by exploring the implications of embracing multimodal prompting for computing education, particularly in the context of assessment.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Priors for ERM over Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14331v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study program-learning methods that are efficient in both samples and computation. Classical learning theory suggests that when the target admits a short program description (for example, a short piece of ``Python code''), it can be learned from relatively few examples by performing ERM over the program class. However, this approach relies on enumerating candidate programs, which is typically exponential in the description length. In contrast, gradient-based training avoids explicit search, but for some families of short programs it can require exponentially many samples to succeed. We propose \textsc{LLM-PV}, a propose-and-verify recipe that enables ERM-style selection over a discrete program class without exhaustive enumeration. A pretrained LLM induces a proposal distribution over candidate programs; each proposal is executed, scored on a held-out validation set, and the best program is selected. The method uses no gradient updates and does not use validation feedback to adapt the sampling distribution. Across algorithmic tasks including parity variants, pattern matching, and primality testing, \textsc{LLM-PV} often recovers the exact underlying rule from a small labeled set and generalizes far beyond the training sequence lengths. In the same regimes, SGD-trained transformers and standard adaptation baselines (fine-tuning and in-context learning), as well as classical ML baselines, can fit the training data yet fail to generalize reliably. Together, these results suggest that pretrained LLM priors can serve as effective search biases for ERM, narrowing the gap between statistical and computational efficiency. The code is available at [\href{https://github.com/DLFundamentals/LLM_PV}{code}].</p></details> |  |

These embeddings predict students' skills across multiple programming topics, producing profiles that are matched to the skills required by unseen homework problems. To generate recommendations, we compute the cosine similarity between student profiles and problem skill vectors, ranking exercises according to their alignment with each student's current abilities. We evaluated our approach using real data from students and exercises in an introductory programming course at our university. First, we assessed the effectiveness of our source code embeddings for predicting skills, comparing them with token-based and graph-based alternatives. Results showed that Jina embeddings outperformed TF-IDF, CodeBERT-cpp, and GraphCodeBERT across most skills. Additionally, we evaluated the system's ability to recommend exercises aligned with weekly course content by analyzing student submissions collected over seven course offerings. Our approach consistently produced more suitable recommendations than baselines based on correctness or solution time, indicating that predicted programming skills provide a stronger signal for problem recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, to be published in LAK26: 16th International Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference (LAK 2026)</p></details> |

So far, it has not been explored how various techniques for creating Behavior Tree (BT) program representations could be combined with complete graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to allow a human user to validate and edit trees suggested by automated methods. In this paper, we introduce BEhavior TRee GUI (BETR-GUI) for creating BTs with the help of an AI assistant that combines methods using large language models, planning, genetic programming, and Bayesian optimization with a drag-and-drop editor. A user study with 60 participants shows that by combining different assistive methods, BETR-GUI enables users to perform better at solving the robot programming tasks.

In this paper, we address this gap by formalizing the Program-to-Geometry task, which challenges models to translate programmatic drawing code into accurate and abstract geometric reasoning. To evaluate this capability, we present GeoGramBench, a benchmark of 500 carefully refined problems organized by a tailored three-level taxonomy that considers geometric complexity rather than traditional mathematical reasoning complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier LLMs reveals consistent and pronounced deficiencies: even the most advanced models achieve less than 50% accuracy at the highest abstraction level. These results highlight the unique challenges posed by program-driven spatial reasoning and establish GeoGramBench as a valuable resource for advancing research in symbolic-to-spatial geometric reasoning.

Very recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), an increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed, facilitating software development and maintenance and demonstrating remarkable performance. However, due to ongoing explorations in the LLM-based APR field, it is challenging for researchers to understand the current achievements, challenges, and potential opportunities. This work provides the first systematic literature review to summarize the applications of LLMs in APR between 2020 and 2025. We analyze 189 relevant papers from LLMs, APR and their integration perspectives. First, we categorize existing popular LLMs that are applied to support APR and outline four types of utilization strategies for their deployment. Besides, we detail some specific repair scenarios that benefit from LLMs, e.g., semantic bugs and security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs into APR research, e.g., input forms and open science. Finally, we highlight a set of challenges remaining to be investigated and the potential guidelines for future research. Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to the APR community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of achievements and promote future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM 2026)</p></details> |
| **[On A Parameterized Theory of Dynamic Logic for Operationally-based Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09307v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applying dynamic logics to program verifications is a challenge, because their axiomatic rules for regular expressions can be difficult to be adapted to different program models. We present a novel dynamic logic, called DLp, which supports reasoning based on programs' operational semantics. For those programs whose transitional behaviours are their standard or natural semantics, DLp makes their verifications easier since one can directly apply the program transitions for reasoning, without the need of re-designing and validating new rules as in most other dynamic logics. DLp is parametric. It provides a model-independent framework consisting of a relatively small set of inference rules, which depends on a given set of trustworthy rules for the operational semantics. These features of DLp let multiple models easily compared in its framework and makes it compatible with existing dynamic-logic theories. DLp supports cyclic reasoning, providing an incremental derivation process for recursive programs, making it more convenient to reason about without prior program transformations. We analyze and prove the soundness and completeness of DLp under certain conditions. Several case studies illustrate the features of DLp and fully demonstrate its potential usage.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiMat: Multimodal Program Synthesis for Procedural Materials using Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22151v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Material node graphs are programs that generate the 2D channels of procedural materials, including geometry such as roughness and displacement maps, and reflectance such as albedo and conductivity maps. They are essential in computer graphics for representing the appearance of virtual 3D objects parametrically and at arbitrary resolution. In particular, their directed acyclic graph structure and intermediate states enable a modular, interpretable workflow for interactive appearance modeling. However, creating such graphs remains challenging and typically requires professional training. While recent neural program synthesis approaches attempt to simplify this process, they solely represent graphs as textual programs, failing to capture the inherently visual-spatial nature of node graphs that makes them accessible to humans. To address this gap, we present MultiMat, a multimodal program synthesis framework that leverages large multimodal models to process both visual and textual graph representations for improved generation of procedural material graphs. We train our models on a new dataset of production-quality procedural materials and combine them with a constrained tree search inference algorithm that ensures static correctness while efficiently navigating the program space. Our experimental results show that our multimodal program synthesis method is more efficient in both unconditional and conditional graph synthesis with higher visual quality and fidelity than text-only baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026 (poster)</p></details> |

Typically, researchers study program synthesis via large language models (LLMs) which introduce issues such as knowing what is in or out of distribution, understanding fine-tuning effects, understanding the effects of tokenization, and higher demand on compute and storage to carry out experiments. We present a system called Cadmus which includes an integer virtual machine (VM), a dataset composed of true programs of diverse tasks, and an autoregressive transformer model that is trained for under \$200 of compute cost. The system can be used to study program completion, out-of-distribution representations, inductive reasoning, and instruction following in a setting where researchers have effective and affordable fine-grained control of the training distribution and the ability to inspect and instrument models. Smaller models working on complex reasoning tasks enable instrumentation and investigations that may be prohibitively expensive on larger models. To demonstrate that these tasks are complex enough to be of interest, we show that these Cadmus models outperform GPT-5 (by achieving 100\% accuracy while GPT-5 has 95\% accuracy) even on a simple task of completing correct, integer arithmetic programs in our domain-specific language (DSL) while providing transparency into the dataset's relationship to the problem. We also show that GPT-5 brings unknown priors into its reasoning process when solving the same tasks, demonstrating a confounding factor that prevents the use of large-scale LLMs for some investigations where the training set relationship to the task needs to be fully understood.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable Logical Programming for Quantum Circuit Discovery and Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08880v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing high-fidelity quantum circuits remains challenging, and current paradigms often depend on heuristic, fixed-ansatz structures or rule-based compilers that can be suboptimal or lack generality. We introduce a neuro-symbolic framework that reframes quantum circuit design as a differentiable logic programming problem. Our model represents a scaffold of potential quantum gates and parameterized operations as a set of learnable, continuous ``truth values'' or ``switches,'' $s \in [0, 1]^N$. These switches are optimized via standard gradient descent to satisfy a user-defined set of differentiable, logical axioms (e.g., correctness, simplicity, robustness). We provide a theoretical formulation bridging continuous logic (via T-norms) and unitary evolution (via geodesic interpolation), while addressing the barren plateau problem through biased initialization. We illustrate the approach on tasks including discovery of a 4-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) from a scaffold of 21 candidate gates. We also report a hardware-aware adaptation experiment on the 133-qubit IBM Torino processor, where the method improved fidelity by 59.3 percentage points in a localized routing task while adapting to hardware failures.</p></details> |  |

While prior works have focused on prompt design and code generation quality, the broader impact of LLM-driven development on the iterative dynamics of software engineering remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct large-scale experiments on thousands of algorithmic programming tasks and hundreds of framework selection tasks to systematically investigate how AI-assisted programming interacts with the software ecosystem. Our analysis quantifies a substantial performance asymmetry: mainstream languages and frameworks achieve significantly higher success rates than niche ones. This disparity suggests a feedback loop consistent with the Matthew Effect, where data-rich ecosystems gain superior AI support. While not the sole driver of adoption, current models introduce a non-negligible productivity friction for niche technologies, representing a hidden bias in software evolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Specification Vibing for Automated Program Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08263v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-driven automated program repair (APR) has advanced rapidly, but most methods remain code-centric: they directly rewrite source code and thereby risk hallucinated, behaviorally inconsistent fixes. This limitation suggests the need for an alternative repair paradigm that relies on a representation more accessible to LLMs than raw code, enabling more accurate understanding, analysis, and alignment during repair. To address this gap, we propose VibeRepair, a specification-centric APR technique that treats repair as behavior-specification repair rather than ad-hoc code editing. VibeRepair first translates buggy code into a structured behavior specification that captures the program's intended runtime behavior, then infers and repairs specification misalignments, and finally synthesizes code strictly guided by the corrected behavior specification. An on-demand reasoning component enriches hard cases with program analysis and historical bug-fix evidence while controlling cost. Across Defects4J and real-world benchmarks and multiple LLMs, VibeRepair demonstrates consistently strong repair effectiveness with a significantly smaller patch space. On Defects4J v1.2, VibeRepair correctly repairs 174 bugs, exceeding the strongest state-of-the-art baseline by 28 bugs, which corresponds to a 19% improvement. On Defects4J v2.0, it repairs 178 bugs, outperforming prior approaches by 33 bugs, representing a 23% improvement. Evaluations on real-world benchmarks collected after the training period of selected LLMs further confirm its effectiveness and generalizability. By centering repair on explicit behavioral intent, VibeRepair reframes APR for the era of "vibe" coding: make the behavior sing, and the code will follow.</p></details> |  |

Through systematic analysis of programming language token representations, we characterize how programming languages are encoded in LLM tokenizers by analyzing their vocabulary distribution and keyword coverage patterns. We introduce a novel cold-start probability analysis method that provides insights into model behavior without requiring explicit prompts. Additionally, we present a comprehensive evaluation of how different model optimization techniques - including quantization, distillation, model scaling, and task-specific fine-tuning - affect token-level representations and code generation quality. Our experiments, supported by comprehensive probability distribution analysis and evaluation metrics, reveal critical insights into token-level behavior and provide empirically-validated guidelines for maintaining code generation quality under various optimization constraints. These findings advance both theoretical understanding of LLM code generation and practical implementation of optimized models in production environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 1 figure and 6 tables</p></details> |

Here, we present Grassroots Logic Programs (GLP), a multiagent concurrent logic programming language designed for the implementation of grassroots platforms. We introduce the language incrementally: We recall the standard operational semantics of logic programs; introduce the operational semantics of Concurrent (single-agent) GLP as a restriction of that of LP; recall the notion of multiagent transition systems and atomic transactions; introduce the operational semantics of multiagent GLP via a multiagent transition system specified via atomic transactions; and prove multiagent GLP to be grassroots. The accompanying programming example is the grassroots social graph -- the infrastructure grassroots platform on which all others are based. With the mathematical foundations presented here: a workstation-based implementation of Concurrent GLP was developed by AI, based on the operational semantics of Concurrent GLP; a distributed peer-to-peer smartphone-based implementation of multiagent GLP is being developed by AI, based on the operational semantics of multiagent GLP; a moded type system for GLP was implemented by AI, to facilitate the specification of GLP programs by human and AI designers, for their programming by AI; all reported in detail in companion papers.</p></details> |  |
| **[PBEBench: A Multi-Step Programming by Examples Reasoning Benchmark inspired by Historical Linguistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23126v4)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although many benchmarks evaluate the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) within domains such as mathematics, coding, or data wrangling, few abstract away from domain specifics to examine reasoning as a capability in and of itself. We contribute a novel type of benchmark evaluating the inductive reasoning capabilities of LLMs that is inspired by the forward reconstruction task from historical linguistics but is formulated in an extremely simple, general way (in the form of Programming by Examples). The task involves generating a cascade of simple string rewrite programs to transform a given list of input strings into a list of desired output strings. We present a fully automated pipeline that programmatically generates problems of this type with controllable difficulty, enabling scalable evaluation of reasoning models while avoiding contamination. Using this approach, we construct two benchmarks: PBEBench-Lite, which efficiently stratifies models of varying capabilities, and PBEBench, which requires models to induce programs similar in complexity to those constructed by historical linguists. Our experiments reveal a substantial performance gap between models that leverage test-time compute or LCoT (long chain-of-thought) reasoning and those that do not. Moreover, although recent models show promise, the solve rate for both of them drops below 5% for hard instances of the PBEBench dataset (ground truth cascade lengths of 20 and 30, respectively), falling well short of realistic historical linguistics requirements even with computationally expensive, popular scaling techniques from the PBE and reasoning literature. Additionally, we also study the effectiveness of different scaling strategies and the impact of various hyperparameters on the difficulty of the generated data using gpt-oss-120b, the best-performing open-source model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous Program Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07659v1)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Genetic Programming yields interpretable programs, but small syntactic mutations can induce large, unpredictable behavioral shifts, degrading locality and sample efficiency. We frame this as an operator-design problem: learn a continuous program space where latent distance has behavioral meaning, then design mutation operators that exploit this structure without changing the evolutionary optimizer. We make locality measurable by tracking action-level divergence under controlled latent perturbations, identifying an empirical trust region for behavior-local continuous variation. Using a compact trading-strategy DSL with four semantic components (long/short entry and exit), we learn a matching block-factorized embedding and compare isotropic Gaussian mutation over the full latent space to geometry-compiled mutation that restricts updates to semantically paired entry--exit subspaces and proposes directions using a learned flow-based model trained on logged mutation outcomes. Under identical $(μ+λ)$ evolution strategies and fixed evaluation budgets across five assets, the learned mutation operator discovers strong strategies using an order of magnitude fewer evaluations and achieves the highest median out-of-sample Sharpe ratio. Although isotropic mutation occasionally attains higher peak performance, geometry-compiled mutation yields faster, more reliable progress, demonstrating that semantically aligned mutation can substantially improve search efficiency without modifying the underlying evolutionary algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Despite remarkable progress, APR is still limited in generating overfitting patches, i.e., patches passing available test suites but incorrect. This issue, known as patch overfitting, has become a key concern in the APR community, with numerous approaches proposed to address it. Very recent work proposes a pre-trained language model (PLM)-based automated patch correctness assessment (APCA) approach, indicating the potential of such PLMs in reasoning about patch correctness. Despite being promising, it is still far from perfect due to various limitations, such as the training paradigm and training dataset. In this paper, we present ComPass, a PLM-based APCA approach that leverages contrastive learning and data augmentation to address the technical limitations of prior work. Our work is inspired by the opportunity to integrate contrastive learning with recent PLMs in the field of patch correctness assessment, where large-scale labeled patches are difficult to obtain. ComPass utilizes code transformation rules to generate semantic-preserving code snippets for both unlabeled pre-training corpus and labeled fine-tuning patches. ComPass then pre-trains PLMs with contrastive learning, which captures code features with the same semantics but different structures. ComPass finally integrates representation embeddings of patch code snippets and fine-tunes PLMs with a binary classifier jointly to assess patch code correctness. Experimental results on 2274 real-world patches from Defects4J demonstrate that ComPass achieves an accuracy of 88.35%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline APPT.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |

For this reason, their use-cases are restricted to situations where imprecision isn't prohibitive. In this paper, we propose and specify a static analysis that accepts user-supplied program assumptions that are local to program locations. Such assumptions can be used to counteract imprecision in static analyses, enabling their use in a much wider variety of applications. These assumptions are taken by the analyzer non-deterministically, resulting in a function from sets of accepted assumptions to the resulting analysis under those assumptions. We also demonstrate the utility of such a function in two ways, both of which showcase how it can enable optimization over a search space of assumptions that is otherwise infeasible without the specified analysis.</p></details> |  |

When small language models are tasked with generating probabilistic programs, they frequently produce outputs that suffer from both syntactic and semantic errors, such as flawed inference constructs. Motivated by probabilistic programmers' domain expertise and debugging strategies, we introduce RefineStat, a language model--driven framework that enforces semantic constraints ensuring synthesized programs contain valid distributions and well-formed parameters, and then applies diagnostic-aware refinement by resampling prior or likelihood components whenever reliability checks fail. We evaluate RefineStat on multiple probabilistic-programming code-generation tasks using smaller language models (SLMs) and find that it produces programs that are both syntactically sound and statistically reliable, often matching or surpassing those from closed-source large language models (e.g., OpenAI o3).</p></details> | <details><summary>Refin...</summary><p>RefineStat constrains LM decoding with statistical validity checks and uses diagnostic-guided resampling (priors/likelihoods) to transform small LMs' drafts into correct, reliable probabilistic programs that can match or surpass closed-source models</p></details> |

We present a filtering and segmentation algorithm for detecting precipitates in FIB cross-section micrographs, optimized using linear genetic programming (LGP), which accounts for the various artifacts. To this end, the optimization environment uses a domain-specific language for image processing to iterate on solutions. Programs in this language are a list of image-filtering blocks with tunable parameters that sequentially process an input image, allowing for reliable generation and mutation by a genetic algorithm. Our environment produces optimized human-interpretable MATLAB code representing an image filtering pipeline. Under ideal conditions--a population size of 60 and a maximum program length of 5 blocks--our system was able to find a near-human accuracy solution with an average evaluation error of 1.8% when comparing segmentations pixel-by-pixel to a human baseline using an XOR error evaluation. Our automation work enabled faster iteration cycles and furthered exploration of the material composition and processing space: our optimized pipeline algorithm processes a 3.6 megapixel image in about 2 seconds on average. This ultimately enables convergence on strong, low-activation, precipitation hardened copper alloys for additive manufactured fusion reactor parts.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 12 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Existing systems and compiler-based approaches offer reliability but are either heavyweight or support only a limited set of optimizations. Conversely, using LLMs in a per-program optimization methodology can synthesize nontrivial optimizations, but is unreliable, expensive, and offers a low yield. In this work, we introduce a hybrid approach that works in a 3-stage manner that decouples discovery from deployment and connects them via a novel bridge. First, it discovers per-program optimizations (discovery). Second, they are converted into generalised rewrite rules (bridge). Finally, these rules are incorporated into a compiler that can automatically apply them wherever applicable, eliminating repeated reliance on LLMs (deployment). We demonstrate that RuleFlow is the new state-of-the-art (SOTA) Pandas optimization framework on PandasBench, a challenging Pandas benchmark consisting of Python notebooks. Across these notebooks, we achieve a speedup of up to 4.3x over Dias, the previous compiler-based SOTA, and 1914.9x over Modin, the previous systems-based SOTA.

However, a persistent challenge has been to construct highly optimized and often complex designs. This contribution formulates and solves new mixed-integer linear programs that enable consideration of the interplay between environmental impact and constructability. Specifically, the design engineer is enabled to design with multiple materials and/or structural components, apply separate minimum and maximum cross-sectional area bounds, and constrain the complexity of the structural connections. This is done while explicitly considering compatibility and constitutive laws. The results demonstrate that the lowest embodied carbon designs change significantly when constructability constraints are applied, highlighting the need for an integrated optimization approach. In one example, introducing a lower-carbon material option has almost no effect on the environmental performance, whereas another sees an improvement of nearly 29%. The extensibility of the formulation to design with three component types and additional constraints is demonstrated for a prestressed tensegrity example.</p></details> | 38 pages, 23 figures |

In programming classrooms, we aim to leverage its feedback capabilities while reinforcing the educator's role in guiding student-AI interactions. We developed ClassAid, a real-time orchestration system that integrates TA Agents to provide personalized support and an AI-driven dashboard that visualizes student-AI interactions, enabling instructors to dynamically adjust TA Agent modes. Instructors can configure the Agent to provide technical feedback (direct coding solutions), heuristic feedback (hint-based guidance), automatic feedback (autonomously selecting technical or heuristic support), or silent operation (no AI support). We evaluated ClassAid through three aspects: (1) the TA Agents' performance, (2) feedback from 54 students and one instructor during a classroom deployment, and (3) interviews with eight educators. Results demonstrate that dynamic instructor control over AI supports effective real-time personalized feedback and provides design implications for integrating AI into authentic educational settings.</p></details> |  |

While numerous studies address full-full and partial-full 3D shape matching, only a limited number of works have explored the partial-partial setting, very likely due to its unique challenges: we must compute accurate correspondences while at the same time find the unknown overlapping region. Nevertheless, partial-partial 3D shape matching reflects the most realistic setting, as in many real-world cases, such as 3D scanning, shapes are only partially observable. In this work, we introduce the first integer linear programming approach specifically designed to address the distinctive challenges of partial-partial shape matching. Our method leverages geometric consistency as a strong prior, enabling both robust estimation of the overlapping region and computation of neighbourhood-preserving correspondences. We empirically demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality matching results both in terms of matching error and smoothness. Moreover, we show that our method is more scalable than previous formalisms.</p></details> |  |

Although traditional methods, such as constrained decoding, alleviate this problem by externally rejecting untypable code, the model itself does not effectively learn type reasoning internally, which ultimately limits its overall performance. This paper introduces TyFlow, a novel system that internalizes type reasoning within code generation to guide the model to learn the type system. The core of our approach is a novel type-guided program synthesis system that maintains an isomorphism between type derivation trees and synthesis derivation trees, enabling a new code representation based on synthesis decision sequences rather than traditional text-based token sequences. By offloading the complexity of type system learning to the representation itself, models can redirect their computational resources toward higher-level program semantics. Our evaluation shows that TyFlow not only eliminates type errors but also significantly improves functional correctness, highlighting the importance of aligning LMs with type systems internally.</p></details> |  |

Even beyond the U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability, making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of applying semantic parsing methods to statutory reasoning, and show promising economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic architectures for increasing access to reliable tax assistance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[SVRepair: Structured Visual Reasoning for Automated Program Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.06090v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently shown strong potential for Automated Program Repair (APR), yet most existing approaches remain unimodal and fail to leverage the rich diagnostic signals contained in visual artifacts such as screenshots and control-flow graphs. In practice, many bug reports convey critical information visually (e.g., layout breakage or missing widgets), but directly using such dense visual inputs often causes context loss and noise, making it difficult for MLLMs to ground visual observations into precise fault localization and executable patches. To bridge this semantic gap, we propose \textbf{SVRepair}, a multimodal APR framework with structured visual representation. SVRepair first fine-tunes a vision-language model, \textbf{Structured Visual Representation (SVR)}, to uniformly transform heterogeneous visual artifacts into a \emph{semantic scene graph} that captures GUI elements and their structural relations (e.g., hierarchy), providing normalized, code-relevant context for downstream repair. Building on the graph, SVRepair drives a coding agent to localize faults and synthesize patches, and further introduces an iterative visual-artifact segmentation strategy that progressively narrows the input to bug-centered regions to suppress irrelevant context and reduce hallucinations. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: SVRepair achieves \textbf{36.47\%} accuracy on SWE-Bench M, \textbf{38.02\%} on MMCode, and \textbf{95.12\%} on CodeVision, validating the effectiveness of SVRepair for multimodal program repair.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |

An Empirical Study of Fuzzing Bug Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05312v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzzing has become a popular technique for automatically detecting vulnerabilities and bugs by generating unexpected inputs. In recent years, the fuzzing process has been integrated into continuous integration workflows (i.e., continuous fuzzing), enabling short and frequent testing cycles. Despite its widespread adoption, prior research has not examined whether the effectiveness of continuous fuzzing varies across programming languages. This study conducts a large-scale cross-language analysis to examine how fuzzing bug characteristics and detection efficiency differ among languages. We analyze 61,444 fuzzing bugs and 999,248 builds from 559 OSS-Fuzz projects categorized by primary language. Our findings reveal that (i) C++ and Rust exhibit higher fuzzing bug detection frequencies, (ii) Rust and Python show low vulnerability ratios but tend to expose more critical vulnerabilities, (iii) crash types vary across languages and unreproducible bugs are more frequent in Go but rare in Rust, and (iv) Python attains higher patch coverage but suffers from longer time-to-detection. These results demonstrate that fuzzing behavior and effectiveness are strongly shaped by language design, providing insights for language-aware fuzzing strategies and tool development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 23rd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR 2026). 12 pages, 9 figures</p></details> |
| **[From Sequential to Parallel: Reformulating Dynamic Programming as GPU Kernels for Large-Scale Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05179v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major bottleneck in scenario-based Sample Average Approximation (SAA) for stochastic programming (SP) is the cost of solving an exact second-stage problem for every scenario, especially when each scenario contains an NP-hard combinatorial structure. This has led much of the SP literature to restrict the second stage to linear or simplified models. We develop a GPU-based framework that makes full-fidelity integer second-stage models tractable at scale. The key innovation is a set of hardware-aware, scenario-batched GPU kernels that expose parallelism across scenarios, dynamic-programming (DP) layers, and route or action options, enabling Bellman updates to be executed in a single pass over more than 1,000,000 realizations. We evaluate the approach in two representative SP settings: a vectorized split operator for stochastic vehicle routing and a DP for inventory reinsertion. Implementation scales nearly linearly in the number of scenarios and achieves a one-two to four-five orders of magnitude speedup, allowing far larger scenario sets and reliably stronger first-stage decisions. The computational leverage directly improves decision quality: much larger scenario sets and many more first-stage candidates can be evaluated within fixed time budgets, consistently yielding stronger SAA solutions. Our results show that full-fidelity integer second-stage models are tractable at scales previously considered impossible, providing a practical path to large-scale, realistic stochastic discrete optimization.</p></details> |  |

The Case of SWE-Bench in Automated Program Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04449v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress in Automated Program Repair (APR) has been fueled by advances in AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) and agent-based systems. SWE-Bench is a benchmark designed to evaluate repair systems using real issues mined from popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards-SWE-Bench Lite and Verified-have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of these two leaderboards, examining who is submitting solutions, the products behind the submissions, the LLMs employed, and the openness of the approaches. We analyze 79 entries submitted to Lite leaderboard and 133 to Verified. Our results show that most entries on both leaderboards originate from industry, particularly small companies and large publicly traded companies. These submissions often achieve top results, although academic contributions-typically open source-also remain competitive. We also find a clear dominance of proprietary LLMs, especially Claude family, with state-of-the-art results on both leaderboards currently achieved by Claude 4 Sonnet. These findings offer insights into the SWE-Bench ecosystem that can guide greater transparency and diversity in future benchmark-driven research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 2026 IEEE/ACM 48th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE-SEIP'26). https://doi.org/10.1145/3786583.3786904</p></details> |

While MCPs are typically estimated from high-dimensional gene expression data using methods like sparse principal component analysis or latent factor models, these approaches often suffer from high computational costs and limited statistical power. In this work, we propose Sparse Group Principal Component Analysis (SGPCA) to estimate MCPs by leveraging their inherent group and individual sparsity. We introduce an efficient double-thresholding algorithm based on power iteration. In each iteration, a group thresholding step first identifies relevant gene groups, followed by an individual thresholding step to select active cell types. This algorithm achieves a linear computational complexity of $O(np)$, making it highly efficient and scalable for large-scale genomic analyses. We establish theoretical guarantees for SGPCA, including statistical consistency and a convergence rate that surpasses competing methods. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that SGPCA achieves superior estimation accuracy and improved statistical power for signal detection. Furthermore, We apply SGPCA to a Lupus study, discovering differentially expressed MCPs distinguishing Lupus patients from normal subjects.</p></details> |  |

We show how to solve integer programs whose matrices have bounded TDM-treewidth when variables are bounded. This extends previous graph-based decomposition parameters for matrices with at most two nonzero entries per row to include matrices with entries outside of $\{-1,0,1\}$. We also give an analogue of the Grid Theorem of Robertson and Seymour for matrices of bounded TDM-treewidth in the language of rooted signed graphs.</p></details> | 20 pages |

As learning becomes increasingly personalized, considering individual learner characteristics becomes more important. This study investigates the moderating effect of spatial ability on learning experience with AR in the context of robot programming. A between-subjects experiment ($N=71$) compared conventional robot programming to an AR-assisted approach using a head-mounted display. Participants' spatial ability was assessed using the Mental Rotation Test. The learning experience was measured through the System Usability Scale (SUS) and cognitive load. The results indicate that AR support does not significantly improve the learning experience compared to the conventional approach. However, AR appears to have a compensatory effect on the influence of spatial ability. In the control group, spatial ability was significantly positively associated with SUS scores and negatively associated with extraneous cognitive load, indicating that higher spatial ability predicts a better learning experience. In the AR condition, these relationships were not observable, suggesting that AR mitigated the disadvantage typically experienced by learners with lower spatial abilities. These findings suggest that AR can serve a compensatory function by reducing the influence of learner characteristics. Future research should further explore this compensatory role of AR to guide the design of personalized learning environments that address diverse learner needs and reduce barriers for learners with varying cognitive profiles.</p></details> |  |

To explore the effectiveness of agentic workflows, we propose CP-Agent, a Python coding agent that uses the ReAct framework with a persistent IPython kernel. We provide the relevant domain knowledge as a project prompt of under 50 lines. The algorithm works by iteratively executing code, observing the solver's feedback, and refining constraint models based on execution results. We evaluate CP-Agent on 101 constraint programming problems from CP-Bench. We made minor changes to the benchmark to address systematic ambiguities in the problem specifications and errors in the ground-truth models. On the clarified benchmark, CP-Agent achieves perfect accuracy on all 101 problems. Our experiments show that minimal guidance outperforms detailed procedural scaffolding. Our experiments also show that explicit task management tools can have both positive and negative effects on focused modeling tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Programming for Epistemic Uncertainty in Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03381v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a general theory of ambiguity-averse MDPs, which treats the uncertain transition probabilities as random variables and evaluates a policy via a risk measure applied to its random return. This ambiguity-averse MDP framework unifies several models of MDPs with epistemic uncertainty for specific choices of risk measures. We extend the concepts of value functions and Bellman operators to our setting. Based on these objects, we establish the consequences of dynamic programming principles in this framework (existence of stationary policies, value and policy iteration algorithms), and we completely characterize law-invariant risk measures compatible with dynamic programming. Our work draws connections among several variants of MDP models and fully delineates what is possible under the dynamic programming paradigm and which risk measures require leaving it.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraint Matters: Multi-Modal Representation for Reducing Mixed-Integer Linear programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18742v3)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction, which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation time by 17.47\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accec...</summary><p>Accecpted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |
| **[BayeSQP: Bayesian Optimization through Sequential Quadratic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03232v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce BayeSQP, a novel algorithm for general black-box optimization that merges the structure of sequential quadratic programming with concepts from Bayesian optimization. BayeSQP employs second-order Gaussian process surrogates for both the objective and constraints to jointly model the function values, gradients, and Hessian from only zero-order information. At each iteration, a local subproblem is constructed using the GP posterior estimates and solved to obtain a search direction. Crucially, the formulation of the subproblem explicitly incorporates uncertainty in both the function and derivative estimates, resulting in a tractable second-order cone program for high probability improvements under model uncertainty. A subsequent one-dimensional line search via constrained Thompson sampling selects the next evaluation point. Empirical results show thatBayeSQP outperforms state-of-the-art methods in specific high-dimensional settings. Our algorithm offers a principled and flexible framework that bridges classical optimization techniques with modern approaches to black-box optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[HALF: Hollowing Analysis Framework for Binary Programs with Kernel Module Assistance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22043v3)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary program analysis represents a fundamental pillar of modern system security. Fine-grained methodologies like dynamic taint analysis still suffer from deployment complexity and performance overhead despite significant progress. Traditional in-process analysis tools trigger severe \textbf{address-space conflicts} that inevitably disrupt the native memory layout of the target. These conflicts frequently cause layout-sensitive exploits and evasive malware to deviate from their intended execution paths or fail entirely. This paper introduces \textbf{HALF} as a novel framework that resolves this fundamental tension while ensuring both analysis fidelity and practical performance. HALF achieves high-fidelity address-space transparency by leveraging a kernel-assisted process hollowing mechanism. This design effectively eliminates the observation artifacts that characterize traditional instrumentation tools. We further mitigate the synchronization latency of decoupled execution by implementing an exception-driven strategy via a lightweight kernel monitor. Extensive evaluation of a Windows-based prototype demonstrates that HALF maintains superior performance compared to conventional in-process baselines. HALF also provides unique capabilities for deconstructing complex, stealthy threats where existing frameworks fail to maintain execution integrity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM-based Specification Generation via Program Slicing and Logical Deletion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09917v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional formal specification generation methods are typically tailored to specific specification types, and therefore suffer from limited generality. In recent years, large language model (LLM)-based specification generation approaches have emerged, offering a new direction for improving the universality of automated specification synthesis. However, when dealing with complex control flow, LLMs often struggle to precisely generate complete specifications that cover substructures. Moreover, the distinctive verification pipelines adopted by existing approaches may incorrectly discard logically correct specifications, while verification tools alone cannot reliably identify correct specifications. To address these issues, we propose SLD-Spec, an LLM-based specification generation method that combines program slicing and logical deletion. Specifically, SLD-Spec augments the conventional specification generation framework with two key stages: (1) a program slicing stage that decomposes the target function into several smaller code slices, enabling LLMs to focus on more localized semantic structures and thereby improving specification relevance and completeness; and (2) a logical deletion stage that leverages LLMs to perform logical reasoning and filtering over candidate specifications so as to retain logically correct ones. Experimental results show that SLD-Spec consistently outperforms existing methods on datasets containing programs of varying complexity, verifying more programs and generating specifications that are more relevant and more complete. Further ablation studies indicate that program slicing mainly improves specification relevance and completeness, whereas logical deletion plays a key role in increasing verification success rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized Optimal Classification Trees: A Mixed-Integer Programming Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.02173v1)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Global optimization of decision trees is a long-standing challenge in combinatorial optimization, yet such models play an important role in interpretable machine learning. Although the problem has been investigated for several decades, only recent advances in discrete optimization have enabled practical algorithms for solving optimal classification tree problems on real-world datasets. Mixed-integer programming (MIP) offers a high degree of modeling flexibility, and we therefore propose a MIP-based framework for learning optimal classification trees under nonlinear performance metrics, such as the F1-score, that explicitly addresses class imbalance. To improve scalability, we develop problem-specific acceleration techniques, including a tailored branch-and-cut algorithm, an instance-reduction scheme, and warm-start strategies. We evaluate the proposed approach on 50 benchmark datasets. The computational results show that the framework can efficiently optimize nonlinear metrics while achieving strong predictive performance and reduced solution times compared with existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Programming Language Confusion: When Code LLMs Can't Keep their Languages Straight](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13620v2)** | 2026-02-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance across software engineering tasks, from code generation to translation. However, we identify and systematically evaluate a critical failure mode: Programming Language Confusion (PLC) -- the generation of code in unintended languages despite explicit instructions. Through evaluation of 10 popular LLMs across six multilingual datasets (LiveCodeBench, BabelCode variants, HumanEval-XL, and McEval), we demonstrate that PLC is pervasive, with some specialized models exhibiting the highest confusion rates. Our analysis reveals that PLC is not random noise but reflects systematic patterns: models consistently generate syntactically valid code even when it deviates from language specifications. This behavior produces distinct language migration patterns, most notably a strong default to Python and systematic shifts between syntactically similar language pairs (e.g., C#/Java). These migrations reflect statistical preferences learned from training data rather than goal-directed reasoning. We demonstrate that explicit language keywords provide the most effective mitigation, while natural language instructions have limited influence on model behavior. Furthermore, model quantization -- though essential for practical deployment -- significantly amplifies PLC and degrades syntactic stability in complex tasks. Our findings underscore that language fidelity should be treated as a core evaluation dimension for code LLMs. We advocate for standardized benchmarks and prompt formats with explicit language constraints to enable more reliable assessment and foster the development of robust, multilingual code generation systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at SANER 2026</p></details> |

Unlike prior methods based on merit functions or the augmented Lagrangian class of algorithms, FilterDDP uses a step filter in conjunction with a line search to handle equality constraints. We identify two important design choices for the step filter criteria which lead to robust numerical performance: 1) we use the Lagrangian instead of the cost in the step acceptance criterion and, 2) in the backward pass, we perturb the value function Hessian. Both choices are rigorously justified, for 2) in particular by a formal proof of local quadratic convergence. In addition to providing a primal-dual interior point extension for handling OCPs with both equality and inequality constraints, we validate FilterDDP on three contact implicit trajectory optimisation problems which arise in robotics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the IEEE International Conference on Robotics and Automation (ICRA) 2026</p></details> |

We present ASP-Bench, a benchmark comprising 128 natural language problem instances, 64 base problems with easy and hard variants. It evaluates systems that translate natural-language problems into Answer Set Programs (ASPs), a prominent form of logic programming. It provides systematic coverage of ASP features, including choice rules, aggregates, and optimization. Each problem includes reference validators that check whether solutions satisfy the problem specification. We characterize problems along seven largely independent reasoning aspects (optimization, temporal reasoning, default logic, resource allocation, recursion, spatial reasoning, and quantitative complexity), providing a multidimensional view of modeling difficulty. We test the benchmark using an agentic approach based on the ReAct (Reason and Act) framework, which achieves full saturation, demonstrating that feedback-driven iterative refinement with solver feedback provides a reliable and robust approach for modeling natural language in ASP. Our analysis across multiple agent runs enables us to gain insights into what determines a problem's modeling hardness.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate a critical question: Can we elevate models to expert-level reasoning performance using fully synthetic data? In response, we first observe that off-the-shelf synthesis methods yield suboptimal results in this domain. To address this, we systematically investigate the key factors governing synthetic data quality. Leveraging these findings, we significantly advance the feature-based synthesis paradigm via domain-specific evolution and a dual-verification strategy, promoting task solvability, solution correctness, and test accuracy. Using this high-quality synthetic data, we train the X-Coder model series under an SFT-then-RL paradigm. X-Coder-7B shows significant performance gains on the challenging LiveCodeBench v5 (62.9% avg@8) and v6 (55.8% avg@8), outperforming larger models trained on real-world data.

Inspired by the cognitive science of how people form abstractions and intuitive theories of their world knowledge, Theory-Based RL (TBRL) systems, such as TheoryCoder, exhibit strong generalization through effective use of abstractions. However, they heavily rely on human-provided abstractions and sidestep the abstraction-learning problem. We introduce TheoryCoder-2, a new TBRL agent that leverages LLMs' in-context learning ability to actively learn reusable abstractions rather than relying on hand-specified ones, by synthesizing abstractions from experience and integrating them into a hierarchical planning process. We conduct experiments on diverse environments, including BabyAI, Minihack and VGDL games like Sokoban. We find that TheoryCoder-2 is significantly more sample-efficient than baseline LLM agents augmented with classical planning domain construction, reasoning-based planning, and prior program-synthesis agents such as WorldCoder. TheoryCoder-2 is able to solve complex tasks that the baselines fail, while only requiring minimal human prompts, unlike prior TBRL systems.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Given a natural language goal and an evaluation method, KAPSO iteratively performs ideation, code synthesis and editing, execution, evaluation, and learning to improve a runnable artifact toward measurable objectives. Rather than treating synthesis as the endpoint, KAPSO uses synthesis as an operator within a long-horizon optimization loop, where progress is defined by evaluator outcomes. KAPSO targets long-horizon failures common in coding agents, including lost experimental state, brittle debugging, and weak reuse of domain expertise, by integrating three tightly coupled components. First, a git-native experimentation engine isolates each attempt as a branch, producing reproducible artifacts and preserving provenance across iterations. Second, a knowledge system ingests heterogeneous sources, including repositories, internal playbooks, and curated external resources such as documentation, scientific papers, and web search results, and organizes them into a structured representation that supports retrieval over workflows, implementations, and environment constraints. Third, a cognitive memory layer coordinates retrieval and maintains an episodic store of reusable lessons distilled from experiment traces (run logs, diffs, and evaluator feedback), reducing repeated error modes and accelerating convergence. We evaluated KAPSO on MLE-Bench (Kaggle-style ML competitions) and ALE-Bench (AtCoder heuristic optimization), and report end-to-end performance.

Scratch programs exhibit deeply nested, non-linear structures, event-driven concurrency across multiple sprites, and tight coupling between code and multimedia assets, properties that differ fundamentally from textual code. As a result, LLMs often misinterpret Scratch semantics and generate large, invasive edits that are syntactically valid but semantically incorrect when repairing buggy programs. We introduce ScratchEval, the first executable benchmark designed to evaluate LLM-based repair for Scratch programs, covering program understanding, debugging, analysis, and repair. The benchmark contains 100 curated Scratch projects from the public repository, selected for structural and semantic complexity. Each project is paired with executable test suites, bug descriptions with corresponding fixes, block-level edit constraints defining minimal semantically correct repairs, and required multimedia assets. The benchmark is constructed through a human-in-the-loop pipeline combining automated project mining with expert validation of trigger-outcome semantics and representative bug patterns, with emphasis on event ordering, concurrency, and state management. To enable rigorous and reproducible evaluation, we propose a three-layer executable protocol measuring functional correctness via VM-level execution, repair quality using block-level edit distance and behavioral trajectory comparisons, and explanation quality via structured rubrics assessing alignment between model reasoning and generated patches. Using ScratchEval, we study domain-specific fine-tuning, training data effectiveness, and model generalization to unseen bug types. ScratchEval provides a reproducible foundation for evaluating and post-training LLMs on block-based programming tasks.</p></details> |  |

Despite progress in basic shape-morphing design with simple geometries, achieving advanced applications such as conformal implant deployment or aerodynamic morphing requires accurate and diverse morphing designs on complex geometries, which remains challenging. Here, we present a Spectral and Spatial Neural Operator (S2NO), which enables high-fidelity morphing prediction on complex geometries. S2NO effectively captures global and local morphing behaviours on irregular computational domains by integrating Laplacian eigenfunction encoding and spatial convolutions. Combining S2NO with evolutionary algorithms enables voxel-level optimisation of material distributions for shape morphing programming on various complex geometries, including irregular-boundary shapes, porous structures, and thin-walled structures. Furthermore, the neural operator's discretisation-invariant property enables super-resolution material distribution design, further expanding the diversity and complexity of morphing design. These advancements significantly improve the efficiency and capability of programming complex shape morphing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combinatorial Algorithm for Tropical Linearly Factorized Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07596v3)** | 2026-01-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tropical semiring is an algebraic system with addition ``$\max$'' and multiplication ``$+$''. As well as in conventional algebra, linear programming in the tropical semiring has been developed. In this study, we introduce a new type of tropical optimization problem, namely, tropical linearly factorized programming. This problem involves minimizing the objective function given by a product of tropical linear forms divided by a tropical monomial, subject to tropical linear inequality constraints. As the objective function is equivalent to the dual of the transportation problem, it is convex in the conventional sense but not in the tropical sense, while the feasible set is convex in the tropical sense but not in the conventional sense. Our algorithm for tropical linearly factorized programming is based on the descent method. We first show that a feasible descent direction can be characterized in terms of a specific digraph, called a tangent digraph. Especially in non-degenerate cases, we present a simplex-like algorithm that updates the tree structure of tangent digraphs iteratively. Each iteration can be executed in $O(r_A+r_C)$ time, where $r_A$ and $r_C$ are the numbers of finite coefficients in the constraints and objective function, respectively. For integer instances, our algorithm finds a local optimum in pseudo-polynomial time.</p></details> |  |

With the recent popularity of platforms like GraalVM and other multi-language runtimes, creating and managing these systems has become much more feasible. However, current research on analyzing multilingual programs mainly focuses on two languages, leaving out the increasing complexity of systems that use three or more. For example, modern web systems often link JavaScript, WebAssembly, and Rust within the same execution chain. This paper envisions the landscape of software systems with three-language polyglot communication. We identify fundamental challenges in analyzing them and propose a conceptual roadmap to advance static analysis techniques to address them. Our vision aims to stimulate discussion and inspire new research directions toward scalable, language-agnostic analysis frameworks for next-generation polyglot systems.</p></details> |  |

We investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can accelerate program verification by generating useful loop invariants. We introduce Quokka, a first-order and effective framework for LLM-based invariant synthesis that provides sound evaluation while achieving state-of-the-art speedup results. Unlike prior work that designs complex, highly customized algorithms, Quokka employs a simple and principled verification procedure. We construct a benchmark of 866 instances and evaluate 9 state-of-the-art LLMs across multiple model families. Our results show that Quokka consistently outperforms all prior LLM-based verifiers: achieving speedups of at least 1.2x on 81 instances compared to 39 instances for the previous best approach. We further demonstrate that supervised fine-tuning and Best-of-N sampling can yield measurable improvements in accelerating verification.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as superoptimizers, generating assembly programs that outperform code already optimized by industry-standard compilers. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for this problem, consisting of 8,072 assembly programs averaging 130 lines, in contrast to prior datasets restricted to 2-15 straight-line, loop-free programs. We evaluate 23 LLMs on this benchmark and find that the strongest baseline, Claude-opus-4, achieves a 51.5% test-passing rate and a 1.43x average speedup over gcc -O3. To further enhance performance, we fine-tune models with reinforcement learning, optimizing a reward function that integrates correctness and performance speedup. Starting from Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct (61.4% correctness, 1.10x speedup), the fine-tuned model SuperCoder attains 95.0% correctness and 1.46x average speedup, with additional improvement enabled by Best-of-N sampling and iterative refinement. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that LLMs can be applied as superoptimizers for assembly programs, establishing a foundation for future research in program performance optimization beyond compiler heuristics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving 4-Block Integer Linear Programs Faster Using Affine Decompositions of the Right-Hand Sides](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.23083v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a new and faster algorithm for the 4-block integer linear programming problem, overcoming the long-standing runtime barrier faced by previous algorithms that rely on Graver complexity or proximity bounds. The 4-block integer linear programming problem asks to compute $\min\{c_0^\top x_0+c_1^\top x_1+\dots+c_n^\top x_n\ \vert\ Ax_0+Bx_1+\dots+Bx_n=b_0,\ Cx_0+Dx_i=b_i\ \forall i\in[n],\ (x_0,x_1,\dots,x_n)\in\mathbb Z_{\ge0}^{(1+n)k}\}$ for some $k\times k$ matrices $A,B,C,D$ with coefficients bounded by $\overlineΔ$ in absolute value. Our algorithm runs in time $f(k,\overlineΔ)\cdot n^{k+\mathcal O(1)}$, improving upon the previous best running time of $f(k,\overlineΔ)\cdot n^{k^2+\mathcal O(1)}$ [Oertel, Paat, and Weismantel (Math. Prog. 2024), Chen, Koutecký, Xu, and Shi (ESA 2020)]. Further, we give the first algorithm that can handle large coefficients in $A, B$ and $C$, that is, it has a running time that depends only polynomially on the encoding length of these coefficients. We obtain these results by extending the $n$-fold integer linear programming algorithm of Cslovjecsek, Koutecký, Lassota, Pilipczuk, and Polak (SODA 2024) to incorporate additional global variables $x_0$. The central technical result is showing that the exhaustive use of the vector rearrangement lemma of Cslovjecsek, Eisenbrand, Pilipczuk, Venzin, and Weismantel (ESA 2021) can be made \emph{affine} by carefully guessing both the residue of the global variables modulo a large modulus and a face in a suitable hyperplane arrangement among a sufficiently small number of candidates. This facilitates a dynamic high-multiplicy encoding of a \emph{faithfully decomposed} $n$-fold ILP with bounded right-hand sides, which we can solve efficiently for each such guess.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum speedups for linear programming via interior point methods](https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.03215v3)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a quantum algorithm based on an interior point method for solving a linear program with $n$ inequality constraints on $d$ variables. The algorithm explicitly returns a feasible solution that is $\varepsilon$-close to optimal, and runs in time $\sqrt{n} \cdot \mathrm{poly}(d,\log(n),\log(1/\varepsilon))$ which is sublinear for tall linear programs (i.e., $n \gg d$). Our algorithm speeds up the Newton step in the state-of-the-art interior point method of Lee and Sidford [FOCS '14]. This requires us to efficiently approximate the Hessian and gradient of the barrier function, and these are our main contributions. To approximate the Hessian, we describe a quantum algorithm for the \emph{spectral approximation} of $A^T A$ for a tall matrix $A \in \mathbb R^{n \times d}$. The algorithm uses leverage score sampling in combination with Grover search, and returns a $δ$-approximation by making $O(\sqrt{nd}/δ)$ row queries to $A$. This generalizes an earlier quantum speedup for graph sparsification by Apers and de Wolf [FOCS '20]. To approximate the gradient, we use a recent quantum algorithm for multivariate mean estimation by Cornelissen, Hamoudi and Jerbi [STOC '22]. While a naive implementation introduces a dependence on the condition number of the Hessian, we avoid this by pre-conditioning our random variable using our quantum algorithm for spectral approximation.</p></details> | 47 pages |

Numerous synthesizers have been developed for program synthesis, offering different approaches to the exponentially growing program space. Although such state-of-the-art tools exist, reusing and adapting them remains tedious and time-consuming. We propose Herb.jl, a unifying program synthesis library written in Julia, to address these issues. Since current methods share similar building blocks, we aim to break down the underlying algorithms into extendable, reusable subcomponents. To demonstrate the benefits of using Herb.jl, we show how to implement a simple problem and grammar, and how to solve it with just a few lines of code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Doc2Spec: Synthesizing Formal Programming Specifications from Natural Language via Grammar Induction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04892v1)** | 2026-01-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring that API implementations and usage comply with natural language programming rules is critical for software correctness, security, and reliability. Formal verification can provide strong guarantees but requires precise specifications, which are difficult and costly to write manually. To address this challenge, we present Doc2Spec, a multi-agent framework that uses LLMs to automatically induce a specification grammar from natural-language rules and then generates formal specifications guided by the induced grammar. The grammar captures essential domain knowledge, constrains the specification space, and enforces consistent representations, thereby improving the reliability and quality of generated specifications. Evaluated on seven benchmarks across three programming languages, Doc2Spec outperforms a baseline without grammar induction and achieves competitive results against a technique with a manually crafted grammar, demonstrating the effectiveness of automated grammar induction for formalizing natural-language rules.</p></details> |  |

However, understanding students' progress can be prohibitively difficult, particularly for multi-faceted problems that include multiple steps with complex interdependencies, have no predictable completion order, or involve evaluation criteria that are difficult to summarize across many students (e.g., exercises building interactive web-based user interfaces). We introduce SPARK, a coding exercise monitoring dashboard designed to address these challenges. SPARK allows instructors to flexibly group substeps into checkpoints based on exercise requirements, suggests automated tests for these checkpoints, and generates visualizations to track progress across steps. SPARK also allows instructors to inspect intermediate outputs, providing deeper insights into solution variations. We also construct a dataset of 40-minute keystroke coding data from N=22 learners solving two web programming exercises and provide empirical insights into the perceived usefulness of SPARK through a within-subjects evaluation with 16 programming instructors.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents an overview of our experience developing a prototype large language model (LLM) integration for the ASTRA programming language. It presents a brief overview of the toolkit, followed by three example implementations, concluding with a discussion of the experiences garnered through the examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable Knapsack and Top-k Operators via Dynamic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21775v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knapsack and Top-k operators are useful for selecting discrete subsets of variables. However, their integration into neural networks is challenging as they are piecewise constant, yielding gradients that are zero almost everywhere. In this paper, we propose a unified framework casting these operators as dynamic programs, and derive differentiable relaxations by smoothing the underlying recursions. On the algorithmic side, we develop efficient parallel algorithms supporting both deterministic and stochastic forward passes, and vector-Jacobian products for the backward pass. On the theoretical side, we prove that Shannon entropy is the unique regularization choice yielding permutation-equivariant operators, and characterize regularizers inducing sparse selections. Finally, on the experimental side, we demonstrate our framework on a decision-focused learning benchmark, a constrained dynamic assortment RL problem, and an extension of discrete VAEs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-objective Integer Linear Programming approach for Automatic Software Cognitive Complexity Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21565v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clear and concise code is necessary to ensure maintainability, so it is crucial that the software is as simple as possible to understand, to avoid bugs and, above all, vulnerabilities. There are many ways to enhance software without changing its functionality, considering the extract method refactoring the primary process to reduce the effort required for code comprehension. The cognitive complexity measure employed in this work is the one defined by SonarSource, which is a company that develops well-known applications for static code analysis. This extraction problem can be modeled as a combinatorial optimization problem. The main difficulty arises from the existence of different criteria for evaluating the solutions obtained, requiring the formulation of the code extraction problem as a multi-objective optimization problem using alternative methods. We propose a multi-objective integer linear programming model to obtain a set of solutions that reduce the cognitive complexity of a given piece of code, such as balancing the number of lines of code and its cognitive complexity. In addition, several algorithms have been developed to validate the model. These algorithms have been integrated into a tool that enables the parameterised resolution of the problem of reducing software cognitive complexity.</p></details> | 51 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Chasing Elusive Memory Bugs in GPU Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.21552v1)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Memory safety bugs, such as out-of-bound accesses (OOB) in GPU programs, can compromise the security and reliability of GPU-accelerated software. We report the existence of input-dependent OOBs in the wild that manifest only under specific inputs. All existing tools to detect OOBs in GPU programs rely on runtime techniques that require an OOB to manifest for detection. Thus, input-dependent OOBs elude them. We also discover intra-allocation OOBs that arise in the presence of logical partitioning of a memory allocation into multiple data structures. Existing techniques are oblivious to the possibility of such OOBs. We make a key observation that the presence (or absence) of semantic relations among program variables, which determines the size of allocations (CPU code) and those calculating offsets into memory allocations (GPU code), helps identify the absence (or presence) of OOBs. We build SCuBA, a first-of-its-kind compile-time technique that analyzes CPU and GPU code to capture such semantic relations (if present). It uses a SAT solver to check if an OOB access is possible under any input, given the captured relations expressed as constraints. It further analyzes GPU code to track logical partitioning of memory allocations for detecting intra-allocation OOB. Compared to NVIDIA's Compute Sanitizer that misses 45 elusive memory bugs across 20 programs, SCuBA misses none with no false alarms.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLMs versus the Halting Problem: Revisiting Program Termination Prediction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.18987v3)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining whether a program terminates is a central problem in computer science. Turing's foundational result established the Halting Problem as undecidable, showing that no algorithm can universally determine termination for all programs and inputs. Consequently, automatic verification tools approximate termination, sometimes failing to prove or disprove; these tools rely on problem-specific architectures and abstractions, and are usually tied to particular programming languages. Recent success and progress in large language models (LLMs) raises the following question: can LLMs reliably predict program termination? In this work, we evaluate LLMs on a diverse set of C programs from the Termination category of the International Competition on Software Verification (SV-Comp) 2025. Our results suggest that LLMs perform remarkably well at predicting program termination, where GPT-5 and Claude Sonnet-4.5 would rank just behind the top-ranked tool (using test-time-scaling), and Code World Model (CWM) would place just behind the second-ranked tool. While LLMs are effective at predicting program termination, they often fail to provide a valid witness as a proof. Moreover, LLMs performance drops as program length increases. We hope these insights motivate further research into program termination and the broader potential of LLMs for reasoning about undecidable problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Abstain and Validate: A Dual-LLM Policy for Reducing Noise in Agentic Program Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03217v2)** | 2026-01-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic Automated Program Repair (APR) is increasingly tackling complex, repository-level bugs in industry, but ultimately these patches still need to be reviewed by a human before committing them to ensure they address the bug. Showing patches unlikely to be accepted can lead to substantial noise, wasting valuable developer time and eroding trust in automated code changes. We introduce two complementary LLM-based policies to reduce such noise: bug abstention and patch validation policies. Bug abstention excludes bugs that the agentic APR system is unlikely to fix. Patch validation rejects patches that are unlikely to be a good fix for the given bug. We evaluate both policies on three sets of bugs from Google's codebase, and their candidate patches generated by an internal agentic APR system. On a set of 174 human-reported bugs, removing bugs and patches rejected by our policies can raise success rates by up to 13 percentage points and 15 percentage points, respectively, and by up to 39 percentage points in combination. On null pointer exceptions and sanitizer-reported bugs with machine-generated bug reports, patch validation also improves average single-sample success rates. This two-policy approach provides a practical path to the reliable, industrial-scale deployment of agentic APR systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2026 IEEE/ACM 48th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Practice (ICSE-SEIP '26)</p></details> |

| **[Hexcute: A Compiler Framework for Automating Layout Synthesis in GPU Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16214v3)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient GPU programming is crucial for achieving high performance in deep learning (DL) applications. The performance of GPU programs depends on how data is parallelized across threads and arranged within memory subsystems. The mapping functions describing tensors on GPUs are known as \emph{tensor layouts}. Low-level programming frameworks, such as CUTLASS and Hidet, provide expressive layout abstractions but often require \emph{considerable programming effort} to manually specify optimal layouts. High-level GPU programming languages, such as Triton, rely on compiler heuristics to generate dataflow, layouts, and pipelining strategies in GPU programs. However, the heuristics for dataflow and pipelining strategies are not generalizable to complex operators. To balance expressiveness and programmability, we propose Hexcute, a compiler framework that automates layout synthesis while providing explicit control over dataflow and pipelining. Hexcute formalizes layout synthesis as a constraint programming problem and solves it with a type-inference-based algorithm. This approach enables systematic exploration of optimal layouts and instructions. Our evaluation shows that Hexcute matches the performance of libraries like cuBLAS and FlashAttention on GEMM, Attention, and their variants, while reducing the amount of code by 1.27$\times$-7.94$\times$ compared to CUTLASS. For mixed-type mixture-of-experts (MoE) operators, Hexcute achieves an average speedup of 6.46$\times$ over Triton. In the end-to-end evaluations of vLLM, Hexcute delivers up to 2.60$\times$ speedup on DeepSeek-R1-AWQ and 2.04$\times$ on a Mamba-based model.</p></details> | 19 pages, 27 figures |
| **[Context-Augmented Code Generation Using Programming Knowledge Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20810v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation but struggle with complex problems. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) mitigates this issue by integrating external knowledge, yet retrieval models often miss relevant context, and generation models hallucinate with irrelevant data. We propose Programming Knowledge Graph (PKG) for semantic representation and fine-grained retrieval of code and text. Our approach enhances retrieval precision through tree pruning and mitigates hallucinations via a re-ranking mechanism that integrates non-RAG solutions. Structuring external data into finer-grained nodes improves retrieval granularity. Evaluations on HumanEval and MBPP show up to 20% pass@1 accuracy gains and a 34% improvement over baselines on MBPP. Our findings demonstrate that our proposed PKG approach along with re-ranker effectively address complex problems while maintaining minimal negative impact on solutions that are already correct without RAG. The replication package is published at https://github.com/iamshahd/ProgrammingKnowledgeGraph</p></details> |  |
| **[Analysis of approximate linear programming solution to Markov decision problem with log barrier function](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19800v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are two primary approaches to solving Markov decision problems (MDPs): dynamic programming based on the Bellman equation and linear programming (LP). Dynamic programming methods are the most widely used and form the foundation of both classical and modern reinforcement learning (RL). By contrast, LP-based methods have been less commonly employed, although they have recently gained attention in contexts such as offline RL. The relative underuse of the LP-based methods stems from the fact that it leads to an inequality-constrained optimization problem, which is generally more challenging to solve effectively compared with Bellman-equation-based methods. The purpose of this paper is to establish a theoretical foundation for solving LP-based MDPs in a more effective and practical manner. Our key idea is to leverage the log-barrier function, widely used in inequality-constrained optimization, to transform the LP formulation of the MDP into an unconstrained optimization problem. This reformulation enables approximate solutions to be obtained easily via gradient descent. While the method may appear simple, to the best of our knowledge, a thorough theoretical interpretation of this approach has not yet been developed. This paper aims to bridge this gap.</p></details> |  |

A central challenge is to maintain scalability when dealing with fine-grained timing constraints, which can significantly exacerbate ASP's grounding bottleneck. To address this issue, we leverage extensions of ASP with difference constraints, a simplified form of linear constraints, to handle time-related aspects externally. Our approach effectively decouples metric ASP from the granularity of time, resulting in a solution that is unaffected by time precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Types for Grassroots Logic Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.17957v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grassroots Logic Programs (GLP) is a concurrent logic programming language in which logic variables are partitioned into paired readers and writers. An assignment is produced at most once via a writer and consumed at most once via its paired reader, and may contain additional readers and/or writers. This enables the concise expression of rich multidirectional communication modalities. ``Logic Programs as Types for Logic Programs'' (LICS'91) defined types as regular sets of paths over derivable ground atoms. Here, we define types to be regular sets of moded paths, where a mode captures directionality of communication -- whether a subterm is consumed from or produced to the environment -- enabling the typing of interactive partial computations including those that eventually deadlock or fail, or never terminate. We provide a syntactic definition of well-typing and prove that a program is well-typed iff the path abstraction of its moded-atom semantics satisfies covariance and contravariance conditions with respect to its type. The GLP type system was implemented in Dart by AI, starting from a mathematical specification of Typed GLP (this paper), deriving from it an English spec (written by AI), and from the spec deriving Dart code (by AI). While GLP is naturally untyped, the motivation for Typed GLP comes from programming with AI: Asking AI to program complex communication modalities in GLP (and in general) and hoping for the best is a tenuous strategy. The emerging discipline we advocate and employ is for the human designer and AI to jointly develop and agree upon (1)~GLP types; (2)~GLP procedure type declarations; (3)~informal (English) descriptions of the procedures; and only then let AI attempt to write (4)~GLP code based on those.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exact Graph Learning via Integer Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20589v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning the dependence structure among variables in complex systems is a central problem across medical, natural, and social sciences. These structures can be naturally represented by graphs, and the task of inferring such graphs from data is known as graph learning or as causal discovery if the graphs are given a causal interpretation. Existing approaches typically rely on restrictive assumptions about the data-generating process, employ greedy oracle algorithms, or solve approximate formulations of the graph learning problem. As a result, they are either sensitive to violations of central assumptions or fail to guarantee globally optimal solutions. We address these limitations by introducing a nonparametric graph learning framework based on nonparametric conditional independence testing and integer programming. We reformulate the graph learning problem as an integer-programming problem and prove that solving the integer-programming problem provides a globally optimal solution to the original graph learning problem. Our method leverages efficient encodings of graphical separation criteria, enabling the exact recovery of larger graphs than was previously feasible. We provide an implementation in the openly available R package 'glip' which supports learning (acyclic) directed (mixed) graphs and chain graphs. From the resulting output one can compute representations of the corresponding Markov equivalence classes or weak equivalence classes. Empirically, we demonstrate that our approach is faster than other existing exact graph learning procedures for a large fraction of instances and graphs of various sizes. GLIP also achieves state-of-the-art performance on simulated data and benchmark datasets across all aforementioned classes of graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Program Logic for Abstract (Hyper)Properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20370v1)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce APPL (Abstract Program Property Logic), a unifying Hoare-style logic that subsumes standard Hoare logic, incorrectness logic, and several variants of Hyper Hoare logic. APPL provides a principled foundation for abstract program logics parameterised by an abstract domain, encompassing both existing and novel abstractions of properties and hyperproperties. The logic is grounded in a semantic framework where the meaning of commands is first defined on a lattice basis and then extended to the full lattice via additivity. Crucially, nondeterministic choice is interpreted by a monoidal operator that need not be idempotent nor coincide with the lattice join. This flexibility allows the framework to capture collecting semantics, various classes of abstract semantics, and hypersemantics. The APPL proof system is sound, and it is relatively complete whenever the property language is sufficiently expressive. When the property language is restricted to an abstract domain, the result is a sound abstract deduction system based on best correct approximations. Relative completeness with respect to a corresponding abstract semantics is recovered provided the abstract domain is complete, in the sense of abstract interpretation, for the monoidal operator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Streaming Tensor Programs: A Streaming Abstraction for Dynamic Parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07776v2)** | 2026-01-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic behaviors are becoming prevalent in tensor applications, like machine learning, where many widely used models contain data-dependent tensor shapes and control flow. However, the limited expressiveness of prior programming abstractions for spatial dataflow accelerators (SDAs) forces these dynamic behaviors to be implemented statically and/or unoptimized. To address these challenges, we present Streaming Tensor Programs (STeP), a streaming abstraction that enables dynamic tensor workloads to run efficiently on SDAs. STeP introduces flexible routing operators, an explicit memory hierarchy, and symbolic-shape semantics that expose dynamic data rates and tensor dimensions. These capabilities unlock new optimizations, like dynamic tiling, dynamic parallelization, and configuration time-multiplexing, that adapt SDA execution to dynamic behaviors while preserving dataflow efficiency. Using a cycle-approximate simulator on representative LLM layers and a full model with real-world traces, STeP enables: dynamic tiling that breaks the Pareto-optimal frontier from prior work, dynamic parallelization that improves latency by ~2.72x, and configuration time-multiplexing that increases compute utilization by ~2.64x over prior SDA abstractions and their implementations.</p></details> |  |

We present CodePilot, a hybrid framework that integrates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with large language models to enable execution-guided program repair for real-world GitHub issues. CodePilot performs hierarchical fault localization from repository to file and function level, explores diverse patch trajectories using MCTS, and leverages execution feedback as a reward signal to guide search and refinement. The framework further incorporates confidence-calibrated generation to selectively refine low-confidence outputs. Experiments on SWE-bench Lite demonstrate that CodePilot achieves a 24.67% issue resolution rate using open-weight models, outperforming comparable baselines. These results suggest that combining symbolic search with neural language models is an effective strategy for scalable, execution-aware software engineering automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.
