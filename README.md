| **[Optimal Locality and Parameter Tradeoffs for Subsystem Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22651v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the tradeoffs between the locality and parameters of subsystem codes. We prove lower bounds on both the number and lengths of interactions in any $D$-dimensional embedding of a subsystem code. Specifically, we show that any embedding of a subsystem code with parameters $[[n,k,d]]$ into $\mathbb{R}^D$ must have at least $M^*$ interactions of length at least $\ell^*$, where \[ M^* = \Omega(\max(k,d)), \quad\text{and}\quad \ell^* = \Omega\bigg(\max\bigg(\frac{d}{n^\frac{D-1}{D}}, \bigg(\frac{kd^\frac{1}{D-1}}{n}\bigg)^\frac{D-1}{D}\bigg)\bigg). \] We also give tradeoffs between the locality and parameters of commuting projector codes in $D$-dimensions, generalizing a result of Dai and Li. We provide explicit constructions of embedded codes that show our bounds are optimal in both the interaction count and interaction length.</p></details> |  |

Benchmarking LLMs as Data Science Code Debuggers for Multi-Hop and Multi-Bug Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22388v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are transforming software development, yet current code generation and code repair benchmarks mainly assess syntactic and functional correctness in simple, single-error cases. LLMs' capabilities to autonomously find and fix runtime logical errors in complex data science code remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce DSDBench: the Data Science Debugging Benchmark, the first benchmark for systematic evaluation of LLMs on multi-hop error tracing and multi-bug detection in data science code debugging. DSDBench adapts datasets from existing data science task benchmarks, such as DABench and MatPlotBench, featuring realistic data science debugging tasks with automatically synthesized multi-hop, multi-bug code snippets. DSDBench includes 1,117 annotated samples with 741 cause-effect error pairs and runtime error messages. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on DSDBench show significant performance gaps, highlighting challenges in debugging logical runtime errors in data science code. DSDBench offers a crucial resource to evaluate and improve LLMs' debugging and reasoning capabilities, enabling more reliable AI-assisted data science in the future.DSDBench is publicly available at https://github.com/KevinCL16/DSDBench.</p></details> | Work in progress |

Their ability to generate human-like text and ensure continuous availability facilitates the creation of interactive service chatbots aimed at enhancing customer experience and streamlining enterprise operations. Despite their potential, LLMs face critical challenges, such as a susceptibility to hallucinations and difficulties handling complex linguistic scenarios, notably code switching and dialectal variations. To address these challenges, this paper describes the design of a multilingual chatbot for Bengali-English customer service interactions utilizing retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and targeted prompt engineering. This research provides valuable insights for the human-computer interaction (HCI) community, emphasizing the importance of designing systems that accommodate linguistic diversity to benefit both customers and businesses. By addressing the intersection of generative AI and cultural heterogeneity, this late-breaking work inspires future innovations in multilingual and multicultural HCI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2025)</p></details> |

Previous highly visible studies have established associations between certain programming languages and energy consumption. A causal misinterpretation of this work has led academics and industry leaders to use or support certain languages based on their claimed impact on energy consumption. This paper tackles this causal question directly. It first corrects and improves the measurement methodology used by prior work. It then develops a detailed causal model capturing the complex relationship between programming language choice and energy consumption. This model identifies and incorporates several critical but previously overlooked factors that affect energy usage. These factors, such as distinguishing programming languages from their implementations, the impact of the application implementations themselves, the number of active cores, and memory activity, can significantly skew energy consumption measurements if not accounted for. We show -- via empirical experiments, improved methodology, and careful examination of anomalies -- that when these factors are controlled for, notable discrepancies in prior work vanish. Our analysis suggests that the choice of programming language implementation has no significant impact on energy consumption beyond execution time.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[QuCheck: A Property-based Testing Framework for Quantum Programs in Qiskit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22641v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Property-based testing has been previously proposed for quantum programs in Q# with QSharpCheck; however, this implementation was limited in functionality, lacked extensibility, and was evaluated on a narrow range of programs using a single property. To address these limitations, we propose QuCheck, an enhanced property-based testing framework in Qiskit. By leveraging Qiskit and the broader Python ecosystem, QuCheck facilitates property construction, introduces flexible input generators and assertions, and supports expressive preconditions. We assessed its effectiveness through mutation analysis on five quantum programs (2-10 qubits), varying the number of properties, inputs, and measurement shots to assess their impact on fault detection and demonstrate the effectiveness of property-based testing across a range of conditions. Results show a strong positive correlation between the mutation score (a measure of fault detection) and number of properties evaluated, with a moderate negative correlation between the false positive rate and number of measurement shots. Among the most thorough test configurations, those evaluating three properties achieved a mean mutation score ranging from 0.90 to 0.92 across all five algorithms, with the false positive rate between 0 and 0.04. QuCheck identified 36.0% more faults than QSharpCheck, with execution time reduced by 81.1%, despite one false positive. These findings underscore the viability of property-based testing for verifying quantum systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Metric Entropy-Free Sample Complexity Bounds for Sample Average Approximation in Convex Stochastic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.00664v6)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies sample average approximation (SAA) in solving convex or strongly convex stochastic programming (SP) problems. In estimating SAA's sample efficiency, the state-of-the-art sample complexity bounds entail metric entropy terms (such as the logarithm of the feasible region's covering number), which often grow polynomially with problem dimensionality. While it has been shown that metric entropy-free complexity rates are attainable under a uniform Lipschitz condition, such an assumption can be overly critical for many important SP problem settings. In response, this paper presents perhaps the first set of metric entropy-free sample complexity bounds for the SAA under standard SP assumptions -- in the absence of the uniform Lipschitz condition. The new results often lead to an $O(d)$-improvement in the complexity rate than the state-of-the-art. From the newly established complexity bounds, an important revelation is that SAA and the canonical stochastic mirror descent (SMD) method, two mainstream solution approaches to SP, entail almost identical rates of sample efficiency, lifting a theoretical discrepancy of SAA from SMD also by the order of $O(d)$. Furthermore, this paper explores non-Lipschitzian scenarios where SAA maintains provable efficacy but the corresponding results for SMD remain mostly unexplored, indicating the potential of SAA's better applicability in some irregular settings. Our numerical experiment results on SAA for solving a simulated SP problem align with our theoretical findings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking LLM Repair Capabilities in Low-Resource Programming Languages Through Cross-Language Translation and Multi-Agent Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22512v1)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in leveraging LLMs for APR have demonstrated impressive capabilities in fixing software defects. However, current LLM-based approaches predominantly focus on mainstream programming languages like Java and Python, neglecting less prevalent but emerging languages such as Rust due to expensive training resources, limited datasets, and insufficient community support. This narrow focus creates a significant gap in repair capabilities across the programming language spectrum, where the full potential of LLMs for comprehensive multilingual program repair remains largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel cross-language program repair approach LANTERN that leverages LLMs' differential proficiency across languages through a multi-agent iterative repair paradigm. Our technique strategically translates defective code from languages where LLMs exhibit weaker repair capabilities to languages where they demonstrate stronger performance, without requiring additional training. A key innovation of our approach is an LLM-based decision-making system that dynamically selects optimal target languages based on bug characteristics and continuously incorporates feedback from previous repair attempts. We evaluate our method on xCodeEval, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 5,068 bugs across 11 programming languages. Results demonstrate significant enhancement in repair effectiveness, particularly for underrepresented languages, with Rust showing a 22.09% improvement in Pass@10 metrics. Our research provides the first empirical evidence that cross-language translation significantly expands the repair capabilities of LLMs and effectively bridges the performance gap between programming languages with different levels of popularity, opening new avenues for truly language-agnostic automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Algebraic Approach to Weighted Answer-set Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20849v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logic programs, more specifically, Answer-set programs, can be annotated with probabilities on facts to express uncertainty. We address the problem of propagating weight annotations on facts (eg probabilities) of an ASP to its standard models, and from there to events (defined as sets of atoms) in a dataset over the program's domain. We propose a novel approach which is algebraic in the sense that it relies on an equivalence relation over the set of events. Uncertainty is then described as polynomial expressions over variables. We propagate the weight function in the space of models and events, rather than doing so within the syntax of the program. As evidence that our approach is sound, we show that certain facts behave as expected. Our approach allows us to investigate weight annotated programs and to determine how suitable a given one is for modeling a given dataset containing events.</p></details> |  |
| **[WRATH: Workload Resilience Across Task Hierarchies in Task-based Parallel Programming Frameworks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12752v2)** | 2025-03-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Failures in Task-based Parallel Programming (TBPP) can severely degrade performance and result in incomplete or incorrect outcomes. Existing failure-handling approaches, including reactive, proactive, and resilient methods such as retry and checkpointing mechanisms, often apply uniform retry mechanisms regardless of the root cause of failures, failing to account for the unique characteristics of TBPP frameworks such as heterogeneous resource availability and task-level failures. To address these limitations, we propose WRATH, a novel systematic approach that categorizes failures based on the unique layered structure of TBPP frameworks and defines specific responses to address failures at different layers. WRATH combines a distributed monitoring system and a resilient module to collaboratively address different types of failures in real time. The monitoring system captures execution and resource information, reports failures, and profiles tasks across different layers of TBPP frameworks. The resilient module then categorizes failures and responds with appropriate actions, such as hierarchically retrying failed tasks on suitable resources. Evaluations demonstrate that WRATH significantly improves TBPP robustness, tripling the task success rate and maintaining an application success rate of over 90% for resolvable failures. Additionally, WRATH can reduce the time to failure by 20%-50%, allowing tasks that are destined to fail to be identified and fail more quickly.</p></details> | Preprint version |
| **[Information Theoretic One-Time Programs from Geometrically Local $\text{QNC}_0$ Adversaries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22016v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show how to construct simulation secure one-time memories, and thus one-time programs, without computational assumptions in the presence of constraints on quantum hardware. Specifically, we build one-time memories from random linear codes and quantum random access codes (QRACs) when constrained to non-adaptive, constant depth, and $D$-dimensional geometrically-local quantum circuit for some constant $D$. We place no restrictions on the adversary's classical computational power, number of qubits it can use, or the coherence time of its qubits. Notably, our construction can still be secure even in the presence of fault tolerant quantum computation as long as the input qubits are encoded in a non-fault tolerant manner (e.g. encoded as high energy states in non-ideal hardware). Unfortunately though, our construction requires decoding random linear codes and thus does not run in polynomial time. We leave open the question of whether one can construct a polynomial time information theoretically secure one-time memory from geometrically local quantum circuits. Of potentially independent interest, we develop a progress bound for information leakage via collision entropy (Renyi entropy of order $2$) along with a few key technical lemmas for a "mutual information" for collision entropies. We also develop new bounds on how much information a specific $2 \mapsto 1$ QRAC can leak about its input, which may be of independent interest as well.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fast Fractional Programming for Multi-Cell Integrated Sensing and Communications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10910v2)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper concerns the coordinate multi-cell beamforming design for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC). In particular, we assume that each base station (BS) has massive antennas. The optimization objective is to maximize a weighted sum of the data rates (for communications) and the Fisher information (for sensing). We first show that the conventional beamforming method for the multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) transmission, i.e., the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm, works for the ISAC problem case from a fractional programming (FP) perspective. However, the WMMSE algorithm frequently requires computing the $N\times N$ matrix inverse, where $N$ is the number of transmit or receive antennas, so the algorithm becomes quite costly when antennas are massively deployed. To address this issue, we develop a nonhomogeneous bound and use it in conjunction with the FP technique to solve the ISAC beamforming problem without the need to invert any large matrices. It is further shown that the resulting new FP algorithm has an intimate connection with gradient projection, based on which we can accelerate the convergence via Nesterov's gradient extrapolation.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Lobster: A GPU-Accelerated Framework for Neurosymbolic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21937v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neurosymbolic programs combine deep learning with symbolic reasoning to achieve better data efficiency, interpretability, and generalizability compared to standalone deep learning approaches. However, existing neurosymbolic learning frameworks implement an uneasy marriage between a highly scalable, GPU-accelerated neural component with a slower symbolic component that runs on CPUs. We propose Lobster, a unified framework for harnessing GPUs in an end-to-end manner for neurosymbolic learning. Lobster maps a general neurosymbolic language based on Datalog to the GPU programming paradigm. This mapping is implemented via compilation to a new intermediate language called APM. The extra abstraction provided by APM allows Lobster to be both flexible, supporting discrete, probabilistic, and differentiable modes of reasoning on GPU hardware with a library of provenance semirings, and performant, implementing new optimization passes. We demonstrate that Lobster programs can solve interesting problems spanning the domains of natural language processing, image processing, program reasoning, bioinformatics, and planning. On a suite of 8 applications, Lobster achieves an average speedup of 5.3x over Scallop, a state-of-the-art neurosymbolic framework, and enables scaling of neurosymbolic solutions to previously infeasible tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining Graph Attention Networks and Distributed Optimization for Multi-Robot Mixed-Integer Convex Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21548v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we develop a fast mixed-integer convex programming (MICP) framework for multi-robot navigation by combining graph attention networks and distributed optimization. We formulate a mixed-integer optimization problem for receding horizon motion planning of a multi-robot system, taking into account the surrounding obstacles. To address the resulting multi-agent MICP problem in real time, we propose a framework that utilizes heterogeneous graph attention networks to learn the latent mapping from problem parameters to optimal binary solutions. Furthermore, we apply a distributed proximal alternating direction method of multipliers algorithm for solving the convex continuous optimization problem. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed framework through experiments conducted on a robotic testbed.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to CDC 2025</p></details> |

Moreover, we construct an initial Elgot category, the morphisms of which coincide with a lightly modified version of Lambek's abacus programs. The partial functions that are strongly representable in this initial Elgot category are precisely the partial recursive ones.</p></details> | <details><summary>In pe...</summary><p>In peer rewview, although not at MFPS, I'm just using their style files!</p></details> |
| **[A Quantum Constraint Generation Framework for Binary Linear Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21222v1)** | 2025-03-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a new approach to utilize quantum computers for binary linear programming (BLP), which can be extended to general integer linear programs (ILP). Quantum optimization algorithms, hybrid or quantum-only, are currently general purpose, standalone solvers for ILP. However, to consider them practically useful, we expect them to overperform the current state of the art classical solvers. That expectation is unfair to quantum algorithms: in classical ILP solvers, after many decades of evolution, many different algorithms work together as a robust machine to get the best result. This is the approach we would like to follow now with our quantum 'solver' solutions. In this study we wrap any suitable quantum optimization algorithm into a quantum informed classical constraint generation framework. First we relax our problem by dropping all constraints and encode it into an Ising Hamiltonian for the quantum optimization subroutine. Then, by sampling from the solution state of the subroutine, we obtain information about constraint violations in the initial problem, from which we decide which coupling terms we need to introduce to the Hamiltonian. The coupling terms correspond to the constraints of the initial binary linear program. Then we optimize over the new Hamiltonian again, until we reach a feasible solution, or other stopping conditions hold. Since one can decide how many constraints they add to the Hamiltonian in a single step, our algorithm is at least as efficient as the (hybrid) quantum optimization algorithm it wraps. We support our claim with results on small scale minimum cost exact cover problem instances.</p></details> |  |
| **[Locally Optimal Solutions for Integer Programming Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20918v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integer programming games (IPGs) are n-person games with integer strategy spaces. These games are used to model non-cooperative combinatorial decision-making and are used in domains such as cybersecurity and transportation. The prevalent solution concept for IPGs, Nash equilibrium, is difficult to compute and even showing whether such an equilibrium exists is known to be Sp2-complete. In this work, we introduce a class of relaxed solution concepts for IPGs called locally optimal integer solutions (LOIS) that are simpler to obtain than pure Nash equilibria. We demonstrate that LOIS are not only faster and more readily scalable in large-scale games but also support desirable features such as equilibrium enumeration and selection. We also show that these solutions can model a broader class of problems including Stackelberg, Stackelberg-Nash, and generalized IPGs. Finally, we provide initial comparative results in a cybersecurity game called the Critical Node game, showing the performance gains of LOIS in comparison to the existing Nash equilibrium solution concept.</p></details> |  |
| **[StepGrade: Grading Programming Assignments with Context-Aware LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20851v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grading programming assignments is a labor-intensive and time-consuming process that demands careful evaluation across multiple dimensions of the code. To overcome these challenges, automated grading systems are leveraged to enhance efficiency and reduce the workload on educators. Traditional automated grading systems often focus solely on correctness, failing to provide interpretable evaluations or actionable feedback for students. This study introduces StepGrade, which explores the use of Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting with Large Language Models (LLMs) as an innovative solution to address these challenges. Unlike regular prompting, which offers limited and surface-level outputs, CoT prompting allows the model to reason step-by-step through the interconnected grading criteria, i.e., functionality, code quality, and algorithmic efficiency, ensuring a more comprehensive and transparent evaluation. This interconnectedness necessitates the use of CoT to systematically address each criterion while considering their mutual influence. To empirically validate the efficiency of StepGrade, we conducted a case study involving 30 Python programming assignments across three difficulty levels (easy, intermediate, and advanced). The approach is validated against expert human evaluations to assess its consistency, accuracy, and fairness. Results demonstrate that CoT prompting significantly outperforms regular prompting in both grading quality and interpretability. By reducing the time and effort required for manual grading, this research demonstrates the potential of GPT-4 with CoT prompting to revolutionize programming education through scalable and pedagogically effective automated grading systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 15th IEEE Integrated STEM Education Conference (ISEC)</p></details> |

We propose a new pedagogy for teaching pointers in the C programming language using graph transformation systems to visually simulate pointer manipulation. In an Introduction to C course, the topic of pointers is often the most difficult one for students to understand; therefore, we experiment with graph-based representations of dynamic pointer structures to reinforce the learning. Groove, a graph transformation tool, is used to illustrate the behaviour of pointers through modelling and simulation. A study is presented to evaluate the effectiveness of the approach. This paper will also provide a comparison to other teaching methods in this area.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings GCM 2023 and 2024, arXiv:2503.19632</p></details> |
| **[Linear-Time Graph Programs without Preconditions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20465v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report on a recent breakthrough in rule-based graph programming, which allows us to reach the time complexity of imperative linear-time algorithms. In general, achieving the complexity of graph algorithms in conventional languages using graph transformation rules is challenging due to the cost of graph matching. Previous work demonstrated that with rooted rules, certain algorithms can be executed in linear time using the graph programming language GP 2. However, for non-destructive algorithms that retain the structure of input graphs, achieving linear runtime required input graphs to be connected and of bounded node degree. In this paper, we overcome these preconditions by enhancing the graph data structure generated by the GP 2 compiler and exploiting the new structure in programs. We present three case studies, a cycle detection program, a program for numbering the connected components of a graph, and a breadth-first search program. Each of these programs runs in linear time on both connected and disconnected input graphs with arbitrary node degrees. We give empirical evidence for the linear time complexity by using timings for various classes of input graphs.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings GCM 2023 and 2024, arXiv:2503.19632. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2501.09144</p></details> |
| **[Benign landscape for Burer-Monteiro factorizations of MaxCut-type semidefinite programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03103v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider MaxCut-type semidefinite programs (SDP) which admit a low rank solution. To numerically leverage the low rank hypothesis, a standard algorithmic approach is the Burer-Monteiro factorization, which allows to significantly reduce the dimensionality of the problem at the cost of its convexity. We give a sharp condition on the conditioning of the Laplacian matrix associated with the SDP under which any second-order critical point of the non-convex problem is a global minimizer. By applying our theorem, we improve on recent results about the correctness of the Burer-Monteiro approach on $\mathbb{Z}_2$-synchronization problems and the Kuramoto model.</p></details> |  |

We argue that successfully deploying AI software engineers requires a level of trust equal to or even greater than the trust established by human-driven software engineering practices. The recent trend toward LLM agents offers a path toward integrating the power of LLMs to create new code with the power of analysis tools to increase trust in the code. This opinion piece comments on whether LLM agents could dominate software engineering workflows in the future and whether the focus of programming will shift from programming at scale to programming with trust.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[Bounded Exhaustive Random Program Generation for Testing Solidity Compilers and Analyzers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20332v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Random program generators often exhibit opportunism: they generate programs without a specific focus within the vast search space defined by the programming language. This opportunistic behavior hinders the effective generation of programs that trigger bugs in compilers and analyzers, even when such programs closely resemble those generated. To address this limitation, we propose bounded exhaustive random program generation, a novel method that focuses the search space of program generation with the aim of more quickly identifying bug-triggering programs. Our approach comprises two stages: 1) generating random program templates, which are incomplete test programs containing bug-related placeholders, and 2) conducting a bounded exhaustive enumeration of valid values for each placeholder within these templates. To ensure efficiency, we maintain a solvable constraint set during the template generation phase and then methodically explore all possible values of placeholders within these constraints during the exhaustive enumeration phase. We have implemented this approach for Solidity, a popular smart contract language for the Ethereum blockchain, in a tool named Erwin. Based on a recent study of Solidity compiler bugs, the placeholders used by Erwin relate to language features commonly associated with compiler bugs. Erwin has successfully identified 23 previously unknown bugs across two Solidity compilers, solc and solang, and one Solidity static analyzer, slither. Evaluation results demonstrate that Erwin outperforms state-of-the-art Solidity fuzzers in bug detection and complements developer-written test suites by covering 4,582 edges and 14,737 lines of the solc compiler that were missed by solc unit tests.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Robot Programming: Mixed Reality Gripper Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02042v2)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional robot programming methods are complex and time-consuming for users. In recent years, alternative approaches such as mixed reality have been explored to address these challenges and optimize robot programming. While the findings of the mixed reality robot programming methods are convincing, most existing methods rely on gesture interaction for robot programming. Since controller-based interactions have proven to be more reliable, this paper examines three controller-based programming methods within a mixed reality scenario: 1) Classical Jogging, where the user positions the robot's end effector using the controller's thumbsticks, 2) Direct Control, where the controller's position and orientation directly corresponds to the end effector's, and 3) Gripper Control, where the controller is enhanced with a 3D-printed gripper attachment to grasp and release objects. A within-subjects study (n = 30) was conducted to compare these methods. The findings indicate that the Gripper Control condition outperforms the others in terms of task completion time, user experience, mental demand, and task performance, while also being the preferred method. Therefore, it demonstrates promising potential as an effective and efficient approach for future robot programming.

Recent studies have explored the idea of applying Chebyshev ball method in optimization theory to solve the case study of PVM; however, the underlying difficulties caused by nonsmoothness have not been addressed. This paper continues the study on this topic, where our main contribution is to establish the relationship between nonsmooth CBF and parametric optimization theory through directional derivatives for the first time, so as to solve PVM problems more conveniently. In detail, inspired by Chebyshev ball approach, a parametric linear program (PLP) based nonsmooth barrier function candidate is established for PVM, and then, sufficient conditions for it to be a nonsmooth CBF are proposed, based on which a quadratic program (QP) based safety filter with guaranteed feasibility is proposed to address PVM problems. Finally, a numerical simulation example is given to show the efficiency of the proposed safety filter.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sim...</summary><p>A simplified version is submitted to CDC2025</p></details> |
| **[Software Vulnerability Analysis Across Programming Language and Program Representation Landscapes: A Survey](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20244v1)** | 2025-03-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software systems are developed in diverse programming languages and often harbor critical vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit to compromise security. These vulnerabilities have been actively targeted in real-world attacks, causing substantial harm to users and cyberinfrastructure. Since many of these flaws originate from the code itself, a variety of techniques have been proposed to detect and mitigate them prior to software deployment. However, a comprehensive comparative study that spans different programming languages, program representations, bug types, and analysis techniques is still lacking. As a result, the relationships among programming languages, abstraction levels, vulnerability types, and detection approaches remain fragmented, and the limitations and research gaps across the landscape are not clearly understood. This article aims to bridge that gap by systematically examining widely used programming languages, levels of program representation, categories of vulnerabilities, and mainstream detection techniques. The survey provides a detailed understanding of current practices in vulnerability discovery, highlighting their strengths, limitations, and distinguishing characteristics. Furthermore, it identifies persistent challenges and outlines promising directions for future research in the field of software security.</p></details> |  |

While traditional GPU programming often relies on low level interfaces like CUDA or SYCL, Triton has emerged as a DSL that offers a more user-friendly and portable alternative by programming at a higher level. The current Triton starts at the workgroup (aka threadblock) level, and directly lowers to per-thread level. And then attempt to coalesce and amend through a series of passes, promoting information from low-level representation. We believe this is pre-mature lowering based on the below observations. 1. GPU has a hierarchical structure both physically and logically. Modern GPUs often feature SIMD units capable of directly operating on tiles on a warp or warpgroup basis, such as blocked load and blocked MMA. 2. Multi-level gradual lowering can make compiler decoupled and clean by separating considerations inter and intra a logical layer. 3. Kernel developers often need fine control to get good performance on the latest hardware. FlashAttention2 advocates explicit data partition between warps to make a performance boost. In this context, we propose ML-Triton which features multi-level compilation flow and programming interface. Our approach begins at the workgroup level and progressively lowers to the warp and intrinsic level, implementing a multilevel lowering align with the hierarchical nature of GPU. Additionally, we extend triton language to support user-set compiler hint and warp level programming, enabling researchers to get good out-of-the box performance without awaiting compiler updates. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves performance above 95% of expert-written kernels on Intel GPU, as measured by the geometric mean.</p></details> |  |

Existing temporal reasoning frameworks operate at the level of models such as traces and automata. Reasoning happens at a very low-level, requiring complex nested (co-)inductive proof techniques and familiarity with proof assistant mechanics (e.g., the guardedness checker). Further, reasoning at the level of models instead of program constructs creates a verification gap that loses the benefits of modularity and composition enjoyed by structural program logics such as Hoare Logic. To address this verification gap, and the lack of compositional proof techniques for temporal specifications, we propose Ticl, a new structural temporal logic. Using ticl, we encode complex (co-)inductive proof techniques as structural lemmas and focus our reasoning on variants and invariants. We show that it is possible to perform compositional proofs of general temporal properties in a proof assistant, while working at a high level of abstraction. We demonstrate the benefits of Ticl by giving mechanized proofs of safety and liveness properties for programs with scheduling, concurrent shared memory, and distributed consensus, demonstrating a low proof-to-code ratio.</p></details> |  |

| **[HoarePrompt: Structural Reasoning About Program Correctness in Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19599v1)** | 2025-03-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While software requirements are often expressed in natural language, verifying the correctness of a program against natural language requirements is a hard and underexplored problem. Large language models (LLMs) are promising candidates for addressing this challenge, however our experience shows that they are ineffective in this task, often failing to detect even straightforward bugs. To address this gap, we introduce HoarePrompt, a novel approach that adapts fundamental ideas from program analysis and verification to natural language artifacts. Drawing inspiration from the strongest postcondition calculus, HoarePrompt employs a systematic, step-by-step process in which an LLM generates natural language descriptions of reachable program states at various points in the code. To manage loops, we propose few-shot-driven k-induction, an adaptation of the k-induction method widely used in model checking. Once program states are described, HoarePrompt leverages the LLM to assess whether the program, annotated with these state descriptions, conforms to the natural language requirements. For evaluating the quality of classifiers of program correctness with respect to natural language requirements, we constructed CoCoClaNeL, a challenging dataset of solutions to programming competition problems. Our experiments show that HoarePrompt improves the MCC by 62% compared to directly using Zero-shot-CoT prompts for correctness classification. Furthermore, HoarePrompt outperforms a classifier that assesses correctness via LLM-based test generation by increasing the MCC by 93%. The inductive reasoning mechanism contributes a 28% boost to MCC, underscoring its effectiveness in managing loops.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces TrackThinkDashboard, an application designed to visualize the learning workflow by integrating web browsing and programming logs into one unified view. The system aims to (1) help students monitor and reflect on their problem-solving processes, identify knowledge gaps, and cultivate effective SRL strategies; and (2) enable teachers to identify at-risk learners more effectively and provide targeted, data-driven guidance. We conducted a study with 33 participants (32 male, 1 female) from Japanese universities, including individuals with and without prior programming experience, to explore differences in web browsing and coding patterns. The dashboards revealed multiple learning approaches, such as trial-and-error and trial-and-search methods, and highlighted how domain knowledge influenced the overall activity flow. We discuss how this visualization tool can be used continuously or in one-off experiments, consider associated privacy implications, and explore opportunities for expanding data sources to gain richer behavioral insights.</p></details> |  |

This paper evaluates the capabilities of the Llama 2-70B model in automating these tasks for scientific applications written in commonly used programming languages. Using representative test problems, we assess the model's capacity to generate code, documentation, and unit tests, as well as its ability to translate existing code between commonly used programming languages. Our comprehensive analysis evaluates the compilation, runtime behavior, and correctness of the generated and translated code. Additionally, we assess the quality of automatically generated code, documentation and unit tests. Our results indicate that while Llama 2-70B frequently generates syntactically correct and functional code for simpler numerical tasks, it encounters substantial difficulties with more complex, parallelized, or distributed computations, requiring considerable manual corrections. We identify key limitations and suggest areas for future improvements to better leverage AI-driven automation in scientific computing workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[High Probability Complexity Bounds of Trust-Region Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming with Heavy-Tailed Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19091v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider nonlinear optimization problems with a stochastic objective and deterministic equality constraints. We propose a Trust-Region Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming (TR-SSQP) method and establish its high-probability iteration complexity bounds for identifying first- and second-order $\epsilon$-stationary points. In our algorithm, we assume that exact objective values, gradients, and Hessians are not directly accessible but can be estimated via zeroth-, first-, and second-order probabilistic oracles. Compared to existing complexity studies of SSQP methods that rely on a zeroth-order oracle with sub-exponential tail noise (i.e., light-tailed) and focus mostly on first-order stationarity, our analysis accommodates irreducible and heavy-tailed noise in the zeroth-order oracle and significantly extends the analysis to second-order stationarity. We show that under weaker noise conditions, our method achieves the same high-probability first-order iteration complexity bounds, while also exhibiting promising second-order iteration complexity bounds. Specifically, the method identifies a first-order $\epsilon$-stationary point in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations and a second-order $\epsilon$-stationary point in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ iterations with high probability, provided that $\epsilon$ is lower bounded by a constant determined by the irreducible noise level in estimation. We validate our theoretical findings and evaluate the practical performance of our method on CUTEst benchmark test set.</p></details> | 50 pages, 5 figures |

Given the English description of a programming problem and a set of unit tests, the model's goal is to synthesize the correct program that solves the problem and passes the tests. QualityFlow includes large language model (LLM) agents resembling a software development team, including code generation, testing, and self-debugging. We propose the LLM Quality Checker, which explicitly "imagines" whether the synthesized programs' execution would conform to the unit tests. The Quality Checks dynamically control the workflow, including actions to submit the final answer, clarify the problem statement, and revert previous workflow steps. Our experiments show that the Quality Checker can precisely accept any correct program, mitigate faulty synthesized tests, and prevent potential workflow deviation. QualityFlow establishes the state-of-the-art results on four program synthesis benchmarks: MBPP, HumanEval, and stricter evaluations from MBPP-EvalPlus and HumanEval-EvalPlus.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coding Malware in Fancy Programming Languages for Fun and Profit](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19058v1)** | 2025-03-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The continuous increase in malware samples, both in sophistication and number, presents many challenges for organizations and analysts, who must cope with thousands of new heterogeneous samples daily. This requires robust methods to quickly determine whether a file is malicious. Due to its speed and efficiency, static analysis is the first line of defense. In this work, we illustrate how the practical state-of-the-art methods used by antivirus solutions may fail to detect evident malware traces. The reason is that they highly depend on very strict signatures where minor deviations prevent them from detecting shellcodes that otherwise would immediately be flagged as malicious. Thus, our findings illustrate that malware authors may drastically decrease the detections by converting the code base to less-used programming languages. To this end, we study the features that such programming languages introduce in executables and the practical issues that arise for practitioners to detect malicious activity.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in CODASPY 2025</p></details> |

Typical training data for programming languages consist of real program demonstrations coupled with human-written comments. Here we present novel approaches to the creation of such data for low resource programming languages. We generate fully-synthetic, textbook-quality demonstrations of common library functions in an example domain of Excel formulas, using a teacher model. We then finetune an underperforming student model, and show improvement on 2 question-answering datasets recast into the Excel domain. We show advantages of finetuning over standard, off-the-shelf RAG approaches, which can offer only modest improvement due to the unfamiliar target domain.</p></details> |  |

With the creation of the software and the urging interest of people to learn to write software, there is a large collection of source codes that can be found on the web, also known as Big Code, which can be used as a source of data for driving the machine learning applications tending to solve certain software engineering problems. In this paper, we present COFO, a dataset consisting of 809 classes/problems with a total of 369K source codes written in C, C++, Java, and Python programming languages, along with other metadata such as code tags, problem specification, and input-output specifications. COFO has been scraped from the openly available Codeforces website using a selenium-beautifulsoup-python based scraper. We envision that this dataset can be useful for solving machine learning-based problems like program classification/recognition, tagging, predicting program properties, and code comprehension.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Constraint Programming (CP) and Temporal Networks have reinvoked interest in evaluating the advantages and drawbacks of various proactive and reactive scheduling methods. First, we present a new, CP-based fully proactive method. Second, we show how a reactive approach can be constructed using an online rescheduling procedure. A third contribution is based on partial order schedules and uses Simple Temporal Networks with Uncertainty (STNUs). Our statistical analysis shows that the STNU-based algorithm performs best in terms of solution quality, while also showing good relative offline and online computation time.</p></details> |  |
| **[ROCODE: Integrating Backtracking Mechanism and Program Analysis in Large Language Models for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.07112v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive performance in code generation recently, offering programmers revolutionary assistance in software development. However, due to the auto-regressive nature of LLMs, they are susceptible to error accumulation during code generation. Once an error is produced, LLMs can merely continue to generate the subsequent code conditioned on it, given their inability to adjust previous outputs. Existing LLM-based approaches typically consider post-revising after code generation, leading to the challenging resolution of accumulated errors and the significant wastage of resources. Ideally, LLMs should rollback and resolve the occurred error in time during code generation, rather than proceed on the basis of the error and wait for post-revising after generation. In this paper, we propose ROCODE, which integrates the backtracking mechanism and program analysis into LLMs for code generation. Specifically, we employ program analysis to perform incremental error detection during the generation process. When an error is detected, the backtracking mechanism is triggered to priming rollback strategies and constraint regeneration, thereby eliminating the error early and ensuring continued generation on the correct basis. Experiments on multiple code generation benchmarks show that ROCODE can significantly reduce the errors generated by LLMs, with a compilation pass rate of 99.1%. The test pass rate is improved by up to 23.8% compared to the best baseline approach. Compared to the post-revising baseline, the token cost is reduced by 19.3%. Moreover, our approach is model-agnostic and achieves consistent improvements across nine representative LLMs.</p></details> | ICSE 2025 |
| **[RustMap: Towards Project-Scale C-to-Rust Migration via Program Analysis and LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.17741v1)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Migrating existing C programs into Rust is increasingly desired, as Rust offers superior memory safety while maintaining C's high performance. However, vastly different features between C and Rust--e.g., distinct definitions and usages of pointers and references--pose significant challenges beyond mere syntactic translation. Existing automated translation tools, such as C2Rust, may rely too much on syntactic, template-based translation and generate unsafe Rust code that is hard for human developers to read, maintain, or even compile. More semantic-aware translation that produces safer, idiomatic, and runnable Rust code is much needed. This paper introduces a novel dependency-guided and large language model (LLM)-based C-to-Rust translation approach, RustMap, based on three key ideas: (1) Utilize LLM capabilities to produce idiomatic Rust code from given small pieces of C code, (2) Mitigate LLM limitations in handling large codebases by breaking project-scale C programs into smaller units for translation according to their usage dependencies and composing them into a runnable Rust program, and (3) Enhance the correctness of the translated Rust program by using test cases to check input/output equivalence, isolate faulty code when execution states deviate, and iteratively refine the translation using feedback from compilation and test errors. We empirically evaluate RustMap on 126 real-world programs, including 125 from Rosetta Code and a 7000+ line bzip2 implementation using GPT-4o as the LLM. RustMap shows promising results, guiding GPT-4o to produce idiomatic, readable, and functional Rust code with significantly less unsafe code than other tools, and revealing non-trivial translation patterns reusable for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpecEval: Evaluating Code Comprehension in Large Language Models via Program Specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12866v2)** | 2025-03-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language models have achieved impressive performance in automated software engineering. Extensive efforts have been made to evaluate the abilities of code LLMs in various aspects, with an increasing number of benchmarks and evaluation frameworks proposed. Apart from the most sought-after capability of code generation, the capability of code comprehension is being granted growing attention. Nevertheless, existing works assessing the code comprehension capability of LLMs exhibit varied limitations. Evaluation frameworks like CRUXEval and REval usually focus on code reasoning tasks over a certain input case, leading to a limited range of execution traces covered, resulting in a loss in code semantics examined and the inability to assess the comprehensive understanding of LLMs concerning the target program. To tackle these challenges, we propose SpecEval, a novel black-box evaluation framework to evaluate code comprehension in LLMs via program specifications. Inspired by the idea that specifications can act as a comprehensive articulation of program behaviors concerning all possible execution traces, we employ formalized program specifications to represent program semantics and perform comprehensive evaluations. In particular, four specification-related tasks are designed meticulously to assess the capability of LLMs from basic to advanced levels. Counterfactual analysis is further conducted to study the performance variance of LLMs under semantics-preserving perturbations. Systematic experiments are conducted on six state-of-the-art LLMs. Extensive experimental results present a below-satisfactory performance of LLMs on specification-related tasks, revealing the limitations of existing LLMs in terms of articulating program semantics with formal specifications. Counterfactual analysis also reveals the sensitivity of LLMs towards semantic-preserving perturbations.</p></details> |  |

Programming Protocol-Independent Packet Processors (P4) has become the most widely adopted abstraction, programming language, and framework for data plane programming. However, existing simulation platforms lack high-performance support for P4-based networks. This paper introduces P4sim, a high-performance P4-driven simulation framework built on bmv2 and NS4, seamlessly integrated with ns-3. It improves queue modeling, time scheduling, and P4 architecture support, extending compatibility to V1model, PSA, and PNA. P4sim enables efficient packet processing, accurate time tracking, and seamless interaction between P4-enabled hosts and switches. We evaluate the P4sim in terms of performance and queue management and demonstrate its capabilities using two common use cases: Basic Tunneling and Load Balancing. The results highlight the P4sim as a powerful tool for advancing research and education in programmable networks.</p></details> | 9 pages, 8 figures |

Recent studies often struggle to simultaneously identify unexpected failures reactively after they occur and prevent foreseeable ones proactively. To this end, we propose Code-as-Monitor (CaM), a novel paradigm leveraging the vision-language model (VLM) for both open-set reactive and proactive failure detection. The core of our method is to formulate both tasks as a unified set of spatio-temporal constraint satisfaction problems and use VLM-generated code to evaluate them for real-time monitoring. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of monitoring, we further introduce constraint elements that abstract constraint-related entities or their parts into compact geometric elements. This approach offers greater generality, simplifies tracking, and facilitates constraint-aware visual programming by leveraging these elements as visual prompts. Experiments show that CaM achieves a 28.7% higher success rate and reduces execution time by 31.8% under severe disturbances compared to baselines across three simulators and a real-world setting. Moreover, CaM can be integrated with open-loop control policies to form closed-loop systems, enabling long-horizon tasks in cluttered scenes with dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by CVPR 2025.

Poor or inconsistent choices can lead to increased technical debt, security vulnerabilities, and even catastrophic failures in safety-critical systems. As Large Language Models (LLMs) play an increasing role in code generation, it is essential to understand how they make these decisions. However, little is known about their preferences when selecting programming languages and libraries for different coding tasks. To fill this gap, this study provides the first in-depth investigation into LLM preferences for programming languages and libraries used when generating code. We assess the preferences of eight diverse LLMs by prompting them to complete various coding tasks, including widely-studied benchmarks and the more practical task of generating the initial structural code for new projects (a crucial step that often determines a project's language or library choices). Our findings reveal that LLMs heavily favour Python when solving language-agnostic problems, using it in 90%-97% of cases for benchmark tasks. Even when generating initial project code where Python is not a suitable language, it remains the most-used language in 58% of instances. Moreover, LLMs contradict their own language recommendations in 83% of project initialisation tasks, raising concerns about their reliability in guiding language selection. Similar biases toward well-established libraries further create serious discoverability challenges for newer open-source projects. These results highlight the need to improve LLMs' adaptability to diverse programming contexts and to develop mechanisms for mitigating programming language and library bias.</p></details> | 12 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Parallel Domain-Decomposition Algorithms for Complexity Certification of Branch-and-Bound Algorithms for Mixed-Integer Linear and Quadratic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16411v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When implementing model predictive control (MPC) for hybrid systems with a linear or a quadratic performance measure, a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) or a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) needs to be solved, respectively, at each sampling instant. Recent work has introduced the possibility to certify the computational complexity of branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithms when solving MILP and MIQP problems formulated as multi-parametric MILPs (mp-MILPs) and mp-MIQPs. Such a framework allows for computing the worst-case computational complexity of standard B&B-based MILP and MIQP solvers, quantified by metrics such as the total number of LP/QP iterations and B&B nodes. These results are highly relevant for real-time hybrid MPC applications. In this paper, we extend this framework by developing parallel, domain-decomposition versions of the previously proposed algorithm, allowing it to scale to larger problem sizes and enable the use of high-performance computing (HPC) resources. Furthermore, to reduce peak memory consumption, we introduce two modifications to the existing (serial) complexity certification framework, integrating them into the proposed parallel algorithms. Numerical experiments show that the parallel algorithms significantly reduce computation time while maintaining the correctness of the original framework.</p></details> |  |

In its current implementation, DIDP guides the search using user-defined dual bounds. Reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly being applied to combinatorial optimization problems and shares several key structures with DP, being represented by the Bellman equation and state-based transition systems. We propose using reinforcement learning to obtain a heuristic function to guide the search in DIDP. We develop two RL-based guidance approaches: value-based guidance using Deep Q-Networks and policy-based guidance using Proximal Policy Optimization. Our experiments indicate that RL-based guidance significantly outperforms standard DIDP and problem-specific greedy heuristics with the same number of node expansions. Further, despite longer node evaluation times, RL guidance achieves better run-time performance than standard DIDP on three of four benchmark domains.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 4 figures, to be published in CPAIOR 2025 (https://sites.google.com/view/cpaior2025)</p></details> |

However, discovering such insightful equations from data presents significant challenges due to the necessity of navigating extremely large combinatorial hypothesis spaces. Current methods of equation discovery, commonly known as symbolic regression techniques, largely focus on extracting equations from data alone, often neglecting the domain-specific prior knowledge that scientists typically depend on. They also employ limited representations such as expression trees, constraining the search space and expressiveness of equations. To bridge this gap, we introduce LLM-SR, a novel approach that leverages the extensive scientific knowledge and robust code generation capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to discover scientific equations from data. Specifically, LLM-SR treats equations as programs with mathematical operators and combines LLMs' scientific priors with evolutionary search over equation programs. The LLM iteratively proposes new equation skeleton hypotheses, drawing from its domain knowledge, which are then optimized against data to estimate parameters. We evaluate LLM-SR on four benchmark problems across diverse scientific domains (e.g., physics, biology), which we carefully designed to simulate the discovery process and prevent LLM recitation. Our results demonstrate that LLM-SR discovers physically accurate equations that significantly outperform state-of-the-art symbolic regression baselines, particularly in out-of-domain test settings. We also show that LLM-SR's incorporation of scientific priors enables more efficient equation space exploration than the baselines.

These optimization problems often take the form of mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) or mixed-integer quadratic programs (MIQPs) that depend on system parameters. A common approach for solving such problems is the branch-and-bound (B&B) method. This paper extends existing complexity certification methods by presenting a unified complexity-certification framework for B&B-based MILP and MIQP solvers, specifically for the family of multi-parametric MILP and MIQP problems that arise in, e.g., hybrid MPC applications. The framework provides guarantees on worst-case computational measures, including the maximum number of iterations or relaxations B&B algorithms require to reach optimality. It systematically accounts for different branching and node selection strategies, as well as heuristics integrated into B&B, ensuring a comprehensive certification framework. By offering theoretical guarantees and practical insights for solver customization, the proposed framework enhances the reliability of B&B for real-time application. The usefulness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through numerical experiments on both random MILPs and MIQPs, as well as on MIQPs arising from a hybrid MPC problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Binary-Integer-Programming Based Algorithm for Expert Load Balancing in Mixture-of-Experts Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15451v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For pre-training of MoE (Mixture-of-Experts) models, one of the main issues is unbalanced expert loads, which may cause routing collapse or increased computational overhead. Existing methods contain the Loss-Controlled method and the Loss-Free method, where both the unbalanced degrees at first several training steps are still high and decrease slowly. In this work, we propose BIP-Based Balancing, an expert load balancing algorithm based on binary integer programming (BIP). The algorithm maintains an additional vector q on each MoE layer that can help change the top-K order of s by solving a binary integer programming with very small time costs. We implement the algorithm on two MoE language models: 16-expert (0.3B) and 64-expert (1.1B). The experimental results show that on both models comparing with the Loss-Controlled method and the Loss-Free method, our algorithm trains models with the lowest perplexities, while saves at least 13% of pre-training time compared with the Loss-Controlled method. Within our current knowledge, this is the first routing algorithm that achieves maintaining load balance status on every expert in every MoE layer from the first step to the last step during the whole pre-training process, while the trained MoE models also perform well. The code material of this work is available at https://github.com/sunyuanLLM/bip_routing_algorithm.</p></details> |  |

ExeDec, a state-of-the-art program synthesis framework, employs this approach by combining a Subgoal Model for decomposition and a Synthesizer Model for program generation to facilitate compositional generalization. In this work, we develop REGISM, an adaptation of ExeDec that removes decomposition guidance and relies solely on iterative execution-driven synthesis. By comparing these two exemplary approaches-ExeDec, which leverages task decomposition, and REGISM, which does not-we investigate the interplay between task decomposition and program generation. Our findings indicate that ExeDec exhibits significant advantages in length generalization and concept composition tasks, likely due to its explicit decomposition strategies. At the same time, REGISM frequently matches or surpasses ExeDec's performance across various scenarios, with its solutions often aligning more closely with ground truth decompositions. These observations highlight the importance of repeated execution-guided synthesis in driving task-solving performance, even within frameworks that incorporate explicit decomposition strategies. Our analysis suggests that task decomposition approaches like ExeDec hold significant potential for advancing program synthesis, though further work is needed to clarify when and why these strategies are most effective.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2025 Workshop Deep Learning for Code</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Local Selection: Global Cut Selection for Enhanced Mixed-Integer Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15847v1)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mixed-integer programming (MIP) solvers, cutting planes are essential for Branch-and-Cut (B&C) algorithms as they reduce the search space and accelerate the solving process. Traditional methods rely on hard-coded heuristics for cut plane selection but fail to leverage problem-specific structural features. Recent machine learning approaches use neural networks for cut selection but focus narrowly on the efficiency of single-node within the B&C algorithm, without considering the broader contextual information. To address this, we propose Global Cut Selection (GCS), which uses a bipartite graph to represent the search tree and combines graph neural networks with reinforcement learning to develop cut selection strategies. Unlike prior methods, GCS applies cutting planes across all nodes, incorporating richer contextual information. Experiments show GCS significantly improves solving efficiency for synthetic and large-scale real-world MIPs compared to traditional and learning-based methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Stability of Undesirable Equilibria in the Quadratic Program Framework for Safety-Critical Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08027v2)** | 2025-03-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) have been used to develop provably safe controllers by means of quadratic programs (QPs). This framework guarantees safety in the form of trajectory invariance with respect to a given set, but it can introduce undesirable equilibrium points to the closed loop system, which can be asymptotically stable. In this work, we present a detailed study of the formation and stability of equilibrium points with the CLF-CBF-QP framework with multiple CBFs. In particular, we prove that undesirable equilibrium points occur for most systems, and their stability is dependent on the CLF and CBF geometrical properties. We introduce the concept of CLF-CBF compatibility for a system, regarding a CLF-CBF pair inducing no stable equilibrium points other than the CLF global minimum on the corresponding closed-loop dynamics. Sufficient conditions for CLF-CBF compatibility for LTI and drift-less full-rank systems with quadratic CLF and CBFs are derived, and we propose a novel control strategy to induce smooth changes in the CLF geometry at certain regions of the state space in order to satisfy the CLF-CBF compatibility conditions, aiming to achieve safety with respect to multiple safety objectives and quasi-global convergence of the trajectories towards the CLF minimum. Numeric simulations illustrate the applicability of the proposed method.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IFAC Automatica. Under review</p></details> |

These archetypes encapsulate spatial relationships between data entities and execution flow in a structured manner, enabling more expressive and semantically rich computations over interconnected data structures. By formalizing the relationships between data elements in space, our approach allows for more intuitive modeling of complex systems where the topology of connections is essential to the underlying computational model.

Our applications include (i) certifying whether auxiliary qubits can be safely disposed of, (ii) determining if a system is separable across a given bipartition, (iii) checking the transversality of a gate with respect to a given stabilizer code, and (iv) computing post-measurement states for computational basis measurements. Further, this logic is extended to accommodate universal quantum computing by deriving Hoare triples for the $T$-gate, multiply-controlled unitaries such as the Toffoli gate, and some gate injection circuits that use associated magic states. A number of interesting results emerge from this logic, including a lower bound on the number of $T$ gates necessary to perform a multiply-controlled $Z$ gate.</p></details> | 52 pages, 3 figures |

Within the graphics community, generating procedural 3D models has shifted to using node graph systems. They allow the artist to create complex shapes and animations through visual programming. Being a high-level design tool, they made procedural 3D modeling more accessible. However, crafting those node graphs demands expertise and training. We present GeoCode, a novel framework designed to extend an existing node graph system and significantly lower the bar for the creation of new procedural 3D shape programs. Our approach meticulously balances expressiveness and generalization for part-based shapes. We propose a curated set of new geometric building blocks that are expressive and reusable across domains. We showcase three innovative and expressive programs developed through our technique and geometric building blocks. Our programs enforce intricate rules, empowering users to execute intuitive high-level parameter edits that seamlessly propagate throughout the entire shape at a lower level while maintaining its validity. To evaluate the user-friendliness of our geometric building blocks among non-experts, we conducted a user study that demonstrates their ease of use and highlights their applicability across diverse domains. Empirical evidence shows the superior accuracy of GeoCode in inferring and recovering 3D shapes compared to an existing competitor. Furthermore, our method demonstrates superior expressiveness compared to alternatives that utilize coarse primitives. Notably, we illustrate the ability to execute controllable local and global shape manipulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>proje...</summary><p>project page: https://threedle.github.io/GeoCode/</p></details> |
| **[Combining Static Analysis Techniques for Program Comprehension Using Slicito](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15675v1)** | 2025-03-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While program comprehension tools often use static program analysis techniques to obtain useful information, they usually work only with sufficiently scalable techniques with limited precision. A possible improvement of this approach is to let the developer interactively reduce the scope of the code being analyzed and then apply a more precise analysis technique to the reduced scope. This paper presents a new version of the tool SLICITO that allows developers to perform this kind of exploration on C# code in Visual Studio. A common usage of SLICITO is to use interprocedural data-flow analysis to identify the parts of the code most relevant for the given task and then apply symbolic execution to reason about the precise behavior of these parts. Inspired by Moldable Development, SLICITO provides a set of program analysis and visualization building blocks that can be used to create specialized program comprehension tools directly in Visual Studio. We demonstrate the full scope of features on a real industrial example both in the text and in the following video: https://www.slicito.com/icpc2025video.mp4</p></details> |  |

Latency, bandwidth constraints, and the heterogeneity of edge environments hinder the efficiency of centralized cloud solutions. While major cloud providers extend their platforms to the edge, these approaches often overlook its unique characteristics, limiting its potential. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Radon, a flexible programming model and platform designed for the edge-to-cloud continuum. Radon applications are structured as atoms, isolated stateful entities that communicate through messaging and can be composed into complex systems. The Radon runtime, based on WebAssembly (WASM), enables language- and deployment-independent execution, ensuring portability and adaptability across heterogeneous environments. This decoupling allows developers to focus on application logic while the runtime optimizes for diverse infrastructure conditions. We present a prototype implementation of Radon and evaluate its effectiveness through a distributed key-value store case study. We analyze the implementation in terms of code complexity and performance. Our results demonstrate that Radon facilitates the development and operation of scalable applications across the edge-to-cloud continuum advancing the current state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to EDCCS 2025</p></details> |

However, achieving high geometric precision and editability requires representing figures as graphics programs in languages like TikZ, and aligned training data (i.e., graphics programs with captions) remains scarce. Meanwhile, large amounts of unaligned graphics programs and captioned raster images are more readily available. We reconcile these disparate data sources by presenting TikZero, which decouples graphics program generation from text understanding by using image representations as an intermediary bridge. It enables independent training on graphics programs and captioned images and allows for zero-shot text-guided graphics program synthesis during inference. We show that our method substantially outperforms baselines that can only operate with caption-aligned graphics programs. Furthermore, when leveraging caption-aligned graphics programs as a complementary training signal, TikZero matches or exceeds the performance of much larger models, including commercial systems like GPT-4o. Our code, datasets, and select models are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://github.com/potamides/DeTikZify</p></details> |

This work addresses profiling specifically in the context of code datasets for Large Language Models (code-LLMs), where data quality directly influences tasks such as code generation and summarization. Characterizing code datasets in terms of programming language concepts enables better insights and targeted data curation. Our proposed methodology decomposes code data profiling into two phases: (1) an offline phase where LLMs are leveraged to derive and learn rules for extracting syntactic and semantic concepts across various programming languages, including previously unseen or low-resource languages, and (2) an online deterministic phase applying these derived rules for efficient real-time analysis. This hybrid approach is customizable, extensible to new syntactic and semantic constructs, and scalable to multiple languages. Experimentally, our LLM-aided method achieves a mean accuracy of 90.33% for syntactic extraction rules and semantic classification accuracies averaging 80% and 77% across languages and semantic concepts, respectively.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[Assessing Large Language Models for Automated Feedback Generation in Learning Programming Problem Solving](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14630v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Providing effective feedback is important for student learning in programming problem-solving. In this sense, Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as potential tools to automate feedback generation. However, their reliability and ability to identify reasoning errors in student code remain not well understood. This study evaluates the performance of four LLMs (GPT-4o, GPT-4o mini, GPT-4-Turbo, and Gemini-1.5-pro) on a benchmark dataset of 45 student solutions. We assessed the models' capacity to provide accurate and insightful feedback, particularly in identifying reasoning mistakes. Our analysis reveals that 63\% of feedback hints were accurate and complete, while 37\% contained mistakes, including incorrect line identification, flawed explanations, or hallucinated issues. These findings highlight the potential and limitations of LLMs in programming education and underscore the need for improvements to enhance reliability and minimize risks in educational applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Engineering Scientific Assistants using Interactive Structured Induction of Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14488v1)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We are interested in the construction of software that can act as scientific assistants to domain specialists. It is expected that such assistants will be needed to accelerate the identification of ways to address complex problems requiring urgent solutions. In this paper, our focus is not on a specific scientific problem, but on the software-engineering of such 'science accelerators'. Recent developments in 'No Code' techniques would seem to suggest that scientist can simply hypothesise solutions simply by conversing with a large language model (LLM). However, for complex scientific problems, this seems unlikely given the current state of LLM technology. What does appear feasible is that a software engineer can use LLMs to rapidly construct programs for use by a domain-specialist, including the specialist's requirements expressed in natural language. We propose the design of an interactive form of 'structured' inductive programming in which a software-engineer and an LLM collaboratively construct an 'assistant' for a scientific data analysis. The paper describes a simple implementation called iStrucInd that adapts a '2-way Intelligibility' protocol to implement the interaction between the software engineer and the LLM. We test the tool on two different non-trivial scientific data analysis tasks. Specifically, we compare the system constructed by iStrucInd against systems constructed manually and by Low Code/No Code methods along dimensions of: (a) program performance; (b) program quality; and (c) programming effort. The results show iStrucInd allows a software engineer to develop better programs faster suggesting interactive structured induction can play a useful role in the rapid construction of scientific assistants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Programming-Based Offline Redundancy Resolution of Redundant Manipulators Along Prescribed Paths with Real-Time Adjustment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17052v2)** | 2025-03-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional offline redundancy resolution of trajectories for redundant manipulators involves computing inverse kinematic solutions for Cartesian space paths, constraining the manipulator to a fixed path without real-time adjustments. Online redundancy resolution can achieve real-time adjustment of paths, but it cannot consider subsequent path points, leading to the possibility of the manipulator being forced to stop mid-motion due to joint constraints. To address this, this paper introduces a dynamic programming-based offline redundancy resolution for redundant manipulators along prescribed paths with real-time adjustment. The proposed method allows the manipulator to move along a prescribed path while implementing real-time adjustment along the normal to the path. Using Dynamic Programming, the proposed approach computes a global maximum for the variation of adjustment coefficients. As long as the coefficient variation between adjacent sampling path points does not exceed this limit, the algorithm provides the next path point's joint angles based on the current joint angles, enabling the end-effector to achieve the adjusted Cartesian pose. The main innovation of this paper lies in augmenting traditional offline optimal planning with real-time adjustment capabilities, achieving a fusion of offline planning and online planning.</p></details> |  |

Despite these promising results on competitive benchmarks, they still struggle with seemingly simple problem-solving tasks typically carried out by elementary-level students. How do state-of-the-art models perform on standardized programming-related tests designed to assess computational thinking and problem-solving skills at schools? In this paper, we curate a novel benchmark involving computational thinking tests grounded in elementary visual programming domains. Our initial results show that state-of-the-art models like GPT-4o and Llama3 barely match the performance of an average school student. To further boost the performance of these models, we fine-tune them using a novel synthetic data generation methodology. The key idea is to develop a comprehensive dataset using symbolic methods that capture different skill levels, ranging from recognition of visual elements to multi-choice quizzes to synthesis-style tasks. We showcase how various aspects of symbolic information in synthetic data help improve fine-tuned models' performance. We will release the full implementation and datasets to facilitate further research on enhancing computational thinking in generative models.</p></details> |  |

Automatic code generation using large language models is becoming increasingly widespread, but it rarely considers producing strong correctness guarantees. In this study, we explore the ability of LLMs to produce verified code in three verification languages (Dafny, Nagini, and Verus). To do so, we use manually curated datasets derived from the state-ofthe-art Python benchmark, HumanEval. We also assess what types of information are sufficient to achieve good-quality results.</p></details> |  |

We propose domain-independent dynamic programming (DIDP), a novel model-based paradigm based on dynamic programming (DP). While DP is not new, it has typically been implemented as a problem-specific method. We introduce Dynamic Programming Description Language (DyPDL), a formalism to define DP models based on a state transition system, inspired by artificial intelligence (AI) planning. we show that heuristic search algorithms can be used to solve DyPDL models and propose seven DIDP solvers. We experimentally compare our DIDP solvers with commercial MIP and CP solvers (solving MIP and CP models, respectively) on common benchmark instances of eleven combinatorial optimization problem classes. We show that DIDP outperforms MIP in nine problem classes, CP also in nine problem classes, and both MIP and CP in seven. DIDP also achieves superior performance to existing state-based solvers including domain-independent AI planners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

Existing approaches, including search-based software testing (SBST) and recent LLM-based methods, often suffer from type errors, leading to invalid inputs and assertion failures, ultimately reducing testing effectiveness. To address this, we propose TypeTest, a novel framework that enhances type correctness in test generation through a vector-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. TypeTest employs call instance retrieval and feature-based retrieval to infer parameter types accurately and construct valid test inputs. Furthermore, it utilizes the call graph to extract richer contextual information, enabling more accurate assertion generation. In addition, TypeTest incorporates a repair mechanism and iterative test generation, progressively refining test cases to improve coverage. In an evaluation on 125 real-world Python modules, TypeTest achieved an average statement coverage of 86.6% and branch coverage of 76.8%, outperforming state-of-theart tools by 5.4% and 9.3%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Two areas of particular interest are (i) universal probabilistic programming where Bayesian probabilistic models are encoded as programs, and (ii) differentiable programming where differentiation operators are first class or differential equations are part of the language semantics. These kinds of languages and their language constructs are usually studied separately or composed in restrictive ways. In this paper, we study and formalize the combination of probabilistic programming constructs, first-class differentiation, and ordinary differential equations in a higher-order setting. We propose formal semantics for a core of such differentiable probabilistic programming language (DPPL), where the type system tracks random computations and rejects unsafe compositions during type checking. The semantics and its type system are formalized, mechanized, and proven sound in Agda with respect to abstract language constructs.</p></details> |  |

Regulators favour conservative approaches for robust type I error control, though excessive conservatism may significantly reduce statistical power. We offer fundamental theoretical contributions that extend an approach proposed in 1969, resulting in the derivation of a family of exact tests designed to maximize a specific type of power. We establish theoretical guarantees for controlling type I error despite the discretization of the null parameter space. This theoretical advancement is supported by a comprehensive series of experiments to empirically quantify the power advantages compared to traditional hypothesis tests. The approach determines the rejection region through a binary decision for each outcome dataset and uses integer programming to find an optimal decision boundary that maximizes power subject to type I error constraints. Our analysis provides new theoretical properties and insights into this approach's comparative advantages. When optimized for average power over all possible parameter configurations under the alternative, the method exhibits remarkable robustness, performing optimally or near-optimally across specific alternatives while maintaining exact type I error control. The method can be further customized for particular prior beliefs by using a weighted average. The findings highlight both the method's practical utility and how techniques from combinatorial optimization can enhance statistical methodology.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 2 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Programming Language Confusion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13620v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models for code (Code LLMs) have gained significant traction in software engineering, achieving state-of-the-art performance on various programming tasks including code completion, generation, repair, and translation. These models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in understanding programming concepts, implementing algorithms, and even bridging different programming languages, fundamentally transforming how developers interact with coding environments. Despite these advances, Code LLMs often struggle with programming language confusion--producing code in unintended languages despite explicit instructions or obvious context. We systematically evaluate this phenomenon across diverse programming contexts. Our study assesses seven popular general and Code LLMs across multiple natural and programming languages, analyzing their behavior using four datasets (HumanEval, HumanEval-xl, MBPP, TP3) for code generation and one dataset (CodeNet) for code translation. The study results reveal that language confusion occurs across all evaluated models, with StarCoder and CodeLlama exhibiting the highest confusion rates. Even high-performing models fail to maintain language consistency throughout generated solutions, particularly when handling complex algorithmic problems. We identify key factors contributing to this confusion, including syntactic similarities between programming languages and inconsistent prompt formatting. Interestingly, we find evidence suggesting that LLMs consistently exhibit strategic language migration behaviors, prioritizing languages where they can produce more syntactically correct code even when explicitly instructed otherwise. This phenomenon is particularly pronounced in code generation tasks, where models show strong migration patterns toward Python and between syntactically similar language pairs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Program Synthesis Dialog Agents for Interactive Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19610v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world eligibility problems, ranging from medical diagnosis to tax planning, can be mapped to decision problems expressed in natural language, wherein a model must make a binary choice based on user features. Large-scale domains such as legal codes or frequently updated funding opportunities render human annotation (e.g., web forms or decision trees) impractical, highlighting the need for agents that can automatically assist in decision-making. Since relevant information is often only known to the user, it is crucial that these agents ask the right questions. As agents determine when to terminate a conversation, they face a trade-off between accuracy and the number of questions asked, a key metric for both user experience and cost. To evaluate this task, we propose BeNYfits, a new benchmark for determining user eligibility for multiple overlapping social benefits opportunities through interactive decision-making. Our experiments show that current language models struggle with frequent hallucinations, with GPT-4o scoring only 35.7 F1 using a ReAct-style chain-of-thought. To address this, we introduce ProADA, a novel approach that leverages program synthesis to assist in decision-making by mapping dialog planning to a code generation problem and using gaps in structured data to determine the best next action. Our agent, ProADA, improves the F1 score to 55.6 while maintaining nearly the same number of dialog turns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Program Behavioral Models from Synthesized Input-Output Pairs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.08597v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Modelizer - a novel framework that, given a black-box program, learns a model from its input/output behavior using neural machine translation algorithms. The resulting model mocks the original program: Given an input, the model predicts the output that would have been produced by the program. However, the model is also reversible - that is, the model can predict the input that would have produced a given output. Finally, the model is differentiable and can be efficiently restricted to predict only a certain aspect of the program behavior. Modelizer uses grammars to synthesize and inputs and unsupervised tokenizers to decompose the resulting outputs, allowing it to learn sequence-to-sequence associations between token streams. Other than input grammars, Modelizer only requires the ability to execute the program. The resulting models are small, requiring fewer than 6.3 million parameters for languages such as Markdown or HTML; and they are accurate, achieving up to 95.4% accuracy and a BLEU score of 0.98 with standard error 0.04 in mocking real-world applications. As it learns from and predicts executions rather than code, Modelizer departs from the LLM-centric research trend, opening new opportunities for program-specific models that are fully tuned towards individual programs. Indeed, we foresee several applications of these models, especially as the output of the program can be any aspect of program behavior. Beyond mocking and predicting program behavior, the models can also synthesize inputs that are likely to produce a particular behavior, such as failures or coverage, thus assisting in program understanding and maintenance.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 9 figures, 12 tables</p></details> |
| **[An Online Integrated Development Environment for Automated Programming Assessment Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13127v1)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing demand for programmers has led to a surge in participants in programming courses, making it increasingly challenging for instructors to assess student code manually. As a result, automated programming assessment systems (APASs) have been developed to streamline this process. These APASs support lecturers by managing and evaluating student programming exercises at scale. However, these tools often do not provide feature-rich online editors compared to their traditional integrated development environments (IDEs) counterparts. This absence of key features, such as syntax highlighting and autocompletion, can negatively impact the learning experience, as these tools are crucial for effective coding practice. To address this gap, this research contributes to the field of programming education by extracting and defining requirements for an online IDE in an educational context and presenting a prototypical implementation of an open-source solution for a scalable and secure online IDE. The usability of the new online IDE was assessed using the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), gathering feedback from 27 first-year students through a structured survey. In addition to these qualitative insights, quantitative measures such as memory (RAM) usage were evaluated to determine the efficiency and scalability of the tool under varying usage conditions.</p></details> | 12 pages, CSEDU 2025 |

However, current quantum programming languages often require low-level implementation, posing significant barriers for many developers due to their steep learning curve and limited abstraction. In response, we introduce \textbf{Qutes}, a high-level quantum programming language designed to simplify quantum algorithm development while maintaining the flexibility required for advanced applications. By abstracting complex quantum operations and allowing intuitive expressions through high-level constructs, Qutes enables users to write efficient quantum programs without extensive knowledge of quantum mechanics or circuit design. Built upon Qiskit, Qutes translates its syntax directly into executable quantum code, facilitating seamless integration with quantum hardware. This paper provides an overview of the language's architecture, core functionalities, and its ability to unify classical and quantum operations within a single framework. Additionally, we demonstrate Qutes' application in key quantum algorithms, showcasing its potential to make quantum programming more accessible and practical for a wider range of developers and researchers.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Promising Future: Omission Failures in Choreographic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/1712.05465v4)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Choreographic programming promises a simple approach to the coding of concurrent and distributed systems: write the collective communication behaviour of a system of processes as a choreography, and then the programs for these processes are automatically compiled by a provably-correct procedure known as endpoint projection. While this promise prompted substantial research, a theory that can deal with realistic communication failures in a distributed network remains elusive. In this work, we provide the first theory of choreographic programming that addresses realistic communication failures taken from the literature of distributed systems: processes can send or receive fewer messages than they should (send and receive omission), and the network can fail at transporting messages (omission failure). Our theory supports the programming of strategies for failure recovery, and a novel static analysis (called robustness) to check for delivery guarantees (at-most-once and exactly-once). Our key technical innovation is a deconstruction of the usual communication primitive in choreographies to allow for independent implementations of the send and receive actions of a communication, while still retaining the static guarantee that these actions will correlate correctly (the essence of choreographic programming). This has two main benefits. First, each side of a communication can adopt its own failure recovery strategy, as in realistic protocols. Second, initiating new communications does not require any (unrealistic) synchronisation over unreliable channels: senders and receivers agree by construction on how each message should be identified. We validate our design via a series of examples -- including two-phase commit, which so far eluded choreographic programming -- and an implementation of our ideas in the choreographic programming language Choral.</p></details> | IMADA-preprint |
| **[Semidefinite programming relaxations and debiasing for MAXCUT-based clustering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10927v2)** | 2025-03-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider the problem of partitioning a small data sample of size $n$ drawn from a mixture of 2 sub-gaussian distributions in $\R^p$. We consider semidefinite programming relaxations of an integer quadratic program that is formulated as finding the maximum cut on a graph, where edge weights in the cut represent dissimilarity scores between two nodes based on their $p$ features. We are interested in the case that individual features are of low average quality $\gamma$, and we want to use as few of them as possible to correctly partition the sample. Denote by $\Delta^2:=p \gamma$ the $\ell_2^2$ distance between two centers (mean vectors) in $\R^p$. The goal is to allow a full range of tradeoffs between $n, p, \gamma$ in the sense that partial recovery (success rate $< 100%$) is feasible once the signal to noise ratio $s^2 := \min{np \gamma^2, \Delta^2}$ is lower bounded by a constant. For both balanced and unbalanced cases, we allow each population to have distinct covariance structures with diagonal matrices as special cases. In the present work, (a) we provide a unified framework for analyzing three computationally efficient algorithms, namely, SDP1, BalancedSDP, and Spectral clustering; and (b) we prove that the misclassification error decays exponentially with respect to the SNR $s^2$ for SDP1. Moreover, for balanced partitions, we design an estimator $\bf {BalancedSDP}$ with a superb debiasing property. Indeed, with this new estimator, we remove an assumption (A2) on bounding the trace difference between the two population covariance matrices while proving the exponential error bound as stated above. These estimators and their statistical analyses are novel to the best of our knowledge. We provide simulation evidence illuminating the theoretical predictions.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2301.00344</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Formally Reason as Abstract Interpreters for Program Analysis?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12686v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have demonstrated impressive capabilities in code generation and comprehension, but their potential in being able to perform program analysis in a formal, automatic manner remains under-explored. To that end, we systematically investigate whether LLMs can reason about programs using a program analysis framework called abstract interpretation. We prompt LLMs to follow two different strategies, denoted as Compositional and Fixed Point Equation, to formally reason in the style of abstract interpretation, which has never been done before to the best of our knowledge. We validate our approach using state-of-the-art LLMs on 22 challenging benchmark programs from the Software Verification Competition (SV-COMP) 2019 dataset, widely used in program analysis. Our results show that our strategies are able to elicit abstract interpretation-based reasoning in the tested models, but LLMs are susceptible to logical errors, especially while interpreting complex program structures, as well as general hallucinations. This highlights key areas for improvement in the formal reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Modular Quantum Network Architecture for Integrating Network Scheduling with Local Program Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12582v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an architecture for scheduling network operations enabling the end-to-end generation of entanglement according to user demand. The main challenge solved by this architecture is to allow for the integration of a network schedule with the execution of quantum programs running on processing end nodes in order to realise quantum network applications. A key element of this architecture is the definition of an entanglement packet to meet application requirements on near-term quantum networks where the lifetimes of the qubits stored at the end nodes are limited. Our architecture is fully modular and hardware agnostic, and defines a framework for further research on specific components that can now be developed independently of each other. In order to evaluate our architecture, we realise a proof of concept implementation on a simulated 6-node network in a star topology. We show our architecture facilitates the execution of quantum network applications, and that robust admission control is required to maintain quality of service. Finally, we comment on potential bottlenecks in our architecture and provide suggestions for future improvements.</p></details> | 38 pages, 9 figures |
| **[A Showdown of ChatGPT vs DeepSeek in Solving Programming Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13549v1)** | 2025-03-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has created a competitive landscape for AI-assisted programming tools. This study evaluates two leading models: ChatGPT 03-mini and DeepSeek-R1 on their ability to solve competitive programming tasks from Codeforces. Using 29 programming tasks of three levels of easy, medium, and hard difficulty, we assessed the outcome of both models by their accepted solutions, memory efficiency, and runtime performance. Our results indicate that while both models perform similarly on easy tasks, ChatGPT outperforms DeepSeek-R1 on medium-difficulty tasks, achieving a 54.5% success rate compared to DeepSeek 18.1%. Both models struggled with hard tasks, thus highlighting some ongoing challenges LLMs face in handling highly complex programming problems. These findings highlight key differences in both model capabilities and their computational power, offering valuable insights for developers and researchers working to advance AI-driven programming tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Wolbachia-Based Control Programs in Urban Settings: Insights from Spatial Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12262v1)** | 2025-03-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Arboviral diseases remain a major public health concern, particularly in tropical and subtropical regions where mosquito populations thrive. One promising strategy to curb transmission is the release of Aedes aegypti mosquitoes infected with Wolbachia, a bacterium that reduces their ability to spread viruses. However, past large-scale releases have not always been successful, especially in complex urban settings, where restricted access to certain areas often leads to infection establishment failures and wasted resources. To address this, we developed and analyzed a partial differential equation model that simulates how Wolbachia-infected mosquitoes are established in different urban environments. We also explored strategies to improve their success under constraints on release size and the efficacy level of insecticide used for pre-release interventions. Our findings suggest that targeted releases are most effective in areas with limited mosquito movement without additional insecticide use. In higher mosquito dispersal areas, reducing at least 35% of wild mosquitoes before release significantly improves establishment within nine months. Additionally, distributing releases over 2-5 weekly batches enhances success more than a single large release, even without other interventions. These findings offer practical insights for designing cost-effective and efficient Wolbachia-based mosquito control programs, reducing the burden of mosquito-borne diseases on vulnerable communities.</p></details> | 26 pages, 9 figures |
