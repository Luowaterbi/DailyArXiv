| **[An Analytical Study of the Min-Sum Approximation for Polar Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13092v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The min-sum approximation is widely used in the decoding of polar codes. Although it is a numerical approximation, hardly any penalties are incurred in practice. We give a theoretical justification for this. We consider the common case of a binary-input, memoryless, and symmetric channel, decoded using successive cancellation and the min-sum approximation. Under mild assumptions, we show the following. For the finite length case, we show how to exactly calculate the error probabilities of all synthetic (bit) channels in time $O(N^{1.585})$, where $N$ is the codeword length. This implies a code construction algorithm with the above complexity. For the asymptotic case, we develop two rate thresholds, denoted $R_{\mathrm{L}} = R_{\mathrm{L}}(\lambda)$ and $R_{\mathrm{U}} =R_{\mathrm{U}}(\lambda)$, where $\lambda(\cdot)$ is the labeler of the channel outputs (essentially, a quantizer). For any $0 < \beta < \frac{1}{2}$ and any code rate $R < R_{\mathrm{L}}$, there exists a family of polar codes with growing lengths such that their rates are at least $R$ and their error probabilities are at most $2^{-N^\beta}$. That is, strong polarization continues to hold under the min-sum approximation. Conversely, for code rates exceeding $R_{\mathrm{U}}$, the error probability approaches $1$ as the code-length increases, irrespective of which bits are frozen. We show that $0 < R_{\mathrm{L}} \leq R_{\mathrm{U}} \leq C$, where $C$ is the channel capacity. The last inequality is often strict, in which case the ramification of using the min-sum approximation is that we can no longer achieve capacity.</p></details> |  |
| **[SURGE: On the Potential of Large Language Models as General-Purpose Surrogate Code Executors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11167v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural surrogate models have emerged as powerful and efficient tools in data mining. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code-related tasks. We investigate a novel application: using LLMs as surrogate models for code execution prediction. Given LLMs' unique ability to understand and process diverse programs, they present a promising direction for building general-purpose surrogate models. To systematically investigate this capability, we introduce SURGE, a comprehensive benchmark with $1160$ problems covering $8$ key aspects: multi-language programming tasks, competition-level programming problems, repository-level code analysis, high-cost scientific computing, time-complexity-intensive algorithms, buggy code analysis, programs dependent on specific compilers or execution environments, and formal mathematical proof verification. Through extensive empirical analysis of $21$ open-source and proprietary LLMs, we examine scaling laws, data efficiency, and predictive accuracy. Our findings reveal important insights about the feasibility of LLMs as efficient surrogates for computational processes, with implications for automated software testing, program analysis, and computational resource optimization in data mining applications. Code and dataset are released at https://github.com/Imbernoulli/SURGE.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Rise and Down of Babel Tower: Investigating the Evolution Process of Multilingual Code Large Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.07298v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown significant multilingual capabilities. However, the mechanisms underlying the development of these capabilities during pre-training are not well understood. In this paper, we use code LLMs as an experimental platform to explore the evolution of multilingual capabilities in LLMs during the pre-training process. Based on our observations, we propose the Babel Tower Hypothesis, which describes the entire process of LLMs acquiring new language capabilities. During the learning process, multiple languages initially share a single knowledge system dominated by the primary language and gradually develop language-specific knowledge systems. We then validate the above hypothesis by tracking the internal states of the LLMs through identifying working languages and language transferring neurons. Experimental results show that the internal state changes of the LLM are consistent with our Babel Tower Hypothesis. Building on these insights, we propose a novel method to construct an optimized pre-training corpus for multilingual code LLMs, which significantly outperforms LLMs trained on the original corpus. The proposed Babel Tower Hypothesis provides new insights into designing pre-training data distributions to achieve optimal multilingual capabilities in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Learned codes for broadcast channels with feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04083v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We focus on designing error-correcting codes for the symmetric Gaussian broadcast channel with feedback. Feedback not only expands the capacity region of the broadcast channel but also enhances transmission reliability. In this work, we study the construction of learned finite blocklength codes for broadcast channels with feedback. Learned error-correcting codes, in which both the encoder and decoder are jointly trained, have shown impressive performance in point-to-point channels, particularly with noisy feedback. However, few learned schemes exist for multi-user channels. Here, we develop a lightweight code for the broadcast channel with feedback that performs well and operates effectively at short blocklengths.</p></details> | accept to ICC 2025 |
| **[A Deterministic Construction of a Large Distance Code from the Wozencraft Ensemble](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.02484v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present an explicit construction of a sequence of rate $1/2$ Wozencraft ensemble codes (over any fixed finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$) that achieve minimum distance $\Omega(\sqrt{k})$ where $k$ is the message length. The coefficients of the Wozencraft ensemble codes are constructed using Sidon Sets and the cyclic structure of $\mathbb{F}_{q^{k}}$ where $k+1$ is prime with $q$ a primitive root modulo $k+1$. Assuming Artin's conjecture, there are infinitely many such $k$ for any prime power $q$.</p></details> |  |
| **[We Have a Package for You! A Comprehensive Analysis of Package Hallucinations by Code Generating LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10279v3)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reliance of popular programming languages such as Python and JavaScript on centralized package repositories and open-source software, combined with the emergence of code-generating Large Language Models (LLMs), has created a new type of threat to the software supply chain: package hallucinations. These hallucinations, which arise from fact-conflicting errors when generating code using LLMs, represent a novel form of package confusion attack that poses a critical threat to the integrity of the software supply chain. This paper conducts a rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of package hallucinations across different programming languages, settings, and parameters, exploring how a diverse set of models and configurations affect the likelihood of generating erroneous package recommendations and identifying the root causes of this phenomenon. Using 16 popular LLMs for code generation and two unique prompt datasets, we generate 576,000 code samples in two programming languages that we analyze for package hallucinations. Our findings reveal that that the average percentage of hallucinated packages is at least 5.2% for commercial models and 21.7% for open-source models, including a staggering 205,474 unique examples of hallucinated package names, further underscoring the severity and pervasiveness of this threat. To overcome this problem, we implement several hallucination mitigation strategies and show that they are able to significantly reduce the number of package hallucinations while maintaining code quality. Our experiments and findings highlight package hallucinations as a persistent and systemic phenomenon while using state-of-the-art LLMs for code generation, and a significant challenge which deserves the research community's urgent attention.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the 2025 USENIX Security Symposium. 22 pages, 14 figures, 8 tables.

Still, developers often struggle to incorporate these properties into software projects as they either lack proper cybersecurity training or do not consider them a priority. Prior work has tried to support privacy and security engineering activities through threat modeling methods for scrutinizing flaws in system architectures. Moreover, several techniques for the automatic identification of vulnerabilities and the generation of secure code implementations have also been proposed in the current literature. Conversely, such as-code approaches seem under-investigated in the privacy domain, with little work elaborating on (i) the automatic detection of privacy properties in source code or (ii) the generation of privacy-friendly code. In this work, we seek to characterize the current research landscape of Privacy as Code (PaC) methods and tools by conducting a rapid literature review. Our results suggest that PaC research is in its infancy, especially regarding the performance evaluation and usability assessment of the existing approaches. Based on these findings, we outline and discuss prospective research directions concerning empirical studies with software practitioners, the curation of benchmark datasets, and the role of generative AI technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 18th International Conference on Cooperative and Human Aspects of Software Engineering (CHASE '25)</p></details> |
| **[Steering Large Language Models between Code Execution and Textual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03524v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While a lot of recent research focuses on enhancing the textual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by optimizing the multi-agent framework or reasoning chains, several benchmark tasks can be solved with 100\% success through direct coding, which is more scalable and avoids the computational overhead associated with textual iterating and searching. Textual reasoning has inherent limitations in solving tasks with challenges in math, logics, optimization, and searching, which is unlikely to be solved by simply scaling up the model and data size. The recently released OpenAI GPT Code Interpreter and multi-agent frameworks such as AutoGen have demonstrated remarkable proficiency of integrating code generation and execution to solve complex tasks using LLMs. However, based on our experiments on 7 existing popular methods for steering code/text generation in both single- and multi-turn settings with 14 tasks and 6 types of LLMs (including the new O1-preview), currently there is no optimal method to correctly steer LLMs to write code when needed. We discover some interesting patterns on when models use code vs. textual reasoning with the evolution to task complexity and model sizes, which even result in an astonishingly inverse scaling behavior. We also discover that results from LLM written code are not always better than using textual reasoning, even if the task could be solved through code. To mitigate the above issues, we propose three methods to better steer LLM code/text generation and achieve a notable improvement. The costs of token lengths and runtime are thoroughly discussed for all the methods. We believe the problem of steering LLM code/text generation is critical for future research and has much space for further improvement.

| **[Spike Talk: Genesis and Neural Coding Scheme Translations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.00773v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although digitalization of future power grids offer several coordination incentives, the reliability and security of information and communication technologies (ICT) hinders its overall performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture Spike Talk via a unified representation of power and information as a means of data normalization using spikes for coordinated control of microgrids. This grid-edge technology allows each distributed energy resource (DER) to execute decentralized secondary control philosophy independently by interacting among each other using power flow along the tie-lines. Inspired from the field of computational neuroscience, Spike Talk basically builds on a fine-grained parallelism on the information transfer theory in our brains, particularly when neurons (modeled as DERs) transmit information (inferred from power streams measurable at each DER) through synapses (modeled as tie-lines). Not only does Spike Talk simplify and address the current bottlenecks of the cyber-physical architectural operation by dismissing the ICT layer, it provides intrinsic operational and cost-effective opportunities in terms of infrastructure development, computations and modeling. Hence, this paper provides a pedagogic illustration of the key concepts and design theories. Since we focus on coordinated control of microgrids in this paper, the signaling accuracy and system performance is studied for several neural coding schemes responsible for converting the real-valued local measurements into spikes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid</p></details> |
| **[CAT and DOG: Improved Codes for Private Distributed Matrix Multiplication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12371v3)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present novel constructions of polynomial codes for private distributed matrix multiplication (PDMM/SDMM) using outer product partitioning (OPP). We extend the degree table framework from the literature to cyclic-addition degree tables (CATs). By using roots of unity as evaluation points, we enable modulo-addition in the table. Based on CATs, we present an explicit construction, called CATx, that requires fewer workers than existing schemes in the low-privacy regime. Additionally, we present new families of schemes based on conventional degree tables, called GASPrs and DOGrs, that outperform the state-of-the-art for a wide range of parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unified Framework for Automated Code Transformation and Pragma Insertion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03058v6)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-level synthesis, source-to-source compilers, and various Design Space Exploration techniques for pragma insertion have significantly improved the Quality of Results of generated designs. These tools offer benefits such as reduced development time and enhanced performance. However, achieving high-quality results often requires additional manual code transformations and tiling selections, which are typically performed separately or as pre-processing steps. Although DSE techniques enable code transformation upfront, the vastness of the search space often limits the exploration of all possible code transformations, making it challenging to determine which transformations are necessary. Additionally, ensuring correctness remains challenging, especially for complex transformations and optimizations. To tackle this obstacle, we first propose a comprehensive framework leveraging HLS compilers. Our system streamlines code transformation, pragma insertion, and tiles size selection for on-chip data caching through a unified optimization problem, aiming to enhance parallelization, particularly beneficial for computation-bound kernels. Them employing a novel Non-Linear Programming (NLP) approach, we simultaneously ascertain transformations, pragmas, and tile sizes, focusing on regular loop-based kernels. Our evaluation demonstrates that our framework adeptly identifies the appropriate transformations, including scenarios where no transformation is necessary, and inserts pragmas to achieve a favorable Quality of Results.</p></details> |  |
| **[RuCCoD: Towards Automated ICD Coding in Russian](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21263v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the feasibility of automating clinical coding in Russian, a language with limited biomedical resources. We present a new dataset for ICD coding, which includes diagnosis fields from electronic health records (EHRs) annotated with over 10,000 entities and more than 1,500 unique ICD codes. This dataset serves as a benchmark for several state-of-the-art models, including BERT, LLaMA with LoRA, and RAG, with additional experiments examining transfer learning across domains (from PubMed abstracts to medical diagnosis) and terminologies (from UMLS concepts to ICD codes). We then apply the best-performing model to label an in-house EHR dataset containing patient histories from 2017 to 2021. Our experiments, conducted on a carefully curated test set, demonstrate that training with the automated predicted codes leads to a significant improvement in accuracy compared to manually annotated data from physicians. We believe our findings offer valuable insights into the potential for automating clinical coding in resource-limited languages like Russian, which could enhance clinical efficiency and data accuracy in these contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Transformer-based Decoder for Varshamov-Tenengolts Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21060v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the rise of DNA data storage technology has brought significant attention to the challenge of correcting insertion, deletion, and substitution (IDS) errors. Among various coding methods for IDS correction, Varshamov-Tenengolts (VT) codes, primarily designed for single-error correction, have emerged as a central research focus. While existing decoding methods achieve high accuracy in correcting a single error, they often fail to correct multiple IDS errors. In this work, we observe that VT codes retain some capability for addressing multiple errors by introducing a transformer-based VT decoder (TVTD) along with symbol- and statistic-based codeword embedding. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TVTD achieves perfect correction of a single error. Furthermore, when decoding multiple errors across various codeword lengths, the bit error rate and frame error rate are significantly improved compared to existing hard decision and soft-in soft-out algorithms. Additionally, through model architecture optimization, the proposed method reduces time consumption by an order of magnitude compared to other soft decoders.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Vibrotactile communication could be useful in providing information without compropmising or loading a person's visual or auditory perception. This paper considers applications in Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) scenarios where a human working alongside a robot is likely to be operating in high cognitive load conditions. The focus is on understanding how best to convey information considering different vibrotactile information coding strategies to enhance scene understanding in scenarios where a robot might be operating remotely as a scout. In exploring information representation, this paper introduces Semantic Haptics, using shapes and patterns to represent certain events as if the skin was a screen, and shows how these lead to bettter learnability and interpreation accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pragmatic Reasoning improves LLM Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15835v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive potential in translating natural language (NL) instructions into program code. However, user instructions often contain inherent ambiguities, making it challenging for LLMs to generate code that accurately reflects the user's true intent. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed to produce multiple candidates of the program code and then rerank them to identify the best solution. In this paper, we propose CodeRSA, a novel code candidate reranking mechanism built upon the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, designed to guide LLMs toward more comprehensive pragmatic reasoning about user intent. We evaluate CodeRSA using one of the latest LLMs on a popular code generation dataset. Our experiment results show that CodeRSA consistently outperforms common baselines, surpasses the state-of-the-art approach in most cases, and demonstrates robust overall performance. These findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating pragmatic reasoning into code candidate reranking, offering a promising direction for enhancing code generation quality in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

ChartMimic utilizes information-intensive visual charts and textual instructions as inputs, requiring LMMs to generate the corresponding code for chart rendering. ChartMimic includes 4,800 human-curated (figure, instruction, code) triplets, which represent the authentic chart use cases found in scientific papers across various domains (e.g., Physics, Computer Science, Economics, etc). These charts span 18 regular types and 4 advanced types, diversifying into 201 subcategories. Furthermore, we propose multi-level evaluation metrics to provide an automatic and thorough assessment of the output code and the rendered charts. Unlike existing code generation benchmarks, ChartMimic places emphasis on evaluating LMMs' capacity to harmonize a blend of cognitive capabilities, encompassing visual understanding, code generation, and cross-modal reasoning. The evaluation of $3$ proprietary models and 14 open-weight models highlights the substantial challenges posed by ChartMimic. Even the advanced GPT-4o, InternVL2-Llama3-76B only achieved an average score across Direct Mimic and Customized Mimic tasks of 82.2 and 61.6, respectively, indicating significant room for improvement. We anticipate that ChartMimic will inspire the development of LMMs, advancing the pursuit of artificial general intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

Projective Reed-Muller codes are evaluation codes obtained by evaluating homogeneous polynomials at the projective space. We obtain asymmetric and symmetric quantum codes by using the CSS construction and the Hermitian construction, respectively. We provide entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes from projective Reed-Muller codes with flexible amounts of entanglement by considering equivalent codes. Moreover, we also construct quantum codes from subfield subcodes of projective Reed-Muller codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Natural Language Perplexity: Detecting Dead Code Poisoning in Code Generation Datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20246v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) for code-related tasks has raised concerns about the security of their training datasets. One critical threat is dead code poisoning, where syntactically valid but functionally redundant code is injected into training data to manipulate model behavior. Such attacks can degrade the performance of neural code search systems, leading to biased or insecure code suggestions. Existing detection methods, such as token-level perplexity analysis, fail to effectively identify dead code due to the structural and contextual characteristics of programming languages. In this paper, we propose DePA (Dead Code Perplexity Analysis), a novel line-level detection and cleansing method tailored to the structural properties of code. DePA computes line-level perplexity by leveraging the contextual relationships between code lines and identifies anomalous lines by comparing their perplexity to the overall distribution within the file. Our experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that DePA significantly outperforms existing methods, achieving 0.14-0.19 improvement in detection F1-score and a 44-65% increase in poisoned segment localization precision. Furthermore, DePA enhances detection speed by 0.62-23x, making it practical for large-scale dataset cleansing. Overall, by addressing the unique challenges of dead code poisoning, DePA provides a robust and efficient solution for safeguarding the integrity of code generation model training datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detection of LLM-Paraphrased Code and Identification of the Responsible LLM Using Coding Style Features](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17749v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) for code generation has raised serious concerns about intellectual property protection. Malicious users can exploit LLMs to produce paraphrased versions of proprietary code that closely resemble the original. While the potential for LLM-assisted code paraphrasing continues to grow, research on detecting it remains limited, underscoring an urgent need for detection system. We respond to this need by proposing two tasks. The first task is to detect whether code generated by an LLM is a paraphrased version of original human-written code. The second task is to identify which LLM is used to paraphrase the original code. For these tasks, we construct a dataset LPcode consisting of pairs of human-written code and LLM-paraphrased code using various LLMs. We statistically confirm significant differences in the coding styles of human-written and LLM-paraphrased code, particularly in terms of naming consistency, code structure, and readability. Based on these findings, we develop LPcodedec, a detection method that identifies paraphrase relationships between human-written and LLM-generated code, and discover which LLM is used for the paraphrasing. LPcodedec outperforms the best baselines in two tasks, improving F1 scores by 2.64% and 15.17% while achieving speedups of 1,343x and 213x, respectively. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/Shinwoo-Park/detecting_llm_paraphrased_code_via_coding_style_features.</p></details> |  |
| **[Overlapped Arithmetic Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20781v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Arithmetic codes are usually deemed as the most important means to implement lossless source coding, whose principle is mapping every source symbol to a sub-interval in [0, 1). For every source symbol, the length of its mapping sub-interval is exactly equal to its probability. With this symbol-interval mapping rule, the interval [0,1) will be fully covered and there is neither overlapped sub-interval (corresponds to more than one source symbol) nor forbidden sub-interval (does not correspond to any source symbol). It is well-known that there is a duality between source coding and channel coding, so every good source code may also be a good channel code meanwhile, and vice versa. Inspired by this duality, arithmetic codes can be easily generalized to address many coding problems beyond source coding by redefining the source-interval mapping rule. If every source symbol is mapped to an enlarged sub-interval, the mapping sub-intervals of different source symbols will be partially overlapped and we obtain overlapped arithmetic codes, which can realize distributed source coding. On the contrary, if every source symbol is mapped to a narrowed sub-interval, there will be one or more forbidden sub-intervals in [0, 1) that do not correspond to any source symbol and we obtain forbidden arithmetic codes, which can implement joint source-channel coding. Furthermore, by allowing the coexistence of overlapped sub-intervals and forbidden sub-intervals, we will obtain hybrid arithmetic codes, which can cope with distributed joint source-channel coding.</p></details> | <details><summary>An ac...</summary><p>An accompanying software package is available on https://github.com/fy79/NOW-FTCIT.

| **[Measuring Determinism in Large Language Models for Software Code Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20747v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) promise to streamline software code reviews, but their ability to produce consistent assessments remains an open question. In this study, we tested four leading LLMs -- GPT-4o mini, GPT-4o, Claude 3.5 Sonnet, and LLaMA 3.2 90B Vision -- on 70 Java commits from both private and public repositories. By setting each model's temperature to zero, clearing context, and repeating the exact same prompts five times, we measured how consistently each model generated code-review assessments. Our results reveal that even with temperature minimized, LLM responses varied to different degrees. These findings highlight a consideration about the inherently limited consistency (test-retest reliability) of LLMs -- even when the temperature is set to zero -- and the need for caution when using LLM-generated code reviews to make real-world decisions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generating CAD Code with Vision-Language Models for 3D Designs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05340v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI has transformed the fields of Design and Manufacturing by providing efficient and automated methods for generating and modifying 3D objects. One approach involves using Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate Computer- Aided Design (CAD) scripting code, which can then be executed to render a 3D object; however, the resulting 3D object may not meet the specified requirements. Testing the correctness of CAD generated code is challenging due to the complexity and structure of 3D objects (e.g., shapes, surfaces, and dimensions) that are not feasible in code. In this paper, we introduce CADCodeVerify, a novel approach to iteratively verify and improve 3D objects generated from CAD code. Our approach works by producing ameliorative feedback by prompting a Vision-Language Model (VLM) to generate and answer a set of validation questions to verify the generated object and prompt the VLM to correct deviations. To evaluate CADCodeVerify, we introduce, CADPrompt, the first benchmark for CAD code generation, consisting of 200 natural language prompts paired with expert-annotated scripting code for 3D objects to benchmark progress. Our findings show that CADCodeVerify improves VLM performance by providing visual feedback, enhancing the structure of the 3D objects, and increasing the success rate of the compiled program. When applied to GPT-4, CADCodeVerify achieved a 7.30% reduction in Point Cloud distance and a 5.0% improvement in success rate compared to prior work</p></details> |  |
| **[Near-Optimal List-Recovery of Linear Code Families](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13877v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We prove several results on linear codes achieving list-recovery capacity. We show that random linear codes achieve list-recovery capacity with constant output list size (independent of the alphabet size and length). That is, over alphabets of size at least $\ell^{\Omega(1/\varepsilon)}$, random linear codes of rate $R$ are $(1-R-\varepsilon, \ell, (\ell/\varepsilon)^{O(\ell/\varepsilon)})$-list-recoverable for all $R\in(0,1)$ and $\ell$. Together with a result of Levi, Mosheiff, and Shagrithaya, this implies that randomly punctured Reed-Solomon codes also achieve list-recovery capacity. We also prove that our output list size is near-optimal among all linear codes: all $(1-R-\varepsilon, \ell, L)$-list-recoverable linear codes must have $L\ge \ell^{\Omega(R/\varepsilon)}$. Our simple upper bound combines the Zyablov-Pinsker argument with recent bounds from Kopparty, Ron-Zewi, Saraf, Wootters, and Tamo on the maximum intersection of a "list-recovery ball" and a low-dimensional subspace with large distance. Our lower bound is inspired by a recent lower bound of Chen and Zhang.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[Multi-Turn Code Generation Through Single-Step Rewards](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20380v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We address the problem of code generation from multi-turn execution feedback. Existing methods either generate code without feedback or use complex, hierarchical reinforcement learning to optimize multi-turn rewards. We propose a simple yet scalable approach, $\mu$Code, that solves multi-turn code generation using only single-step rewards. Our key insight is that code generation is a one-step recoverable MDP, where the correct code can be recovered from any intermediate code state in a single turn. $\mu$Code iteratively trains both a generator to provide code solutions conditioned on multi-turn execution feedback and a verifier to score the newly generated code.

| **[Moderate-length lifted quantum Tanner codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20297v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce new families of quantum Tanner codes, a class of quantum codes which first appeared in the work of Leverrier and Z\'emor. These codes are built from two classical Tanner codes, for which the underlying graphs are extracted from coverings of 2D geometrical complexes, and the local linear codes are tensor-product of cyclic or double-circulant linear codes. We present several explicit families, and identify instances of moderate length quantum codes which are degenerate, have low check weight, and for which the distance surpasses the square root of the code length. Among them, we report the existence of a $[[96,2,12]]$ code, for which half of the checks are of weight 8 and the other half of weight 4.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code Style Sheets: CSS for Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09386v5)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program text is rendered using impoverished typographic styles. Beyond choice of fonts and syntax-highlighting colors, code editors and related tools utilize very few text decorations. These limited styles are, furthermore, applied in monolithic fashion, regardless of the programs and tasks at hand. We present the notion of _code style sheets_ for styling program text. Motivated by analogy to cascading style sheets (CSS) for styling HTML documents, code style sheets provide mechanisms for defining rules to select elements from an abstract syntax tree (AST) in order to style their corresponding visual representation. Technically, our selector language generalizes essential constructs from CSS to a programming-language setting with algebraic data types (such as ASTs). Practically, code style sheets allow ASTs to be styled granularly, based on semantic information -- such as the structure of abstract syntax, static type information, and corresponding run-time values -- as well as design choices on the part of authors and readers of a program. Because programs are heavily nested in structure, a key aspect of our design is a layout algorithm that renders nested, multiline text blocks more compactly than in existing box-based layout systems such as HTML. In this paper, we design and implement a code style sheets system for a subset of Haskell, using it to illustrate several code presentation and visualization tasks. These examples demonstrate that code style sheets provide a uniform framework for rendering programs in multivarious ways, which could be employed in future designs for text-based as well as structure editors.</p></details> | <details><summary>OOPSL...</summary><p>OOPSLA 2025 Paper + Appendices</p></details> |
| **[Effective Distance of Higher Dimensional HGPs and Weight-Reduced Quantum LDPC Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.02193v4)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum error correction plays a prominent role in the realization of quantum computation, and quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes are believed to be practically useful stabilizer codes. While qLDPC codes are defined to have constant weight parity-checks, the weight of these parity checks could be large constants that make implementing these codes challenging. Large constants can also result in long syndrome extraction times and bad error propagation that can impact error correction performance. Hastings recently introduced weight reduction techniques for qLDPC codes that reduce the weight of the parity checks as well as the maximum number of checks that acts on any data qubit. However, the fault tolerance of these techniques remains an open question. In this paper, we analyze the effective distance of the weight-reduced code when single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits are considered for error correction. We prove that there exists single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuits that largely preserve the effective distance of the weight-reduced qLDPC codes. In addition, we also show that the distance balancing technique introduced by Evra et al. preserves effective distance. As a corollary, our result shows that higher-dimensional hypergraph product (HGP) codes, also known as homological product codes corresponding to the product of 1-complexes, have no troublesome hook errors when using any single-ancilla syndrome extraction circuit.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated the manuscript to include distance preservation for coning for completeness</p></details> |

Also, the receiver noise can severely degrade the MCvD channel performance. However, the channel codes proposed in the literature for the MCvD system have only addressed one of these two challenges independently. In this paper, we have designed single Error Correcting Codes in an MCvD system with channel memory and noise. We have also provided encoding and decoding algorithms for the proposed codes, which are simple to follow despite having a non-linear code construction. Finally, through simulation results, we show that the proposed single ECCs, for given code parameters, perform better than the existing codes in the literature in combating the effect of ISI in the channel and improving the average Bit Error Rate (BER) performance in a noisy channel.</p></details> | 5 pages, 5 figures |

Compared to traditional systems relying on handcrafted NeRF semantic feature decomposition for compression and well-adaptive channel coding for transmission error correction, our NeRFCom employs a nonlinear transform and learned probabilistic models, enabling flexible variable-rate joint source-channel coding and efficient bandwidth allocation aligned with the NeRF semantic feature's different contribution to the 3D scene synthesis fidelity.

| **[ConvCodeWorld: Benchmarking Conversational Code Generation in Reproducible Feedback Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19852v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have proven invaluable for code generation, particularly in interactive settings. However, existing code generation benchmarks fail to capture the diverse feedback encountered in multi-turn interactions, limiting our ability to evaluate LLMs in these contexts. To address this gap, we present a set of novel benchmarks that explicitly model the quality of feedback provided to code generation LLMs. Our contributions are threefold: First, we introduce CONVCODEWORLD, a novel and reproducible environment for benchmarking interactive code generation. CONVCODEWORLD simulates 9 distinct interactive code generation scenarios while systematically combining three types of feedback: (a) compilation feedback; (b) execution feedback with varying test coverage; (c) verbal feedback generated by GPT-4o with different levels of expertise. Second, we introduce CONVCODEBENCH, a fast, static version of benchmark that uses pre-generated feedback logs, eliminating the need for costly dynamic verbal feedback generation while maintaining strong Spearman's rank correlations (0.82 to 0.99) with CONVCODEWORLD. Third, extensive evaluations of both closed-source and open-source LLMs including R1-Distill on CONVCODEWORLD reveal key insights: (a) LLM performance varies significantly based on the feedback provided; (b) Weaker LLMs, with sufficient feedback, can outperform single-turn results of state-of-the-art LLMs without feedback; (c) Training on a specific feedback combination can limit an LLM's ability to utilize unseen combinations; (d) LLMs solve problems in fewer turns (high MRR) may not solve as many problems overall (high Recall), and vice versa. All implementations and benchmarks will be made publicly available at https://huggingface.co/spaces/ConvCodeWorld/ConvCodeWorld</p></details> | ICLR 2025 |

Inspired by the strong performance of code-trained models in logic-intensive domains, we propose a novel framework that leverages event-based text to generate corresponding code and employs cyclic training to transfer the logical consistency of code to natural language effectively. Our method significantly reduces inconsistent hallucinations across three leading LLMs and two categories of natural language tasks while maintaining overall performance. This framework effectively alleviates hallucinations without necessitating adaptation to downstream tasks, demonstrating generality and providing new perspectives to tackle the challenge of inconsistent hallucinations.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeRAG-Bench: Can Retrieval Augment Code Generation?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.14497v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While language models (LMs) have proven remarkably adept at generating code, many programs are challenging for LMs to generate using their parametric knowledge alone. Providing external contexts such as library documentation can facilitate generating accurate and functional code. Despite the success of retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) in various text-oriented tasks, its potential for improving code generation remains under-explored. In this work, we conduct a systematic, large-scale analysis by asking: in what scenarios can retrieval benefit code generation models? and what challenges remain? We first curate a comprehensive evaluation benchmark, CodeRAG-Bench, encompassing three categories of code generation tasks, including basic programming, open-domain, and repository-level problems. We aggregate documents from five sources for models to retrieve contexts: competition solutions, online tutorials, library documentation, StackOverflow posts, and GitHub repositories. We examine top-performing models on CodeRAG-Bench by providing contexts retrieved from one or multiple sources. While notable gains are made in final code generation by retrieving high-quality contexts across various settings, our analysis reveals room for improvement -- current retrievers still struggle to fetch useful contexts especially with limited lexical overlap, and generators fail to improve with limited context lengths or abilities to integrate additional contexts. We hope CodeRAG-Bench serves as an effective testbed to encourage further development of advanced code-oriented RAG methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[CHAI for LLMs: Improving Code-Mixed Translation in Large Language Models through Reinforcement Learning with AI Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.09073v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities across various NLP tasks but struggle with code-mixed (or code-switched) language understanding. For example, prior work benchmarking the performance of multilingual LLMs on code-mixed translation tasks has demonstrated that current state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs are ineffective in dealing with code-mixed languages. However, the question of how to improve the capability of multilingual LLMs to handle code-mixed language has not received any attention to date. In this paper, we tackle this research gap by proposing CHAI, a novel general-purpose framework for improving the ability of multilingual LLMs to handle code-mixed languages. CHAI relies on three novel contributions made in this paper. First, we explore the ability of LLMs to provide accurate annotations for code-mixed translation tasks. Second, we leverage this ability of LLMs as annotators to generate preference data for code-mixed translation tasks at scale, which are then used within a reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) procedure to improve LLMs' capability on code-mixed tasks. Third, we conduct a rigorous experimental evaluation across various real-world datasets and settings. Our analysis shows that CHAI-powered LLMs outperform state-of-the-art open-source LLMs by 25.66% (in terms of win rate adjudicated by human annotators) in code-mixed translation tasks. This work represents a first step towards developing more inclusive code-mixed LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>full ...</summary><p>full draft: 8 pages, 2 figures</p></details> |

In this study, we examine how code serves as a structured medium for enhancing reasoning: it provides verifiable execution paths, enforces logical decomposition, and enables runtime validation. We also explore how improvements in reasoning have transformed code intelligence from basic completion to advanced capabilities, enabling models to address complex software engineering tasks through planning and debugging. Finally, we identify key challenges and propose future research directions to strengthen this synergy, ultimately improving LLM's performance in both areas.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Repo: https://github.com/dayuyang1999/Awesome-Code-Reasoning</p></details> |
| **[Learning Code-Edit Embedding to Model Student Debugging Behavior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19407v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Providing effective feedback for programming assignments in computer science education can be challenging: students solve problems by iteratively submitting code, executing it, and using limited feedback from the compiler or the auto-grader to debug. Analyzing student debugging behavior in this process may reveal important insights into their knowledge and inform better personalized support tools. In this work, we propose an encoder-decoder-based model that learns meaningful code-edit embeddings between consecutive student code submissions, to capture their debugging behavior. Our model leverages information on whether a student code submission passes each test case to fine-tune large language models (LLMs) to learn code editing representations. It enables personalized next-step code suggestions that maintain the student's coding style while improving test case correctness. Our model also enables us to analyze student code-editing patterns to uncover common student errors and debugging behaviors, using clustering techniques. Experimental results on a real-world student code submission dataset demonstrate that our model excels at code reconstruction and personalized code suggestion while revealing interesting patterns in student debugging behavior.</p></details> |  |

Our benchmark focuses on generating code for visualizing tabular data - such as a Pandas DataFrame - based on natural language instructions, complementing current evaluation tools and expanding their scope. The dataset includes 175 unique tasks. Our experiments assess several leading Large Language Models (LLMs) across three visualization libraries: Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. We show that the shortening of tasks has a minimal effect on plotting capabilities, allowing for the user interface that accommodates concise user input without sacrificing functionality or accuracy. Another of our findings reveals that while LLMs perform well with popular libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn, challenges persist with Plotly, highlighting areas for improvement. We hope that the modular design of our benchmark will broaden the current studies on generating visualizations.

| **[UniGenCoder: Merging Seq2Seq and Seq2Tree Paradigms for Unified Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12490v3)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning-based code generation has completely transformed the way developers write programs today. Existing approaches to code generation have focused either on the Sequence-to-Sequence paradigm, which generates target code as a sequence of tokens, or the Sequence-to-Tree paradigm, which outputs code as a sequence of actions. While these two paradigms are intuitively complementary, their combination has not been previously explored. By comparing the code generated under these two paradigms, we find that integrating them holds significant potential. In this paper, we propose UniGenCoder for code-related generation tasks, which consists of a shared encoder, a shared decoder with a minimal set of additional parameters to unify two paradigms, and a selector that dynamically chooses optimal paradigm for each instance. Also, during the model training, we first perform the multi-task learning and distillation strategies to facilitate knowledge transfer between two paradigms, and then leverage contrastive learning to train the selector. Experimental results on the text-to-code and code-to-code generation tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed model. We release our code at https://github.com/DeepLearnXMU/UniGenCoder.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted to 47th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2025), NIER track</p></details> |
| **[Detecting Essence Code Clones via Information Theoretic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19219v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code cloning, a widespread practice in software development, involves replicating code fragments to save time but often at the expense of software maintainability and quality. In this paper, we address the specific challenge of detecting "essence clones", a complex subtype of Type-3 clones characterized by sharing critical logic despite different peripheral codes. Traditional techniques often fail to detect essence clones due to their syntactic focus. To overcome this limitation, we introduce ECScan, a novel detection tool that leverages information theory to assess the semantic importance of code lines. By assigning weights to each line based on its information content, ECScan emphasizes core logic over peripheral code differences. Our comprehensive evaluation across various real-world projects shows that ECScan significantly outperforms existing tools in detecting essence clones, achieving an average F1-score of 85%. It demonstrates robust performance across all clone types and offers exceptional scalability. This study advances clone detection by providing a practical tool for developers to enhance code quality and reduce maintenance burdens, emphasizing the semantic aspects of code through an innovative information-theoretic approach.</p></details> |  |

However, studies have questioned their ability to produce secure code and, thereby, the quality of prompt-generated software. Alongside, various prompting techniques that carefully tailor prompts have emerged to elicit optimal responses from LLMs. Still, the interplay between such prompting strategies and secure code generation remains under-explored and calls for further investigations. OBJECTIVE: In this study, we investigate the impact of different prompting techniques on the security of code generated from NL instructions by LLMs. METHOD: First we perform a systematic literature review to identify the existing prompting techniques that can be used for code generation tasks. A subset of these techniques are evaluated on GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4 models for secure code generation. For this, we used an existing dataset consisting of 150 NL security-relevant code-generation prompts. RESULTS: Our work (i) classifies potential prompting techniques for code generation (ii) adapts and evaluates a subset of the identified techniques for secure code generation tasks and (iii) observes a reduction in security weaknesses across the tested LLMs, especially after using an existing technique called Recursive Criticism and Improvement (RCI), contributing valuable insights to the ongoing discourse on LLM-generated code security.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work partially supported by the EU-funded project Sec4AI4Sec: Cybersecurity for AI-Augmented Systems (grant no. 101120393) - ACCEPTED at ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (Feb. 2025)</p></details> |

Code generation not only facilitates faster prototyping and automated testing, but also augments developer efficiency through improved maintainability and reusability of code. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess the abilities of LLMs to adhere to task-oriented instructions within diverse code generation scenarios. CodeIF encompasses a broad range of tasks, including function synthesis, error debugging, algorithmic refactoring, and code explanation, thereby providing a comprehensive suite to evaluate model performance across varying complexity levels and programming domains. We conduct extensive experiments with LLMs, analyzing their strengths and limitations in meeting the demands of these tasks. The experimental results offer valuable insights into how well current models align with human instructions, as well as the extent to which they can generate consistent, maintainable, and contextually relevant code. Our findings not only underscore the critical role that instruction-following LLMs can play in modern software development, but also illuminate pathways for future research aimed at enhancing their adaptability, reliability, and overall effectiveness in automated code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Isolating Language-Coding from Problem-Solving: Benchmarking LLMs with PseudoEval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19149v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Existing code generation benchmarks for Large Language Models (LLMs) such as HumanEval and MBPP are designed to study LLMs' end-to-end performance, where the benchmarks feed a problem description in natural language as input and examine the generated code in specific programming languages. However, the evaluation scores revealed in this way provide a little hint as to the bottleneck of the code generation -- whether LLMs are struggling with their problem-solving capability or language-coding capability. To answer this question, we construct PseudoEval, a multilingual code generation benchmark that provides a solution written in pseudocode as input. By doing so, the bottleneck of code generation in various programming languages could be isolated and identified. Our study yields several interesting findings. For example, we identify that the bottleneck of LLMs in Python programming is problem-solving, while Rust is struggling relatively more in language-coding. Also, our study indicates that problem-solving capability may transfer across programming languages, while language-coding needs more language-specific effort, especially for undertrained programming languages. Finally, we release the pipeline of constructing PseudoEval to facilitate the extension to existing benchmarks. PseudoEval is available at: https://anonymous.4open.science/r/PseudocodeACL25-7B74.</p></details> |  |

For this reason, quantum error-correcting codes that handle asymmetric errors are critical to mitigating the impact of such impairments. To this aim, several asymmetric quantum codes have been proposed. These include variants of surface codes like the XZZX and ZZZY surface codes, tailored to preserve quantum information in the presence of error asymmetries. In this work, we propose two classes of Calderbank, Shor and Steane (CSS) topological codes, referred to as cylindrical and M\"obius codes, particular cases of the fiber bundle family. Cylindrical codes maintain a fully planar structure, while M\"obius codes are quasi-planar, with minimal non-local qubit interactions. We construct these codes employing the algebraic chain complexes formalism, providing theoretical upper bounds for the logical error rate. Our results demonstrate that cylindrical and M\"obius codes outperform standard surface codes when using the minimum weight perfect matching (MWPM) decoder.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 8 figures, submitted to a journal</p></details> |

As we advance towards agent-based development paradigms, these models form the cornerstone of next-generation software development lifecycles. However, current benchmarks for evaluating multilingual code generation capabilities are predominantly English-centric, limiting their applicability across the global developer community. To address this limitation, we present IndicEval-XL, a comprehensive benchmark for code generation that incorporates 6 major Indic languages, collectively spoken by approximately 14\% of the world's population. Our benchmark bridges these languages with 12 programming languages, creating a robust evaluation framework. This work is particularly significant given India's representation of one-eighth of the global population and the crucial role Indic languages play in Indian society. IndicEval-XL represents a significant step toward expanding the linguistic diversity in code generation systems and evaluation frameworks. By developing resources that support multiple languages, we aim to make AI-powered development tools more inclusive and accessible to developers of various linguistic backgrounds. To facilitate further research and development in this direction, we make our dataset and evaluation benchmark publicly available at https://github.com/telekom/IndicEval-XL</p></details> |  |

Biomedical code mapping identifies similarity or equivalence between concepts from different ontologies. Obtaining high-quality mapping usually relies on automatic generation of unrefined mapping with ontology domain fine-tuned language models (LMs), followed by manual selections or corrections by coding experts who have extensive domain expertise and familiarity with ontology schemas. The LMs usually provide unrefined code mapping suggestions as a list of candidates without reasoning or supporting evidence, hence coding experts still need to verify each suggested candidate against ontology sources to pick the best matches. This is also a recurring task as ontology sources are updated regularly to incorporate new research findings. Consequently, the need of regular LM retraining and manual refinement make code mapping time-consuming and labour intensive. In this work, we created OntologyRAG, an ontology-enhanced retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) method that leverages the inductive biases from ontological knowledge graphs for in-context-learning (ICL) in large language models (LLMs). Our solution grounds LLMs to knowledge graphs with unrefined mappings between ontologies and processes questions by generating an interpretable set of results that include prediction rational with mapping proximity assessment. Our solution doesn't require re-training LMs, as all ontology updates could be reflected by updating the knowledge graphs with a standard process. Evaluation results on a self-curated gold dataset show promises of using our method to enable coding experts to achieve better and faster code mapping. The code is available at https://github.com/iqvianlp/ontologyRAG.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted as a workshop paper for KEIR@ECIR 2025</p></details> |

Existing Mandarin-English code-switching datasets often suffer from limitations in size, spontaneity, and the lack of full-length dialogue recordings with transcriptions, hindering the development of robust ASR models for real-world conversational scenarios. This paper introduces CS-Dialogue, a novel large-scale Mandarin-English code-switching speech dataset comprising 104 hours of spontaneous conversations from 200 speakers. Unlike previous datasets, CS-Dialogue provides full-length dialogue recordings with complete transcriptions, capturing naturalistic code-switching patterns in continuous speech. We describe the data collection and annotation processes, present detailed statistics of the dataset, and establish benchmark ASR performance using state-of-the-art models. Our experiments, using Transformer, Conformer, and Branchformer, demonstrate the challenges of code-switching ASR, and show that existing pre-trained models such as Whisper still have the space to improve. The CS-Dialogue dataset will be made freely available for all academic purposes.</p></details> |  |

However, training and testing distributions often differ, as training datasets rarely encompass the entire distribution, while testing distribution tends to shift over time. Hence, when confronted with out-of-distribution (OOD) instances that differ from the training data, a reliable and trustworthy SE ML model must be capable of detecting them to either abstain from making predictions, or potentially forward these OODs to appropriate models handling other categories or tasks. In this paper, we develop two types of SE-specific OOD detection models, unsupervised and weakly-supervised OOD detection for code. The unsupervised OOD detection approach is trained solely on in-distribution samples while the weakly-supervised approach utilizes a tiny number of OOD samples to further enhance the detection performance in various OOD scenarios. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed methods significantly outperform the baselines in detecting OOD samples from four different scenarios simultaneously and also positively impact a main code understanding task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Marking Code Without Breaking It: Code Watermarking for Detecting LLM-Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18851v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code watermarking identifies AI-generated code by embedding patterns into the code during generation. Effective watermarking requires meeting two key conditions: the watermark should be reliably detectable, and the code should retain its original functionality. However, existing methods often modify tokens that are critical for program logic, such as keywords in conditional expressions or operators in arithmetic computations. These modifications can cause syntax errors or functional failures, limiting the practical use of watermarking. We present STONE, a method that preserves functional integrity by selectively inserting watermarks only into non-syntax tokens. By excluding tokens essential for code execution, STONE minimizes the risk of functional degradation. In addition, we introduce CWEM, a comprehensive evaluation metric that evaluates watermarking techniques based on correctness, detectability, and naturalness. While correctness and detectability have been widely used, naturalness remains underexplored despite its importance. Unnatural patterns can reveal the presence of a watermark, making it easier for adversaries to remove. We evaluate STONE using CWEM and compare its performance with the state-of-the-art approach. The results show that STONE achieves an average improvement of 7.69% in CWEM across Python, C++, and Java. Our code is available in https://github.com/inistory/STONE-watermarking/.</p></details> |  |
| **[MKE-Coder: Multi-Axial Knowledge with Evidence Verification in ICD Coding for Chinese EMRs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14916v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The task of automatically coding the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) in the medical field has been well-established and has received much attention. Automatic coding of the ICD in the medical field has been successful in English but faces challenges when dealing with Chinese electronic medical records (EMRs). The first issue lies in the difficulty of extracting disease code-related information from Chinese EMRs, primarily due to the concise writing style and specific internal structure of the EMRs. The second problem is that previous methods have failed to leverage the disease-based multi-axial knowledge and lack of association with the corresponding clinical evidence. This paper introduces a novel framework called MKE-Coder: Multi-axial Knowledge with Evidence verification in ICD coding for Chinese EMRs. Initially, we identify candidate codes for the diagnosis and categorize each of them into knowledge under four coding axes.Subsequently, we retrieve corresponding clinical evidence from the comprehensive content of EMRs and filter credible evidence through a scoring model. Finally, to ensure the validity of the candidate code, we propose an inference module based on the masked language modeling strategy. This module verifies that all the axis knowledge associated with the candidate code is supported by evidence and provides recommendations accordingly. To evaluate the performance of our framework, we conduct experiments using a large-scale Chinese EMR dataset collected from various hospitals. The experimental results demonstrate that MKE-Coder exhibits significant superiority in the task of automatic ICD coding based on Chinese EMRs. In the practical evaluation of our method within simulated real coding scenarios, it has been demonstrated that our approach significantly aids coders in enhancing both their coding accuracy and speed.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing approaches focus on mainstream languages such as Python and Java, neglecting the Solidity language, the predominant programming language for Ethereum smart contracts. Due to the lack of adequate benchmarks for Solidity, LLMs' ability to generate secure, cost-effective smart contracts remains unexplored. To fill this gap, we construct SolEval, the first repository-level benchmark designed for Solidity smart contract generation, to evaluate the performance of LLMs on Solidity. SolEval consists of 1,125 samples from 9 different repositories, covering 6 popular domains, providing LLMs with a comprehensive evaluation benchmark. Unlike the existing Solidity benchmark, SolEval not only includes complex function calls but also reflects the real-world complexity of the Ethereum ecosystem by incorporating gas fee and vulnerability rate. We evaluate 10 LLMs on SolEval, and our results show that the best-performing LLM achieves only 26.29% Pass@10, highlighting substantial room for improvement in Solidity code generation by LLMs. We release our data and code at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/SolEval-1C06/.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Existence of Galois Self-Dual GRS and TGRS Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2210.10562v4)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Let $q=p^m$ be a prime power and $e$ be an integer with $0\leq e\leq m-1$. $e$-Galois self-dual codes are generalizations of Euclidean $(e=0)$ and Hermitian ($e=\frac{m}{2}$ with even $m$) self-dual codes. In this paper, for a linear code $\C$ and a nonzero vector $\bm{u}\in \F_q^n$, we give a sufficient and necessary condition for the dual extended code $\underline{\C}[\bm{u}]$ of $\C$ to be $e$-Galois self-orthogonal. From this, a new systematic approach is proposed to prove the existence of $e$-Galois self-dual codes. By this method, we prove that $e$-Galois self-dual (extended) generalized Reed-Solomon (GRS) codes of length $n>\min\{p^e+1,p^{m-e}+1\}$ do not exist, where $1\leq e\leq m-1$. Moreover, based on the non-GRS properties of twisted GRS (TGRS) codes, we show that in many cases $e$-Galois self-dual (extended) TGRS codes do not exist. Furthermore, we present a sufficient and necessary condition for $(\ast)$-TGRS codes to be Hermitian self-dual, and then construct several new classes of Hermitian self-dual $(+)$-TGRS and $(\ast)$-TGRS codes.</p></details> | 22 pages |
| **[Unveiling the Magic of Code Reasoning through Hypothesis Decomposition and Amendment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13170v2)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reasoning abilities are one of the most enigmatic and captivating aspects of large language models (LLMs). Numerous studies are dedicated to exploring and expanding the boundaries of this reasoning capability. However, tasks that embody both reasoning and recall characteristics are often overlooked. In this paper, we introduce such a novel task, code reasoning, to provide a new perspective for the reasoning abilities of LLMs. We summarize three meta-benchmarks based on established forms of logical reasoning, and instantiate these into eight specific benchmark tasks. Our testing on these benchmarks reveals that LLMs continue to struggle with identifying satisfactory reasoning pathways. Additionally, we present a new pathway exploration pipeline inspired by human intricate problem-solving methods. This Reflective Hypothesis Decomposition and Amendment (RHDA) pipeline consists of the following iterative steps: (1) Proposing potential hypotheses based on observations and decomposing them; (2) Utilizing tools to validate hypotheses and reflection outcomes; (3) Revising hypothesis in light of observations. Our approach effectively mitigates logical chain collapses arising from forgetting or hallucination issues in multi-step reasoning, resulting in performance gains of up to $3\times$. Finally, we expanded this pipeline by applying it to simulate complex household tasks in real-world scenarios, specifically in VirtualHome, enhancing the handling of failure cases. We release our code and all of results at https://github.com/TnTWoW/code_reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Poster;23 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[Deep-Bench: Deep Learning Benchmark Dataset for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18726v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) has revolutionized areas such as computer vision, natural language processing, and more. However, developing DL systems is challenging due to the complexity of DL workflows. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as GPT, Claude, Llama, Mistral, etc., have emerged as promising tools to assist in DL code generation, offering potential solutions to these challenges. Despite this, existing benchmarks such as DS-1000 are limited, as they primarily focus on small DL code snippets related to pre/post-processing tasks and lack a comprehensive coverage of the full DL pipeline, including different DL phases and input data types. To address this, we introduce DeepBench, a novel benchmark dataset designed for function-level DL code generation. DeepBench categorizes DL problems based on three key aspects: phases such as pre-processing, model construction, and training; tasks, including classification, regression, and recommendation; and input data types such as tabular, image, and text. GPT-4o -- the state-of-the-art LLM -- achieved 31% accuracy on DeepBench, significantly lower than its 60% on DS-1000. We observed similar difficulty for other LLMs (e.g., 28% vs. 54% for Claude, 21% vs. 41% for LLaMA, and 15% vs. 20% for Mistral). This result underscores DeepBench's greater complexity. We also construct a taxonomy of issues and bugs found in LLM-generated DL code, which highlights the distinct challenges that LLMs face when generating DL code compared to general code. Furthermore, our analysis also reveals substantial performance variations across categories, with differences of up to 7% among phases and 37% among tasks. These disparities suggest that DeepBench offers valuable insights into the LLMs' performance and areas for potential improvement in the DL domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Knowledge Component Generation and Knowledge Tracing for Coding Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18632v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Knowledge components (KCs) mapped to problems help model student learning, tracking their mastery levels on fine-grained skills thereby facilitating personalized learning and feedback in online learning platforms. However, crafting and tagging KCs to problems, traditionally performed by human domain experts, is highly labor-intensive. We present a fully automated, LLM-based pipeline for KC generation and tagging for open-ended programming problems. We also develop an LLM-based knowledge tracing (KT) framework to leverage these LLM-generated KCs, which we refer to as KCGen-KT. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations validating the effectiveness of KCGen-KT. On a real-world dataset of student code submissions to open-ended programming problems, KCGen-KT outperforms existing KT methods. We investigate the learning curves of generated KCs and show that LLM-generated KCs have a comparable level-of-fit to human-written KCs under the performance factor analysis (PFA) model. We also conduct a human evaluation to show that the KC tagging accuracy of our pipeline is reasonably accurate when compared to that by human domain experts.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Benchmarks Talk: Re-Evaluating Code LLMs with Interactive Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18413v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Programming is a fundamentally interactive process, yet coding assistants are often evaluated using static benchmarks that fail to measure how well models collaborate with users. We introduce an interactive evaluation pipeline to examine how LLMs incorporate different types of feedback in a collaborative setting. Specifically, we perturb static coding benchmarks so that the code model must interact with a simulated user to retrieve key information about the problem. We find that interaction significantly affects model performance, as the relative rankings of 10 models across 3 datasets often vary between static and interactive settings, despite models being fairly robust to feedback that contains errors. We also observe that even when different feedback types are equally effective with respect to performance, they can impact model behaviors such as (1) how models respond to higher- vs. lower-quality feedback and (2) whether models prioritize aesthetic vs. functional edits. Our work aims to "re-evaluate" model coding capabilities through an interactive lens toward bridging the gap between existing evaluations and real-world usage.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Does Code Pretraining Affect Language Model Task Performance?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04556v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models are increasingly trained on corpora containing both natural language and non-linguistic data like source code. Aside from aiding programming-related tasks, anecdotal evidence suggests that including code in pretraining corpora may improve performance on other, unrelated tasks, yet to date no work has been able to establish a causal connection by controlling between language and code data. Here we do just this. We pretrain language models on datasets which interleave natural language and code in two different settings: additive, in which the total volume of data seen during pretraining is held constant; and competitive, in which the volume of language data is held constant. We study how the pretraining mixture affects performance on (a) a diverse collection of tasks included in the BigBench benchmark, and (b) compositionality, measured by generalization accuracy on semantic parsing and syntactic transformations. We find that pretraining on higher proportions of code improves performance on compositional tasks involving structured output (like semantic parsing), and mathematics. Conversely, increase code mixture can harm performance on other tasks, including on tasks that requires sensitivity to linguistic structure such as syntax or morphology, and tasks measuring real-world knowledge.</p></details> |  |

Unlike existing datasets that are limited to either file-level RTL code or physical layout data, DeepCircuitX provides a holistic, multilevel resource that spans repository, file, module, and block-level RTL code. This structure enables more nuanced training and evaluation of large language models (LLMs) for RTL-specific tasks. DeepCircuitX is enriched with Chain of Thought (CoT) annotations, offering detailed descriptions of functionality and structure at multiple levels. These annotations enhance its utility for a wide range of tasks, including RTL code understanding, generation, and completion. Additionally, the dataset includes synthesized netlists and PPA metrics, facilitating early-stage design exploration and enabling accurate PPA prediction directly from RTL code. We demonstrate the dataset's effectiveness on various LLMs finetuned with our dataset and confirm the quality with human evaluations. Our results highlight DeepCircuitX as a critical resource for advancing RTL-focused machine learning applications in hardware design automation.Our data is available at https://zeju.gitbook.io/lcm-team.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Serializing Java Objects in Plain Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11294v3)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In managed languages, serialization of objects is typically done in bespoke binary formats such as Protobuf, or markup languages such as XML or JSON. The major limitation of these formats is readability. Human developers cannot read binary code, and in most cases, suffer from the syntax of XML or JSON. This is a major issue when objects are meant to be embedded and read in source code, such as in test cases. To address this problem, we propose plain-code serialization. Our core idea is to serialize objects observed at runtime in the native syntax of a programming language. We realize this vision in the context of Java, and demonstrate a prototype which serializes Java objects to Java source code. The resulting source faithfully reconstructs the objects seen at runtime. Our prototype is called ProDJ and is publicly available. We experiment with ProDJ to successfully plain-code serialize 174,699 objects observed during the execution of 4 open-source Java applications. Our performance measurement shows that the performance impact is not noticeable. Through a user study, we demonstrate that developers prefer plain-code serialized objects within automatically generated tests over their representations as XML or JSON.</p></details> | Under peer-review |

This structure reduces the bandwidth requirements at the server, which is a bottleneck in conventional gradient coding systems. In this paper, the intermediate nodes, referred to as $\textit{relays}$, process the data received from workers and send the results to the server for the final gradient computation. Our main contribution is deriving the optimal communication-computation trade-off by designing a linear coding scheme inspired by coded computing techniques, considering straggling and adversarial nodes among both relays and workers. The processing of the data in the relays makes it possible to achieve both the relay-to-server and the worker-to-relay communication loads simultaneously optimal with regard to the computation load.</p></details> | <details><summary>Partl...</summary><p>Partly submitted to ISIT 2025</p></details> |

Hansen in 2000. They are produced by evaluating (a vector space composed by) polynomials at the points of $(\mathbb{F}_q^*)^s$, the monomials of these polynomials being related to a certain polytope. Toric codes related to hypersimplices are the result of the evaluation of a vector space of homogeneous monomially square-free polynomials of degree $d$. The dimension and minimum distance of toric codes related to hypersimplices have been determined by Jaramillo et al. in 2021. The next-to-minimal weight in the case $d = 1$ has been determined by Jaramillo-Velez et al. in 2023, and has been determined in the cases where $3 \leq d \leq \frac{s - 2}{2}$ or $\frac{s + 2}{2} \leq d < s$, by Carvalho and Patanker in 2024. In this work we characterize and determine the number of minimal (respectively, next-to-minimal) weight codewords when $3 \leq d < s$ (respectively, $3 \leq d \leq \frac{s - 2}{2}$ or $\frac{s + 2}{2} \leq d < s$).</p></details> |  |

For a code $\mathcal{C}$ over these rings, we associate a binary code $\mathcal{C}_a$ and a ternary code $\mathcal{C}_b$. We characterize self-orthogonal, self-dual and quasi self-dual (QSD) codes over these rings using the codes $\mathcal{C}_a$ and $\mathcal{C}_b$. In addition, we present a building-up construction for self-orthogonal codes, introduce cyclic codes and linear complementary dual (LCD) codes. We also gave a classification of self-orthogonal codes for short lengths.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs can generate license-protected code without providing the necessary license information, leading to potential intellectual property violations during software production. This paper addresses the critical, yet underexplored, issue of license compliance in LLM-generated code by establishing a benchmark to evaluate the ability of LLMs to provide accurate license information for their generated code. To establish this benchmark, we conduct an empirical study to identify a reasonable standard for "striking similarity" that excludes the possibility of independent creation, indicating a copy relationship between the LLM output and certain open-source code. Based on this standard, we propose LiCoEval, to evaluate the license compliance capabilities of LLMs, i.e., the ability to provide accurate license or copyright information when they generate code with striking similarity to already existing copyrighted code. Using LiCoEval, we evaluate 14 popular LLMs, finding that even top-performing LLMs produce a non-negligible proportion (0.88% to 2.01%) of code strikingly similar to existing open-source implementations. Notably, most LLMs fail to provide accurate license information, particularly for code under copyleft licenses. These findings underscore the urgent need to enhance LLM compliance capabilities in code generation tasks. Our study provides a foundation for future research and development to improve license compliance in AI-assisted software development, contributing to both the protection of open-source software copyrights and the mitigation of legal risks for LLM users.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 4...</summary><p>The 47th International Conference on Software Engineering(ICSE 2025)</p></details> |

This systematic literature review identifies existing instructional approaches, their objectives, and the strategies used for measuring their effectiveness. Building on an existing mapping study of code quality in education, we identified 53 papers on code structure instruction. We classified these studies into three categories: (1) studies focused on developing or evaluating automated tools and their usage (e.g., code analyzers, tutors, and refactoring tools), (2) studies discussing other instructional materials, such as learning resources (e.g., refactoring lessons and activities), rubrics, and catalogs of violations, and (3) studies discussing how to integrate code structure into the curriculum through a holistic approach to course design to support code quality. While most approaches use analyzers that point students to problems in their code, incorporating these tools into classrooms is not straightforward. Combined with further research on code structure instruction in the classroom, we call for more studies on effectiveness. Over 40% of instructional studies had no evaluation. Many studies show promise for their interventions by demonstrating improvement in student performance (e.g., reduced violations in student code when using the intervention compared with code that was written without access to the intervention). These interventions warrant further investigation on learning, to see how students apply their knowledge after the instructional supports are removed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 IEEE/ACM 37th International Conference on Software Engineering Education and Training (CSEE&T)</p></details> |

Based on this perspective, we propose SCATTERED FOREST SEARCH (SFS), a novel approach that improves solution diversity and better exploits feedback during evolutionary search. Our theoretical analysis illustrates how these methods help avoid local optima during optimization, leading to more efficient exploration. Extensive experiments on HumanEval, MBPP, APPS, CodeContests, and Leetcode reveal significant performance gains. For instance, our method achieves a pass@1 rate of 67.1% on HumanEval+ and 87.2% on HumanEval with GPT-3.5, marking improvements of 8.6% and 4.3% over the state-of-the-art, while also halving the iterations needed to find the correct solution.

However, improvement is plateauing due to the exhaustion of readily available high-quality data. Prior work has shown the potential of synthetic self-instruct data, but naively training on a model's own outputs can cause error accumulation, especially in coding tasks, where generalization may collapse due to overly simple or erroneous training data, highlighting the need for rigorous quality checks on synthetic data. In this work, we explore an effective approach whereby the model itself verifies the correctness of its own data. We thus propose Sol-Ver, a self-play solver-verifier framework that jointly improves a single model's code and test generation capacity. By iteratively refining code (LLM-as-a-solver) and tests (LLM-as-a-verifier) together, we boost both capabilities without relying on human annotations or larger teacher models. Experiments with the Llama 3.1 8B model demonstrate substantial performance enhancements, achieving average relative improvements of 19.63% in code generation and 17.49% in test generation on MBPP and LiveCodeBench.</p></details> | 13 pages, 5 figures |

Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate code translation between different pairs of PLs. However, the rules can become obsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs. Recent studies have explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs). One key observation is that such techniques may work well for crafted benchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-world projects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc. We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-level code translation. AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employs multiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves the functionality of the source program. To break down the problem for LLMs, AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragments and translates them in the reverse call order. We leveraged AlphaTrans to translate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of <836, 8575, 2719> classes, methods, and tests. AlphaTrans breaks down these projects into 17874 fragments and translates the entire repository. 96.40% of the translated fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validates the translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 27.03% and 25.14% of fragments. On average, the integrated translation and validation take 34 hours to translate a project, showing its scalability in practice. For the incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report including existing translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures. We provided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in four projects. They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieve all passing tests.</p></details> |  |

The core of RAG is retrieving demonstration examples, which is essential to balance effectiveness (generation quality) and efficiency (retrieval time) for optimal performance. However, the high-dimensional nature of code representations and large knowledge bases often create efficiency bottlenecks, which are overlooked in previous research. This paper systematically evaluates the efficiency-effectiveness trade-off of retrievers across three coding tasks: Program Synthesis, Commit Message Generation, and Assertion Generation. We examined six retrievers: two sparse (BM25 and BM25L) and four dense retrievers, including one exhaustive dense retriever (SBERT's Semantic Search) and three approximate dense retrievers (ANNOY, LSH, and HNSW). Our findings show that while BM25 excels in effectiveness, it suffers in efficiency as the knowledge base grows beyond 1000 entries. In large-scale retrieval, efficiency differences become more pronounced, with approximate dense retrievers offering the greatest gains. For instance, in Commit Generation task, HNSW achieves a 44x speed up, while only with a 1.74% drop in RougeL compared with BM25. Our results also show that increasing the number of demonstrations in the prompt doesn't always improve the effectiveness and can increase latency and lead to incorrect outputs. Our findings provide valuable insights for practitioners aiming to build efficient and effective RAG systems for coding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables, accepted by SANER 2025</p></details> |

The primary research question is whether lightweight, locally executed LLMs can generate correct Python code for these tasks. To assess this, we compared locally run models against state-of-the-art alternatives, such as GPT-4 and DeepSeek-V3, which served as reference points. By extracting and executing the Python functions generated by each model, we evaluated their outputs on a zero-to-five scale. Results show that while DeepSeek-V3 and GPT-4 consistently provided accurate solutions, certain smaller models-particularly Phi-4 and LLaMA-3.3-also demonstrated strong performance, underscoring the viability of lightweight alternatives. Other models exhibited errors stemming from incomplete understanding or syntactic issues. These findings illustrate the potential of LLM-based approaches for specialized engineering applications while highlighting the need for careful model selection, rigorous prompt design, and targeted domain fine-tuning to achieve reliable outcomes.</p></details> |  |

This paper considers $(\gamma,\Delta)$-cyclic codes over a class of finite non-chain commutative rings $\mathscr{R}_{q,s}=\mathbb{F}_q[v_1,v_2,\dots,v_s]/\langle v_i-v_i^2,v_iv_j=v_jv_i=0\rangle$ where $\gamma$ is an automorphism of $\mathscr{R}_{q,s}$, $\Delta$ is a $\gamma$-derivation of $\mathscr{R}_{q,s}$ and $1\leq i\neq j\leq s$ for a positive integer $s$. Here, we show that a $(\gamma,\Delta)$-cyclic code of length $n$ over $\mathscr{R}_{q,s}$ is the direct sum of $(\theta,\Im)$-cyclic codes of length $n$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$, where $\theta$ is an automorphism of $\mathbb{F}_q$ and $\Im$ is a $\theta$-derivation of $\mathbb{F}_q$. Further, necessary and sufficient conditions for both $(\gamma,\Delta)$-cyclic and $(\theta,\Im)$-cyclic codes to contain their Euclidean duals are established. Then, we obtain many quantum codes by applying the dual containing criterion on the Gray images of these codes. These codes have better parameters than those available in the literature. Finally, the encoding and error-correction procedures for our proposed quantum codes are discussed.</p></details> | 24 |

To help novices with animation, we present LogoMotion, an AI code generation approach that helps users create semantically meaningful animation for logos. LogoMotion automatically generates animation code with a method called visually-grounded code synthesis and program repair. This method performs visual analysis, instantiates a design concept, and conducts visual checking to generate animation code. LogoMotion provides novices with code-connected AI editing widgets that help them edit the motion, grouping, and timing of their animation. In a comparison study on 276 animations, LogoMotion was found to produce more content-aware animation than an industry-leading tool. In a user evaluation (n=16) comparing against a prompt-only baseline, these code-connected widgets helped users edit animations with control, iteration, and creative expression.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fundamental Trade-off Between Computation and Communication in Private Coded Distributed Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17195v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed computing enables scalable machine learning by distributing tasks across multiple nodes, but ensuring privacy in such systems remains a challenge. This paper introduces a private coded distributed computing model that integrates privacy constraints to keep task assignments hidden. By leveraging placement delivery arrays (PDAs), we design an extended PDA framework to characterize achievable computation and communication loads under privacy constraints. By constructing two classes of extended PDAs, we explore the trade-offs between computation and communication, showing that although privacy increases communication overhead, it can be significantly alleviated through optimized PDA-based coded strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeSwift: Accelerating LLM Inference for Efficient Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17139v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation is a latency-sensitive task that demands high timeliness, but the autoregressive decoding mechanism of Large Language Models (LLMs) leads to poor inference efficiency. Existing LLM inference acceleration methods mainly focus on standalone functions using only built-in components. Moreover, they treat code like natural language sequences, ignoring its unique syntax and semantic characteristics. As a result, the effectiveness of these approaches in code generation tasks remains limited and fails to align with real-world programming scenarios. To alleviate this issue, we propose CodeSwift, a simple yet highly efficient inference acceleration approach specifically designed for code generation, without comprising the quality of the output. CodeSwift constructs a multi-source datastore, providing access to both general and project-specific knowledge, facilitating the retrieval of high-quality draft sequences. Moreover, CodeSwift reduces retrieval cost by controlling retrieval timing, and enhances efficiency through parallel retrieval and a context- and LLM preference-aware cache. Experimental results show that CodeSwift can reach up to 2.53x and 2.54x speedup compared to autoregressive decoding in repository-level and standalone code generation tasks, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art inference acceleration approaches by up to 88%.</p></details> |  |
| **[MdEval: Massively Multilingual Code Debugging](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.02310v2)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code large language models (LLMs) have made significant progress in code debugging by directly generating the correct code based on the buggy code snippet. Programming benchmarks, typically consisting of buggy code snippet and their associated test cases, are used to assess the debugging capabilities of LLMs. However, many existing benchmarks primarily focus on Python and are often limited in terms of language diversity (e.g., DebugBench and DebugEval). To advance the field of multilingual debugging with LLMs, we propose the first massively multilingual debugging benchmark, which includes 3.6K test samples of 18 programming languages and covers the automated program repair (APR) task, the code review (CR) task, and the bug identification (BI) task. Further, we introduce the debugging instruction corpora MDEVAL-INSTRUCT by injecting bugs into the correct multilingual queries and solutions (xDebugGen). Further, a multilingual debugger xDebugCoder trained on MDEVAL-INSTRUCT as a strong baseline specifically to handle the bugs of a wide range of programming languages (e.g. "Missing Mut" in language Rust and "Misused Macro Definition" in language C). Our extensive experiments on MDEVAL reveal a notable performance gap between open-source models and closed-source LLMs (e.g., GPT and Claude series), highlighting huge room for improvement in multilingual code debugging scenarios.</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Optimal redundancy of function-correcting codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16983v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function-correcting codes, introduced by Lenz, Bitar, Wachter-Zeh, and Yaakobi, protect specific function values of a message rather than the entire message. A central challenge is determining the optimal redundancy -- the minimum additional information required to recover function values amid errors. This redundancy depends on both the number of correctable errors $t$ and the structure of message vectors yielding identical function values. While prior works established bounds, key questions remain, such as the optimal redundancy for functions like Hamming weight and Hamming weight distribution, along with efficient code constructions. In this paper, we make the following contributions: (1) For the Hamming weight function, we improve the lower bound on optimal redundancy from $\frac{10(t-1)}{3}$ to $4t - \frac{4}{3}\sqrt{6t+2} + 2$. On the other hand, we provide a systematical approach to constructing explicit FCCs via a novel connection with Gray codes, which also improve the previous upper bound from $\frac{4t-2}{1 - 2\sqrt{\log{2t}/(2t)}}$ to $4t - \log{t}$. Consequently, we almost determine the optimal redundancy for Hamming weight function. (2) The Hamming weight distribution function is defined by the value of Hamming weight divided by a given positive integer $T$. Previous work established that the optimal redundancy is $2t$ when $T > 2t$, while the case $T \le 2t$ remained unclear. We show that the optimal redundancy remains $2t$ when $T \ge t+1$. However, in the surprising regime where $T = o(t)$, we achieve near-optimal redundancy of $4t - o(t)$. Our results reveal a significant distinction in behavior of redundancy for distinct choices of $T$.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Detecting Code Vulnerabilities with Heterogeneous GNN Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16835v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Detecting vulnerabilities in source code is a critical task for software security assurance. Graph Neural Network (GNN) machine learning can be a promising approach by modeling source code as graphs. Early approaches treated code elements uniformly, limiting their capacity to model diverse relationships that contribute to various vulnerabilities. Recent research addresses this limitation by considering the heterogeneity of node types and using Gated Graph Neural Networks (GGNN) to aggregate node information through different edge types. However, these edges primarily function as conduits for passing node information and may not capture detailed characteristics of distinct edge types. This paper presents Inter-Procedural Abstract Graphs (IPAGs) as an efficient, language-agnostic representation of source code, complemented by heterogeneous GNN training for vulnerability prediction. IPAGs capture the structural and contextual properties of code elements and their relationships. We also propose a Heterogeneous Attention GNN (HAGNN) model that incorporates multiple subgraphs capturing different features of source code. These subgraphs are learned separately and combined using a global attention mechanism, followed by a fully connected neural network for final classification. The proposed approach has achieved up to 96.6% accuracy on a large C dataset of 108 vulnerability types and 97.8% on a large Java dataset of 114 vulnerability types, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Its applications to various real-world software projects have also demonstrated low false positive rates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code Summarization Beyond Function Level](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16704v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code summarization is a critical task in natural language processing and software engineering, which aims to generate concise descriptions of source code. Recent advancements have improved the quality of these summaries, enhancing code readability and maintainability. However, the content of a repository or a class has not been considered in function code summarization. This study investigated the effectiveness of code summarization models beyond the function level, exploring the impact of class and repository contexts on the summary quality. The study involved revising benchmarks for evaluating models at class and repository levels, assessing baseline models, and evaluating LLMs with in-context learning to determine the enhancement of summary quality with additional context. The findings revealed that the fine-tuned state-of-the-art CodeT5+ base model excelled in code summarization, while incorporating few-shot learning and retrieved code chunks from RAG significantly enhanced the performance of LLMs in this task. Notably, the Deepseek Coder 1.3B and Starcoder2 15B models demonstrated substantial improvements in metrics such as BLEURT, METEOR, and BLEU-4 at both class and repository levels. Repository-level summarization exhibited promising potential but necessitates significant computational resources and gains from the inclusion of structured context. Lastly, we employed the recent SIDE code summarization metric in our evaluation. This study contributes to refining strategies for prompt engineering, few-shot learning, and RAG, addressing gaps in benchmarks for code summarization at various levels. Finally, we publish all study details, code, datasets, and results of evaluation in the GitHub repository available at https://github.com/kilimanj4r0/code-summarization-beyond-function-level.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to LLM4Code @ ICSE'25; 8 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

At each step/turn, by leveraging the code execution outputs and programs of previous steps, the model generates the next sub-task and the corresponding program to solve it. This way, SBSC, sequentially navigates to reach the final answer. SBSC allows more granular, flexible and precise approach to problem-solving compared to existing methods. Extensive experiments highlight the effectiveness of SBSC in tackling competition and Olympiad-level math problems. For Claude-3.5-Sonnet, we observe SBSC (greedy decoding) surpasses existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) program generation based reasoning strategies by absolute 10.7% on AMC12, 8% on AIME and 12.6% on MathOdyssey. Given SBSC is multi-turn in nature, we also benchmark SBSC's greedy decoding against self-consistency decoding results of existing SOTA math reasoning strategies and observe performance gain by absolute 6.2% on AMC, 6.7% on AIME and 7.4% on MathOdyssey.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a full conference paper at ICLR 2025.

| **[Teaching Loop Testing to Young Learners with the Code Critters Mutation Testing Game](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16655v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serious games can teach essential coding and testing concepts even to younger audiences. In the Code Critter game critters execute short snippets of block-based code while traversing the game map, and players position magical portals (akin to test oracles) at locations (akin to test inputs) to distinguish between critters executing correct code from those who execute faulty code. However, this adaptation of the tower defense genre limits code under test to basic sequences and branches, and excludes the fundamental programming concept of loops. To address this limitation, in this paper we introduce an entirely new game concept integrated into the Code Critters storyline, tasking players to test the behavior of critters collecting ingredients for a healing potion using loop-based recipes at a second-stage level. In a study involving 29 secondary school students, we observed active engagement with these new loop-integrated levels. The results highlight challenges the students face, which can inform future strategies for improving coding and testing education.</p></details> |  |
| **[CODESYNC: Synchronizing Large Language Models with Dynamic Code Evolution at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16645v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have exhibited exceptional performance in software engineering yet face challenges in adapting to continually evolving code knowledge, particularly regarding the frequent updates of third-party library APIs. This limitation, stemming from static pre-training datasets, often results in non-executable code or implementations with suboptimal safety and efficiency. To this end, this paper introduces CODESYNC, a data engine for identifying outdated code patterns and collecting real-time code knowledge updates from Python third-party libraries. Building upon CODESYNC, we develop CODESYNCBENCH, a comprehensive benchmark for assessing LLMs' ability to stay synchronized with code evolution, which covers real-world updates for 220 APIs from six Python libraries. Our benchmark offers 3,300 test cases across three evaluation tasks and an update-aware instruction tuning dataset consisting of 2,200 training samples. Extensive experiments on 14 state-of-the-art LLMs reveal that they struggle with dynamic code evolution, even with the support of advanced knowledge updating methods (e.g., DPO, ORPO, and SimPO). We believe that our benchmark can offer a strong foundation for the development of more effective methods for real-time code knowledge updating in the future. The experimental code and dataset are publicly available at: https://github.com/Lucky-voyage/Code-Sync.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeCriticBench: A Holistic Code Critique Benchmark for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16614v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The critique capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) is essential for reasoning abilities, which can provide necessary suggestions (e.g., detailed analysis and constructive feedback). Therefore, how to evaluate the critique capacity of LLMs has drawn great attention and several critique benchmarks have been proposed. However, existing critique benchmarks usually have the following limitations: (1). Focusing on diverse reasoning tasks in general domains and insufficient evaluation on code tasks (e.g., only covering code generation task), where the difficulty of queries is relatively easy (e.g., the code queries of CriticBench are from Humaneval and MBPP). (2). Lacking comprehensive evaluation from different dimensions. To address these limitations, we introduce a holistic code critique benchmark for LLMs called CodeCriticBench. Specifically, our CodeCriticBench includes two mainstream code tasks (i.e., code generation and code QA) with different difficulties. Besides, the evaluation protocols include basic critique evaluation and advanced critique evaluation for different characteristics, where fine-grained evaluation checklists are well-designed for advanced settings. Finally, we conduct extensive experimental results of existing LLMs, which show the effectiveness of CodeCriticBench.</p></details> |  |

We study $(\text{\textbaro},\mathfrak{d}, \gamma)$-constacyclic codes over the ring $\mathfrak{R}=\mathbb{Z}_4+\omega\mathbb{Z}_4, \omega^2=\omega,$ with an $\mathfrak{R}$-automorphism $\text{\textbaro}$ and a $\text{\textbaro}$-derivation $\mathfrak{d}$ over $\mathfrak{R}.$ Further, we determine the generators of the $(\text{\textbaro},\mathfrak{d}, \gamma)$-constacyclic codes over the ring $\mathfrak{R}$ of any arbitrary length and establish the reverse constraint for these codes. Besides the necessary and sufficient criterion to derive reverse-complement codes, we present a construction to obtain DNA codes from these reversible codes. Moreover, we use another construction on the $(\text{\textbaro},\mathfrak{d},\gamma)$-constacyclic codes to generate additional optimal and new classical codes. Finally, we provide several examples of $(\text{\textbaro},\mathfrak{d}, \gamma)$ constacyclic codes and construct DNA codes from established results. The parameters of these linear codes over $\mathbb{Z}_4$ are better and optimal according to the codes available at \cite{z4codes}.</p></details> | 18 |

| **[A New Construction Structure on Coded Caching with Linear Subpacketization: Non-Half-Sum Disjoint Packing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11855v3)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coded caching is a promising technique to effectively reduce peak traffic by using local caches and the multicast gains generated by these local caches. We prefer to design a coded caching scheme with the subpacketization $F$ and transmission load $R$ as small as possible since these are the key metrics for evaluating the implementation complexity and transmission efficiency of the scheme, respectively. However, most of the existing coded caching schemes have large subpacketizations which grow exponentially with the number of users $K$, and there are a few schemes with linear subpacketizations which have large transmission loads. In this paper, we focus on studying the linear subpacketization, i.e., $K=F$, coded caching scheme with low transmission load. Specifically, we first introduce a new combinatorial structure called non-half-sum disjoint packing (NHSDP) which can be used to generate a coded caching scheme with $K=F$. Then a class of new schemes is obtained by constructing NHSDP. Theoretical and numerical comparisons show that (i) compared to the existing schemes with linear subpacketization (to the number of users), the proposed scheme achieves a lower load; (ii) compared to some existing schemes with polynomial subpacketization, the proposed scheme can also achieve a lower load in some cases; (iii) compared to some existing schemes with exponential subpacketization, the proposed scheme has loads close to those of these schemes in some cases. Moreover, the new concept of NHSDP is closely related to the classical combinatorial structures such as cyclic difference packing (CDP), non-three-term arithmetic progressions (NTAP), and perfect hash family (PHF). These connections indicate that NHSDP is an important combinatorial structure in the field of combinatorial design.</p></details> |  |

However, it still encounters various challenging obstacles that need to be solved before real-world deployment. The major challenge is the lack of standardization across different directions, leading to variations in interpretations and objectives. In the survey, we provide detailed explanations of three leading directions in semantic communications, namely Theory of Mind, Generative AI, Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding. These directions have been widely studied, developed, and verified by institutes worldwide, and their effectiveness has increased along with the advancement in technology. We first introduce the concepts and background of these directions. Firstly, we introduce the Theory of Mind, where the communication agents interact with each other, gaining understanding from observations and slowly forming a common language. Secondly, we present generative AI models, which can create new content and offer more freedom to interpret the data beyond the limitation of semantic meaning compression of raw data before transmitting it. The received signal is then decoded by another generative AI model to execute the oriented task. Thirdly, we review deep learning models to jointly optimize the source and channel coding modules. Then, we present a comprehensive survey of existing works in each direction, thereby offering readers an overview of past achievements and potential avenues for further contribution. Moreover, for each direction, we identify and discuss the existing challenges that must be addressed before these approaches can be effectively deployed in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a new Mixed-Integer Conic Program (MICP) formulation for the Multi-Agent Moving-Target Traveling Salesman Problem (MA-MT-TSP), a generalization of the MT-TSP involving multiple agents. Our approach begins by restating the current state-of-the-art MICP formulation for MA-MT-TSP as a Nonconvex Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP), followed by a novel reformulation into a new MICP. We present computational results demonstrating that our formulation outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving up to two orders of magnitude reduction in runtime, and over 90% improvement in optimality gap.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

To assist humans in repairing them, we propose to automatically decompose complex solutions into multiple simpler pieces that correspond to specific subtasks. We introduce a novel objective for learning task decomposition, termed assistive value (AssistV), which measures the feasibility and speed for humans to repair the decomposed solution. We collect a dataset of human repair experiences on different decomposed solutions. Utilizing the collected data as in-context examples, we then learn to critique, refine, and rank decomposed solutions to improve AssistV. We validate our method under competitive programming problems: under 177 hours of human study, our method enables non-experts to solve 33.3\% more problems, speeds them up by 3.3x, and empowers them to match unassisted experts.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2024 Main Conference</p></details> |

Unlike traditional approaches for program realization that assume full agent control or rely on incremental search, we address scenarios where environmental nondeterminism significantly influences program outcomes. Our synthesis problem involves deriving a policy that successfully realizes a given Golog program while ensuring the satisfaction of a temporal specification, expressed in Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf), across all possible environmental behaviors. By leveraging an expressive class of first-order action theories, we construct a finite game arena that encapsulates program executions and tracks the satisfaction of the temporal goal. A game-theoretic approach is employed to derive such a policy. Experimental results demonstrate this approach's feasibility in domains with unbounded objects and non-local effects. This work bridges agent programming and temporal logic synthesis, providing a framework for robust agent behavior in nondeterministic environments.</p></details> | AAAI'25 |
| **[How Consistent Are Humans When Grading Programming Assignments?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12967v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Providing consistent summative assessment to students is important, as the grades they are awarded affect their progression through university and future career prospects. While small cohorts are typically assessed by a single assessor, such as the class leader, larger cohorts are often assessed by multiple assessors, which increases the risk of inconsistent grading. To investigate the consistency of human grading of programming assignments, we asked 28 participants to each grade 40 CS1 introductory Java assignments, providing grades and feedback for correctness, code elegance, readability and documentation; the 40 assignments were split into two batches of 20. In the second batch of 20, we duplicated one assignment from the first to analyse the internal consistency of individual assessors. We measured the inter-rater reliability of the groups using Krippendorf's $\alpha$ -- an $\alpha > 0.667$ is recommended to make tentative conclusions based on the rating. Our groups were inconsistent, with an average $\alpha = 0.2$ when grading correctness and an average $\alpha < 0.1$ for code elegance, readability and documentation. To measure the individual consistency of graders, we measured the distance between the grades they awarded for the duplicated assignment in batch one and batch two. Only one participant of the 22 who didn't notice that the assignment was a duplicate was awarded the same grade for correctness, code elegance, readability and documentation. The average grade difference was 1.79 for correctness and less than 1.6 for code elegance, readability and documentation. Our results show that human graders in our study can not agree on the grade to give a piece of student work and are often individually inconsistent, suggesting that the idea of a ``gold standard'' of human grading might be flawed, and highlights that a shared rubric alone is not enough to ensure consistency.</p></details> |  |

This work explores the design and implementation of proactive AI assistants powered by large language models. We first outline the key design considerations for building effective proactive assistants. As a case study, we propose a proactive chat-based programming assistant that automatically provides suggestions and facilitates their integration into the programmer's code. The programming context provides a shared workspace enabling the assistant to offer more relevant suggestions. We conducted a randomized experimental study examining the impact of various design elements of the proactive assistant on programmer productivity and user experience. Our findings reveal significant benefits of incorporating proactive chat assistants into coding environments and uncover important nuances that influence their usage and effectiveness.</p></details> | CHI 2025 |

In this work, we extend the offloading capability to quantum computers. We explain the necessary changes to the Clang compiler and the Nanos6 runtime, which are both part of OmpSs-2. In addition, we develop a simulator that simulates a quantum computer in the network and receives the jobs offloaded by the runtime. Four detailed examples show how our programming model can be used to write hybrid quantum-classical software. The examples are random number generation, a parameter scan using the mean-field ansatz, a variational algorithm using this ansatz, and handwritten digit recognition using a hybrid convolutional neural network.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models in Competitive Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20868v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o3 and DeepSeek-R1 emerging, large language models (LLMs) have entered a new phase of development. However, existing benchmarks for coding evaluation are gradually inadequate to assess the capability of advanced LLMs in code reasoning. To bridge the gap for high-level code reasoning assessment, we propose ProBench to benchmark LLMs in competitive programming, drawing inspiration from the International Collegiate Programming Contest. ProBench collects a comprehensive set of competitive programming problems from Codeforces, Luogu, and Nowcoder platforms during the period from July to December 2024, obtaining real test results through online submissions to ensure the fairness and accuracy of the evaluation. We establish a unified problem attribute system, including difficulty grading and algorithm tagging. With carefully collected and annotated data in ProBench, we systematically assess 9 latest LLMs in competitive programming across multiple dimensions, including thought chain analysis, error type diagnosis, and reasoning depth evaluation. Experimental results show that QwQ-32B-Preview achieves the best score of 20.93 followed by DeepSeek-V3 with a score of 16.38, suggesting that models trained with specialized reasoning tasks significantly outperform general-purpose models (even larger than reasoning-oriented models) in programming. Further analysis also reveals key areas for programming capability enhancement, e.g., algorithm adaptability and reasoning sufficiency, providing important insights for the future development of reasoning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing the Design Space: Parallel Versions for Exploratory Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20535v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploratory programming involves open-ended tasks. To evaluate their progress on these, programmers require frequent feedback and means to tell if the feedback they observe is bringing them in the right direction. Collecting, comparing, and sharing feedback is typically done through ad-hoc means: relying on memory to compare outputs, code comments, or manual screenshots. To approach this issue, we designed Exploriants: an extension to example-based live programming. Exploriants allows programmers to place variation points. It collects outputs captured in probes and presents them in a comparison view that programmers can customize to suit their program domain. We find that the addition of variation points and the comparisons view encourages a structured approach to exploring variations of a program. We demonstrate Exploriants' capabilities and applicability in three case studies on image processing, data processing, and game development. Given Exploriants, exploratory programmers are given a straightforward means to evaluate their progress and do not have to rely on ad-hoc methods that may introduce errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistent Distributed Reactive Programming with Retroactive Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20534v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Many systems require receiving data from multiple information sources, which act as distributed network devices that asynchronously send the latest data at their own pace to generalize various kinds of devices and connections, known as the Internet of Things (IoT). These systems often perform computations both **reactively** and **retroactively** on information received from the sources for monitoring and analytical purposes, respectively. Inquiry: It is challenging to design a programming language that can describe such systems at a high level of abstraction for two reasons: (1) reactive and retroactive computations in these systems are performed alongside the execution of other application logic; and (2) information sources may be distributed, and data from these sources may arrive late or be lost entirely. Addressing these difficulties is our fundamental problem. Approach: We propose a programming language that supports the following features. First, our language incorporates reactive time-varying values (also known as signals) embedded within an imperative language. Second, it supports multiple information sources that are distributed and represented as signals, meaning they can be declaratively composed to form other time-varying values. Finally, it allows computation over past values collected from information sources and recovery from inconsistency caused by packet loss. To address the aforementioned difficulties, we develop a core calculus for this proposed language. Knowledge: This calculus is a hybrid of reactive/retroactive computations and imperative ones. Because of this hybrid nature, the calculus is inherently complex; however, we have simplified it as much as possible. First, its semantics are modeled as a simple, single-threaded abstraction based on typeless object calculus. Meanwhile, reactive computations that execute in parallel are modeled using a simple process calculus and are integrated with the object calculus, ensuring that the computation results are always serialized. Specifically, we show that time consistency is guaranteed in the calculus; in other words, consistency can be recovered at any checkpoint. Grounding: This work is supported by formally stating and proving theorems regarding time consistency. We also conducted a microbenchmarking experiment to demonstrate that the implemented recovery process is feasible in our assumed application scenarios. Importance: The ensured time consistency provides a rigorous foundation for performing analytics on computation results obtained from distributed information sources, even when these sources experience delays or packet loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Program Slices Change How Developers Diagnose Gradual Run-Time Type Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20533v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A gradual type system allows developers to declare certain types to be enforced by the compiler (i.e., statically typed), while leaving other types to be enforced via runtime checks (i.e., dynamically typed). When runtime checks fail, debugging gradually typed programs becomes cumbersome, because these failures may arise far from the original point where an inconsistent type assumption is made. To ease this burden on developers, some gradually typed languages produce a blame report for a given type inconsistency. However, these reports are sometimes misleading, because they might point to program points that do not need to be changed to stop the error. To overcome the limitations of blame reports, we propose using dynamic program slicing as an alternative approach to help programmers debug run-time type errors. We describe a proof-of-concept for TypeSlicer, a tool that would present dynamic program slices to developers when a runtime check fails. We performed a Wizard-of-Oz user study to investigate how developers respond to dynamic program slices through a set of simulated interactions with TypeScript programs. This formative study shows that developers can understand and apply dynamic slice information to provide change recommendations when debugging runtime type errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Supervised Fine-Tuning LLMs to Behave as Pedagogical Agents in Programming Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20527v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored in higher education, yet their effectiveness as teaching agents remains underexamined. In this paper, we present the development of GuideLM, a fine-tuned LLM designed for programming education. GuideLM has been integrated into the Debugging C Compiler (DCC), an educational C compiler that leverages LLMs to generate pedagogically sound error explanations. Previously, DCC relied on off-the-shelf OpenAI models, which, while accurate, often over-assisted students by directly providing solutions despite contrary prompting. To address this, we employed supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a dataset of 528 student-question/teacher-answer pairs, creating two models: GuideLM and GuideLM-mini, fine-tuned on ChatGPT-4o and 4o-mini, respectively. We conducted an expert analysis of 400 responses per model, comparing their pedagogical effectiveness against base OpenAI models. Our evaluation, grounded in constructivism and cognitive load theory, assessed factors such as conceptual scaffolding, clarity, and Socratic guidance. Results indicate that GuideLM and GuideLM-mini improve pedagogical performance, with an 8% increase in Socratic guidance and a 58% improvement in economy of words compared to GPT-4o. However, this refinement comes at the cost of a slight reduction in general accuracy. While further work is needed, our findings suggest that fine-tuning LLMs with targeted datasets is a promising approach for developing models better suited to educational contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two Approaches for Programming Education in the Domain of Graphics: An Experiment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20526v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Graphics is a popular domain for teaching introductory programming in a motivating way, even in text-based programming languages. Over the last few decades, a large number of libraries using different approaches have been developed for this purpose. Inquiry: Prior work in introductory programming that uses graphics as input and output has shown positive results in terms of engagement, but research is scarce on whether learners are able to use programming concepts learned through graphics for programming in other domains, transferring what they have learned. Approach: We conducted a randomized, controlled experiment with 145 students as participants divided into two groups. Both groups programmed using graphics in Python, but used different approaches: one group used a compositional graphics library named PyTamaro; the other used the Turtle graphics library from Python's standard library. Student engagement was assessed with surveys, and programming knowledge with a post-test on general programming concepts and programming tasks in the domain of graphics. Knowledge: We find few differences between the two groups on the post-test, despite the PyTamaro group having practiced on problems isomorphic to those in the post-test. The participants traced a compositional graphics program more accurately than a 'comparable' turtle graphics program. Both groups report high engagement and perceived learning; both perform well on simple program-writing tasks to create graphics. Grounding: Our findings are based on a controlled experiment with a count of 145 participants, which exceeds the sample size indicated by power analysis to detect a medium effect size. The complete instrument and teaching materials used in the study are available as appendixes. Importance: This study adds further evidence that graphics is an engaging domain for introductory programming; moreover, it shows that the compositional graphics approach adopted by PyTamaro yields engagement levels comparable to the venerable turtle approach. Compositional graphics code appears to be easier to trace than turtle graphics code. As for conceptual knowledge, our results indicate that practicing on programming tasks isomorphic to those of the test can still not be enough to achieve better transfer. This challenges programming educators and researchers to investigate further which graphics-based approaches work best and how to facilitate transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Programming Really Is Simple Mathematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17149v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A re-construction of the fundamentals of programming as a small mathematical theory (PRISM) based on elementary set theory. Highlights: $\bullet$ Zero axioms. No properties are assumed, all are proved (from standard set theory). $\bullet$ A single concept covers specifications and programs. $\bullet$ Its definition only involves one relation and one set. $\bullet$ Everything proceeds from three operations: choice, composition and restriction. $\bullet$ These techniques suffice to derive the axioms of classic papers on the "laws of programming" as consequences and prove them mechanically. $\bullet$ The ordinary subset operator suffices to define both the notion of program correctness and the concepts of specialization and refinement. $\bullet$ From this basis, the theory deduces dozens of theorems characterizing important properties of programs and programming. $\bullet$ All these theorems have been mechanically verified (using Isabelle/HOL); the proofs are available in a public repository. This paper is a considerable extension and rewrite of an earlier contribution [arXiv:1507.00723]</p></details> |  |
| **[LangProBe: a Language Programs Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20315v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composing language models (LMs) into multi-step language programs and automatically optimizing their modular prompts is now a mainstream paradigm for building AI systems, but the tradeoffs in this space have only scarcely been studied before. We introduce LangProBe, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating the architectures and optimization strategies for language programs, with over 2000 combinations of tasks, architectures, optimizers, and choices of LMs. Using LangProBe, we are the first to study the impact of program architectures and optimizers (and their compositions together and with different models) on tradeoffs of quality and cost. We find that optimized language programs offer strong cost--quality Pareto improvement over raw calls to models, but simultaneously demonstrate that human judgment (or empirical decisions) about which compositions to pursue is still necessary for best performance. We will open source the code and evaluation data for LangProBe.</p></details> |  |

Progress towards that goal is hindered by the absence of a common frame of reference for the multiplicity of APR ideas, methods, tools, programming languages and environments. Bugfix is an effort at providing such a framework: a standardized set of notations, tools and interfaces, as well as a database of bugs and fixes, for use by the APR research community to try out ideas and compare results. The most directly visible component of the Bugfix effort is the Bugfix language, a human-readable formalism making it possible to describe elements of the following kinds: a bug (described abstractly, for example the permutation of two arguments in a call); a bug example (an actual occurrence of a bug, in a specific code written in a specific programming language, and usually recorded in some repository); a fix (a particular correction of a bug, obtained for example by reversing the misplaced arguments); an application (an entity that demonstrates how a actual code example matches with a fix); a construct (the abstract description of a programming mechanism, for example a ``while'' loop, independently of its realization in a programming language; and a language (a description of how a particular programming language includes certain constructs and provides specific concrete syntax for each of them -- for example Java includes loop, assignment etc. and has a defined format for each of them). A JSON API provides it in a form accessible to tools. Bugfix includes a repository containing a considerable amount of bugs, examples and fixes. Note: An early step towards this article was a short contribution (Ref [1]) to the 2024 ICSE. The present text reuses a few elements of introduction and motivation but is otherwise thoroughly reworked and extended.</p></details> |  |
| **[Program Synthesis Dialog Agents for Interactive Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19610v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world eligibility problems, ranging from medical diagnosis to tax planning, can be mapped to decision problems expressed in natural language, wherein a model must make a binary choice based on user features. Large-scale domains such as legal codes or frequently updated funding opportunities render human annotation (e.g., web forms or decision trees) impractical, highlighting the need for agents that can automatically assist in decision-making. Since relevant information is often only known to the user, it is crucial that these agents ask the right questions. As agents determine when to terminate a conversation, they face a trade-off between accuracy and the number of questions asked, a key metric for both user experience and cost. To evaluate this task, we propose BeNYfits, a new benchmark for determining user eligibility for multiple overlapping social benefits opportunities through interactive decision-making. Our experiments show that current language models struggle with frequent hallucinations, with GPT-4o scoring only 35.7 F1 using a ReAct-style chain-of-thought. To address this, we introduce ProADA, a novel approach that leverages program synthesis to assist in decision-making by mapping dialog planning to a code generation problem and using gaps in structured data to determine the best next action. Our agent, ProADA, improves the F1 score to 55.6 while maintaining nearly the same number of dialog turns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Language Probabilistic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19538v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are many different probabilistic programming languages that are specialized to specific kinds of probabilistic programs. From a usability and scalability perspective, this is undesirable: today, probabilistic programmers are forced up-front to decide which language they want to use and cannot mix-and-match different languages for handling heterogeneous programs. To rectify this, we seek a foundation for sound interoperability for probabilistic programming languages: just as today's Python programmers can resort to low-level C programming for performance, we argue that probabilistic programmers should be able to freely mix different languages for meeting the demands of heterogeneous probabilistic programming environments. As a first step towards this goal, we introduce \textsc{MultiPPL}, a probabilistic multi-language that enables programmers to interoperate between two different probabilistic programming languages: one that leverages a high-performance exact discrete inference strategy, and one that uses approximate importance sampling. We give a syntax and semantics for \textsc{MultiPPL}, prove soundness of its inference algorithm, and provide empirical evidence that it enables programmers to perform inference on complex heterogeneous probabilistic programs and flexibly exploits the strengths and weaknesses of two languages simultaneously.%</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at OOPSLA 2025 (R1)</p></details> |
| **[Verde: Verification via Refereed Delegation for Machine Learning Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19405v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning programs, such as those performing inference, fine-tuning, and training of LLMs, are commonly delegated to untrusted compute providers. To provide correctness guarantees for the client, we propose adapting the cryptographic notion of refereed delegation to the machine learning setting. This approach enables a computationally limited client to delegate a program to multiple untrusted compute providers, with a guarantee of obtaining the correct result if at least one of them is honest. Refereed delegation of ML programs poses two technical hurdles: (1) an arbitration protocol to resolve disputes when compute providers disagree on the output, and (2) the ability to bitwise reproduce ML programs across different hardware setups, For (1), we design Verde, a dispute arbitration protocol that efficiently handles the large scale and graph-based computational model of modern ML programs. For (2), we build RepOps (Reproducible Operators), a library that eliminates hardware "non-determinism" by controlling the order of floating point operations performed on all hardware. Our implementation shows that refereed delegation achieves both strong guarantees for clients and practical overheads for compute providers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundations for Deductive Verification of Continuous Probabilistic Programs: From Lebesgue to Riemann and Back](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19388v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We lay out novel foundations for the computer-aided verification of guaranteed bounds on expected outcomes of imperative probabilistic programs featuring (i) general loops, (ii) continuous distributions, and (iii) conditioning. To handle loops we rely on user-provided quantitative invariants, as is well established. However, in the realm of continuous distributions, invariant verification becomes extremely challenging due to the presence of integrals in expectation-based program semantics. Our key idea is to soundly under- or over-approximate these integrals via Riemann sums. We show that this approach enables the SMT-based invariant verification for programs with a fairly general control flow structure. On the theoretical side, we prove convergence of our Riemann approximations, and establish coRE-completeness of the central verification problems. On the practical side, we show that our approach enables to use existing automated verifiers targeting discrete probabilistic programs for the verification of programs involving continuous sampling. Towards this end, we implement our approach in the recent quantitative verification infrastructure Caesar by encoding Riemann sums in its intermediate verification language. We present several promising case studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of OOPSLA 25 paper, 55 pages</p></details> |

To achieve increasingly more responsive behaviors upon interactions without relying on centralized computation, embodying memory directly in the machines' structure is crucial. Here, we harness the bistability of elastic shells to alter the fluidic properties of an enclosed cavity, thereby switching between stable frequency states of a locomoting self-oscillating machine. To program these memory states upon interactions, we develop fluidic circuits surrounding the bistable shell, with soft tubes that kink and unkink when externally touched. We implement circuits for both long-term and short-term memory in a soft machine that switches behaviors in response to a human user and that autonomously changes direction after detecting a wall. By harnessing only geometry and elasticity, embodying memory allows physical structures without a central brain to exhibit autonomous feats that are typically reserved for computer-based robotic systems.</p></details> |  |

However, current self-study methods, such as browsing reference solutions or using LLM assistants, often provide excessive or generic assistance that misaligns with learners' decomposition strategies, hindering independent problem-solving and critical thinking. To address this, we introduce Decomposition Box (DBox), an interactive LLM-based system that scaffolds and adapts to learners' personalized construction of a step tree through a "learner-LLM co-decomposition" approach, providing tailored support at an appropriate level. A within-subjects study (N=24) found that compared to the baseline, DBox significantly improved learning gains, cognitive engagement, and critical thinking. Learners also reported a stronger sense of achievement and found the assistance appropriate and helpful for learning. Additionally, we examined DBox's impact on cognitive load, identified usage patterns, and analyzed learners' strategies for managing system errors. We conclude with design implications for future AI-powered tools to better support algorithmic programming education.</p></details> |  |

Exploring and Evaluating the Design and Trade-offs of Proactive AI Programming Support](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18658v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI programming tools enable powerful code generation, and recent prototypes attempt to reduce user effort with proactive AI agents, but their impact on programming workflows remains unexplored. We introduce and evaluate Codellaborator, a design probe LLM agent that initiates programming assistance based on editor activities and task context. We explored three interface variants to assess trade-offs between increasingly salient AI support: prompt-only, proactive agent, and proactive agent with presence and context (Codellaborator). In a within-subject study (N=18), we find that proactive agents increase efficiency compared to prompt-only paradigm, but also incur workflow disruptions. However, presence indicators and \revise{interaction context support} alleviated disruptions and improved users' awareness of AI processes. We underscore trade-offs of Codellaborator on user control, ownership, and code understanding, emphasizing the need to adapt proactivity to programming processes. Our research contributes to the design exploration and evaluation of proactive AI systems, presenting design implications on AI-integrated programming workflow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Better Understanding of Program-of-Thought Reasoning in Cross-Lingual and Multilingual Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17956v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-step reasoning is essential for large language models (LLMs), yet multilingual performance remains challenging. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning, it struggles with non-English languages due to the entanglement of reasoning and execution. Program-of-Thought (PoT) prompting separates reasoning from execution, offering a promising alternative but shifting the challenge to generating programs from non-English questions. We propose a framework to evaluate PoT by separating multilingual reasoning from code execution to examine (i) the impact of fine-tuning on question-reasoning alignment and (ii) how reasoning quality affects answer correctness. Our findings demonstrate that PoT fine-tuning substantially enhances multilingual reasoning, outperforming CoT fine-tuned models. We further demonstrate a strong correlation between reasoning quality (measured through code quality) and answer accuracy, highlighting its potential as a test-time performance improvement heuristic.</p></details> |  |

While that policy is not computable, computable policies do exist in its proximity. We will define AI as a computable policy which is sufficiently proximal to the best performing policy. Before we can define the agent's best performing policy, we need a language for description of the world. We will also use this language to develop a program which satisfies the AI definition. The program will first understand the world by describing it in the selected language. The program will then use the description in order to predict the future and select the best possible move. While this program is extremely inefficient and practically unusable, it can be improved by refining both the language for description of the world and the algorithm used to predict the future. This can yield a program which is both efficient and consistent with the AI definition.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpecGen: Automated Generation of Formal Program Specifications via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08807v5)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal program specifications play a crucial role in various stages of software development. However, manually crafting formal program specifications is rather difficult, making the job time-consuming and labor-intensive. It is even more challenging to write specifications that correctly and comprehensively describe the semantics of complex programs. To reduce the burden on software developers, automated specification generation methods have emerged. However, existing methods usually rely on predefined templates or grammar, making them struggle to accurately describe the behavior and functionality of complex real-world programs. To tackle this challenge, we introduce SpecGen, a novel technique for formal program specification generation based on Large Language Models. Our key insight is to overcome the limitations of existing methods by leveraging the code comprehension capability of LLMs. The process of SpecGen consists of two phases. The first phase employs a conversational approach that guides the LLM to generate appropriate specifications for a given program. The second phase, designed for where the LLM fails to generate correct specifications, applies four mutation operators to the model-generated specifications and selects verifiable specifications from the mutated ones through a novel heuristic selection strategy. We evaluate SpecGen on two datasets, including the SV-COMP Java category benchmark and a manually constructed dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that SpecGen succeeds in generating verifiable specifications for 279 out of 385 programs, outperforming the existing purely LLM-based approaches and conventional specification generation tools like Houdini and Daikon. Further investigations on the quality of generated specifications indicate that SpecGen can comprehensively articulate the behaviors of the input program.</p></details> |  |

Collaborative programming emerges as an effective method for instructors to support novice students in developing coding and teamwork abilities. However, due to limited class time and attention, instructors face challenges in monitoring and evaluating the progress and performance of groups or individuals. To address this issue, we collect multimodal data from real-world settings and develop CPVis, an interactive visual analytics system designed to assess student collaboration dynamically. Specifically, CPVis enables instructors to evaluate both group and individual performance efficiently. CPVis employs a novel flower-based visual encoding to represent performance and provides time-based views to capture the evolution of collaborative behaviors. A within-subject experiment (N=22), comparing CPVis with two baseline systems, reveals that users gain more insights, find the visualization more intuitive, and report increased confidence in their assessments of collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Programming with Pixels: Computer-Use Meets Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18525v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in software engineering (SWE) agents have largely followed a $\textit{tool-based paradigm}$, where agents interact with hand-engineered tool APIs to perform specific tasks. While effective for specialized tasks, these methods fundamentally lack generalization, as they require predefined tools for each task and do not scale across programming languages and domains. We introduce $\texttt{Programming with Pixels}$ (PwP), an agent environment that unifies software development tasks by enabling $\textit{computer-use agents}$-agents that operate directly within an IDE through visual perception, typing, and clicking, rather than relying on predefined tool APIs. To systematically evaluate these agents, we propose $\texttt{PwP-Bench}$, a benchmark that unifies existing SWE benchmarks spanning tasks across multiple programming languages, modalities, and domains under a task-agnostic state and action space. Our experiments demonstrate that general-purpose computer-use agents can approach or even surpass specialized tool-based agents on a variety of SWE tasks without the need for hand-engineered tools. However, our analysis shows that current models suffer from limited visual grounding and fail to exploit many IDE tools that could simplify their tasks. When agents can directly access IDE tools, without visual interaction, they show significant performance improvements, highlighting the untapped potential of leveraging built-in IDE capabilities. Our results establish PwP as a scalable testbed for building and evaluating the next wave of software engineering agents. We release code and data at https://programmingwithpixels.com</p></details> |  |

As large language models that can generate code have become widely available, scientists may increasingly use these models during research software development. We investigate the characteristics of scientists who are early-adopters of code generating models and conduct interviews with scientists at a public, research-focused university. Through interviews and reviews of user interaction logs, we see that scientists often use code generating models as an information retrieval tool for navigating unfamiliar programming languages and libraries. We present findings about their verification strategies and discuss potential vulnerabilities that may emerge from code generation practices unknowingly influencing the parameters of scientific analyses.</p></details> | Accepted to CHI 2025 |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Fine-Tuning With Preference Optimization For Visual Program Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.16529v1)** | 2025-02-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual programming languages (VPLs) allow users to create programs through graphical interfaces, which results in easier accessibility and their widespread usage in various domains. To further enhance this accessibility, recent research has focused on generating VPL code from user instructions using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, by employing prompting-based methods, these studies have shown promising results. Nevertheless, such approaches can be less effective for industrial VPLs such as Ladder Diagram (LD). LD is a pivotal language used in industrial automation processes and involves extensive domain-specific configurations, which are difficult to capture in a single prompt. In this work, we demonstrate that training-based methods outperform prompting-based methods for LD generation accuracy, even with smaller backbone models. Building on these findings, we propose a two-stage training strategy to further enhance VPL generation. First, we employ retrieval-augmented fine-tuning to leverage the repetitive use of subroutines commonly seen in industrial VPLs. Second, we apply direct preference optimization (DPO) to further guide the model toward accurate outputs, using systematically generated preference pairs through graph editing operations. Extensive experiments on real-world LD data demonstrate that our approach improves program-level accuracy by over 10% compared to supervised fine-tuning, which highlights its potential to advance industrial automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor Network Structure Search Using Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02711v2)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor networks provide a powerful framework for compressing multi-dimensional data. The optimal tensor network structure for a given data tensor depends on both the inherent data properties and the specific optimality criteria, making tensor network structure search a crucial research problem. Existing solutions typically involve sampling and validating numerous candidate structures; this is computationally expensive, limiting their practical applications. We address this challenge by formulating tensor network structure search as a program synthesis problem and proposing a highly efficient validation method that is based on constraint solving. Specifically, we design a domain specific language: it builds the correspondence between programs and network structures, and uses a novel idea of output-directed splits to compress the search space without hindering the expressiveness. We then propose a synthesis algorithm that can prioritize promising candidates through constraint solving. % Experimental results show that our approach improves search speed by $10\times$ and achieves compression ratios by $1.5\times$ to $3\times$ better than state-of-the-art. Notably, our approach scales to larger tensors that are out of reach by prior work. Finally, we demonstrate that the discovered topologies generalize to data from the same source, achieving compression ratios up to $ 2.4\times$ better than hierarchical Tuckers while maintaining the runtime around $110$ seconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Stepwise Distillation Learning Strategy for Non-differentiable Visual Programming Frameworks on Visual Reasoning Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09809v3)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Visual Programming (VProg) has emerged as a significant framework for visual reasoning (VR) tasks due to its interpretability and cross-task generality. However, even with invoking powerful pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) as visual sub-modules, the performance of VProg on specific VR tasks is markedly inferior compared to well-trained task-specific networks. Although invoking task-specific models can further enhance the performance of VProg on specific VR tasks, it greatly diminishes the cross-task generalization ability of VProg. Besides, the non-differentiable nature of VProg prevents direct fine-tuning on specific VR tasks for further performance improvement. Attempt to address these issues, we propose SDVP, a Stepwise Distillation learning strategy for non-differentiable VPorg across various VR tasks. Specifically, our SDVP stepwise distills the capabilities of existing, well-trained small task-specific models for decomposed visual sub-tasks in VProg into the much larger VLMs invoked by corresponding visual sub-modules. Besides, distilling the knowledge of little-size task-specific models into pre-trained larger VLMs rather than replacing them helps keep the cross-task abilities of VProgs. Extensive and comprehensive experimental results on different VProg frameworks demonstrate that our SDVP obtains significant performance gains on specific VR benchmarks, i.e., GQA (+2.4\%) and NLVRv2 (+6.2\%) for VisProg and GQA (+6.5\%) and NLVRv2 (+4.0\%) for ViperGPT, and also maintains a promising performance for VProg on unseen and previous VR tasks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Foundation Models for Mixed Integer Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08288v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is essential for modeling complex decision-making problems but faces challenges in computational tractability and requires expert formulation. Current deep learning approaches for MILP focus on specific problem classes and do not generalize to unseen classes. To address this shortcoming, we take a foundation model training approach, where we train a single deep learning model on a diverse set of MILP problems to generalize across problem classes. As existing datasets for MILP lack diversity and volume, we introduce MILP-Evolve, a novel LLM-based evolutionary framework that is capable of generating a large set of diverse MILP classes with an unlimited amount of instances. We study our methodology on three key learning tasks that capture diverse aspects of MILP: (1) integrality gap prediction, (2) learning to branch, and (3) a new task of aligning MILP instances with natural language descriptions. Our empirical results show that models trained on the data generated by MILP-Evolve achieve significant improvements on unseen problems, including MIPLIB benchmarks. Our work highlights the potential of moving towards a foundation model approach for MILP that can generalize to a broad range of MILP applications. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/OptiGuide.</p></details> |  |

This progress sets the stage for Beyond 5G (B5G) networks, which present new complexity and performance requirements challenges. Linear Programming (LP), Integer Linear Programming (ILP), and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models have been widely used to model the optimization of resource allocation problems in networks. This paper reviews 103 studies on resource allocation strategies in 5G and B5G, focusing specifically on optimization problems modelled as LP, ILP, and MILP. The selected studies are categorized based on network architectures, types of resource allocation problems, and specific objective functions and constraints. The review also discusses solution methods for NP-hard ILP and MILP problems by categorizing the solution methods into different categories. Additionally, emerging trends, such as integrating AI and machine learning with optimization models, are explored, suggesting promising future research directions in network optimization. The paper concludes that LP, ILP, and MILP models have been widely adopted across various network architectures, resource types, objective functions, and constraints and remain critical to optimizing next-generation networks.</p></details> |  |

| **[How Do Programming Students Use Generative AI?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10091v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Programming students have a widespread access to powerful Generative AI tools like ChatGPT. While this can help understand the learning material and assist with exercises, educators are voicing more and more concerns about an overreliance on generated outputs and lack of critical thinking skills. It is thus important to understand how students actually use generative AI and what impact this could have on their learning behavior. To this end, we conducted a study including an exploratory experiment with 37 programming students, giving them monitored access to ChatGPT while solving a code authoring exercise. The task was not directly solvable by ChatGPT and required code comprehension and reasoning. While only 23 of the students actually opted to use the chatbot, the majority of those eventually prompted it to simply generate a full solution. We observed two prevalent usage strategies: to seek knowledge about general concepts and to directly generate solutions. Instead of using the bot to comprehend the code and their own mistakes, students often got trapped in a vicious cycle of submitting wrong generated code and then asking the bot for a fix. Those who self-reported using generative AI regularly were more likely to prompt the bot to generate a solution. Our findings indicate that concerns about potential decrease in programmers' agency and productivity with Generative AI are justified. We discuss how researchers and educators can respond to the potential risk of students uncritically over-relying on Generative AI. We also discuss potential modifications to our study design for large-scale replications.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint; accepted to ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE) 2025</p></details> |

However, the expert load imbalance problem always happens in MoE model pre-training, which will cause routing collapse or increased computational overhead. In order to balance loads on experts, we propose BIP-Based Balancing, an expert load balancing algorithm based on binary integer programming (BIP). The algorithm maintains an additional vector q that can help change the top-K order of s by solving a binary integer programming with very small time costs. In simulation experiments, we observe that BIP-Based Balancing make imbalance disappoint very fast, while the final sum of routine scores decreases very little. Our algorithm achieves nearly perfect trade-off between expert load balance and pre-training efficiency under the simulation view.</p></details> |  |

First, by using the duality between the dynamic programming and the semi-definite programming formulations of any q-MDP with open-loop policies, we establish that the optimal value function is linear and there exists a stationary optimal policy among open-loop policies. Then, using these results, we establish a method for computing an approximately optimal value function and formulate computation of optimal stationary open-loop policy as a bi-linear program. Next, we turn our attention to classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies. Dynamic programming and semi-definite programming formulations for classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies are established, where duality of these two formulations similarly enables us to prove that the optimal policy is linear and there exists an optimal stationary classical-state-preserving closed-loop policy. Then, similar to the open-loop case, we establish a method for computing the optimal value function and pose computation of optimal stationary classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies as a bi-linear program.</p></details> | 53 pages |
| **[Computation Tree Logic Guided Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15344v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal logics like Computation Tree Logic (CTL) have been widely used as expressive formalisms to capture rich behavioral specifications. CTL can express properties such as reachability, termination, invariants and responsiveness, which are difficult to test. This paper suggests a mechanism for the automated repair of infinite-state programs guided by CTL properties. Our produced patches avoid the overfitting issue that occurs in test-suite-guided repair, where the repaired code may not pass tests outside the given test suite. To realize this vision, we propose a repair framework based on Datalog, a widely used domain-specific language for program analysis, which readily supports nested fixed-point semantics of CTL via stratified negation. Specifically, our framework encodes the program and CTL properties into Datalog facts and rules and performs the repair by modifying the facts to pass the analysis rules. Previous research proposed a generic repair mechanism for Datalog-based analysis in the form of Symbolic Execution of Datalog (SEDL). However, SEDL only supports positive Datalog, which is insufficient for expressing CTL properties. Thus, we extended SEDL to make it applicable to stratified Datalog. Moreover, liveness property violations involve infinite computations, which we handle via a novel loop summarization. Our approach achieves analysis accuracy of 56.6% on a small-scale benchmark and 88.5% on a real-world benchmark, outperforming the best baseline performances of 27.7% and 76.9%. Our approach repairs all detected bugs, which is not achieved by existing tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe Pareto Improvements for Expected Utility Maximizers in Program Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05103v5)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents in mixed-motive coordination problems such as Chicken may fail to coordinate on a Pareto-efficient outcome. Safe Pareto improvements (SPIs) were originally proposed to mitigate miscoordination in cases where players lack probabilistic beliefs as to how their delegates will play a game; delegates are instructed to behave so as to guarantee a Pareto improvement on how they would play by default. More generally, SPIs may be defined as transformations of strategy profiles such that all players are necessarily better off under the transformed profile. In this work, we investigate the extent to which SPIs can reduce downsides of miscoordination between expected utility-maximizing agents. We consider games in which players submit computer programs that can condition their decisions on each other's code, and use this property to construct SPIs using programs capable of renegotiation. We first show that under mild conditions on players' beliefs, each player always prefers to use renegotiation. Next, we show that under similar assumptions, each player always prefers to be willing to renegotiate at least to the point at which they receive the lowest payoff they can attain in any efficient outcome. Thus subjectively optimal play guarantees players at least these payoffs, without the need for coordination on specific Pareto improvements. Lastly, we prove that renegotiation does not guarantee players any improvements on this bound.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 24th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS-25)</p></details> |
| **[Aligning the Objective of LLM-based Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08877v5)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved decent results on automated program repair (APR). However, the next token prediction training objective of decoder-only LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) is misaligned with the masked span prediction objective of current infilling-style methods, which impedes LLMs from fully leveraging pre-trained knowledge for program repair. In addition, while some LLMs can locate and repair bugs in certain functions using the related artifacts (e.g., test cases), existing methods still depend on statement-level fault localization methods to provide a list of buggy hunks for repair. This restriction hinders LLMs from exploring potential patches beyond the given locations. In this paper, we investigate a new approach to adapt LLMs to program repair. Our core insight is that LLM's APR capability can be greatly improved by simply aligning the output to their training objective and allowing them to refine the whole program without first identifying faulty statements. Based on this insight, we designed D4C, a straightforward prompting framework for APR. D4C can repair 180 bugs correctly in Defects4J, with each patch being sampled only 10 times. This surpasses the SOTA APR methods with perfect fault localization by 10% and reduces the patch sampling number by 90%. Our findings reveal that (1) objective alignment is crucial for fully exploiting LLM's pre-trained capability, and (2) replacing the traditional localize-buggy-hunks-then-repair workflow with direct debugging is more effective for LLM-based APR methods. Thus, we believe this paper introduces a new mindset for harnessing LLMs in APR.</p></details> | Accepted by ICSE'25 |
| **[Towards Secure Program Partitioning for Smart Contracts with LLM's In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14215v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts are highly susceptible to manipulation attacks due to the leakage of sensitive information. Addressing manipulation vulnerabilities is particularly challenging because they stem from inherent data confidentiality issues rather than straightforward implementation bugs. To tackle this by preventing sensitive information leakage, we present PartitionGPT, the first LLM-driven approach that combines static analysis with the in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to partition smart contracts into privileged and normal codebases, guided by a few annotated sensitive data variables. We evaluated PartitionGPT on 18 annotated smart contracts containing 99 sensitive functions. The results demonstrate that PartitionGPT successfully generates compilable, and verified partitions for 78% of the sensitive functions while reducing approximately 30% code compared to function-level partitioning approach. Furthermore, we evaluated PartitionGPT on nine real-world manipulation attacks that lead to a total loss of 25 million dollars, PartitionGPT effectively prevents eight cases, highlighting its potential for broad applicability and the necessity for secure program partitioning during smart contract development to diminish manipulation vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autellix: An Efficient Serving Engine for LLM Agents as General Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13965v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) applications are evolving beyond simple chatbots into dynamic, general-purpose agentic programs, which scale LLM calls and output tokens to help AI agents reason, explore, and solve complex tasks. However, existing LLM serving systems ignore dependencies between programs and calls, missing significant opportunities for optimization. Our analysis reveals that programs submitted to LLM serving engines experience long cumulative wait times, primarily due to head-of-line blocking at both the individual LLM request and the program. To address this, we introduce Autellix, an LLM serving system that treats programs as first-class citizens to minimize their end-to-end latencies. Autellix intercepts LLM calls submitted by programs, enriching schedulers with program-level context. We propose two scheduling algorithms-for single-threaded and distributed programs-that preempt and prioritize LLM calls based on their programs' previously completed calls. Our evaluation demonstrates that across diverse LLMs and agentic workloads, Autellix improves throughput of programs by 4-15x at the same latency compared to state-of-the-art systems, such as vLLM.</p></details> |  |

This work seeks to understand the reason for this adherence, considering the gender issue in Programming Marathons over the last years, in a real context. This work aims to understand the context of female representativeness in which the intellectual aspects do not differ in gender. Still, there is a considerable discrepancy in female belonging.</p></details> | 9 pages |

We argue that successfully deploying AI software engineers requires a level of trust equal to or even greater than the trust established by human-driven software engineering practices. The recent trend toward LLM agents offers a path toward integrating the power of LLMs to create new code with the power of analysis tools to increase trust in the code. This opinion piece comments on whether LLM agents could dominate software engineering workflows in the future and whether the focus of programming will shift from programming at scale to programming with trust.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[AutoTEE: Automated Migration and Protection of Programs in Trusted Execution Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13379v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) isolate a special space within a device's memory that is not accessible to the normal world (also known as Untrusted Environment), even when the device is compromised. Thus, developers can utilize TEEs to provide strong security guarantees for their programs, making sensitive operations like encrypted data storage, fingerprint verification, and remote attestation protected from malicious attacks. Despite the strong protections offered by TEEs, adapting existing programs to leverage such security guarantees is non-trivial, often requiring extensive domain knowledge and manual intervention, which makes TEEs less accessible to developers. This motivates us to design AutoTEE, the first Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled approach that can automatically identify, partition, transform, and port sensitive functions into TEEs with minimal developer intervention. By manually reviewing 68 repositories, we constructed a benchmark dataset consisting of 385 sensitive functions eligible for transformation, on which AutoTEE achieves a high F1 score of 0.91. AutoTEE effectively transforms these sensitive functions into their TEE-compatible counterparts, achieving success rates of 90\% and 83\% for Java and Python, respectively. We further provide a mechanism to automatically port the transformed code to different TEE platforms, including Intel SGX and AMD SEV, demonstrating that the transformed programs run successfully and correctly on these platforms.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Template-Based Visual Program Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08564v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For users with limited computational resources, visual programming or prompting large language models (LLMs) to generate executable code for visual tasks, like visual question answering (VQA), remains largely inaccessible. Even with techniques such as distillation, adapting visual programming to smaller models or specific datasets is still quite challenging due to high annotation costs. We propose a low-cost visual program distillation method that can be used for models with fewer than 1 billion parameters and requires no human-generated program annotations. We achieve this through synthetic data augmentation based on decoupling programs into higher-level skills, called templates, and their corresponding arguments. Experimental results show that, with a relatively small amount of question/answer data, small language models can generate high-quality visual programs with the added benefit of much faster inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Competitive Programming with Large Reasoning Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.06807v2)** | 2025-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that reinforcement learning applied to large language models (LLMs) significantly boosts performance on complex coding and reasoning tasks. Additionally, we compare two general-purpose reasoning models - OpenAI o1 and an early checkpoint of o3 - with a domain-specific system, o1-ioi, which uses hand-engineered inference strategies designed for competing in the 2024 International Olympiad in Informatics (IOI). We competed live at IOI 2024 with o1-ioi and, using hand-crafted test-time strategies, placed in the 49th percentile. Under relaxed competition constraints, o1-ioi achieved a gold medal. However, when evaluating later models such as o3, we find that o3 achieves gold without hand-crafted domain-specific strategies or relaxed constraints. Our findings show that although specialized pipelines such as o1-ioi yield solid improvements, the scaled-up, general-purpose o3 model surpasses those results without relying on hand-crafted inference heuristics. Notably, o3 achieves a gold medal at the 2024 IOI and obtains a Codeforces rating on par with elite human competitors. Overall, these results indicate that scaling general-purpose reinforcement learning, rather than relying on domain-specific techniques, offers a robust path toward state-of-the-art AI in reasoning domains, such as competitive programming.</p></details> |  |

Our approach enables in-situ data recording, visualization, and fine-tuning of skill demonstrations directly within the user's physical environment. RAMPA addresses critical challenges of PbD, such as safety concerns, programming barriers, and the inefficiency of collecting demonstrations on the actual hardware. The performance of our system is evaluated against the traditional method of kinesthetic control in teaching three different robotic manipulation tasks and analyzed with quantitative metrics, measuring task performance and completion time, trajectory smoothness, system usability, user experience, and task load using standardized surveys.

However, the validity and quality of these generated codes need to be systematically evaluated before they can be widely adopted. Despite their growing prominence, a comprehensive evaluation of statistical code generated by LLMs remains scarce in the literature. In this paper, we assess the performance of LLMs, including two versions of ChatGPT and one version of Llama, in the domain of SAS programming for statistical analysis. Our study utilizes a set of statistical analysis tasks encompassing diverse statistical topics and datasets. Each task includes a problem description, dataset information, and human-verified SAS code. We conduct a comprehensive assessment of the quality of SAS code generated by LLMs through human expert evaluation based on correctness, effectiveness, readability, executability, and the accuracy of output results. The analysis of rating scores reveals that while LLMs demonstrate usefulness in generating syntactically correct code, they struggle with tasks requiring deep domain understanding and may produce redundant or incorrect results. This study offers valuable insights into the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in statistical programming, providing guidance for future advancements in AI-assisted coding systems for statistical analysis.</p></details> | 27 pages, 8 figures |

We apply the Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming (StoSQP) method to solve these problems, which can be regarded as applying second-order Newton's method to the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. In each iteration, the StoSQP method computes the Newton direction by solving a quadratic program, and then selects a proper adaptive stepsize $\bar{\alpha}_t$ to update the primal-dual iterate. To reduce dominant computational cost of the method, we inexactly solve the quadratic program in each iteration by employing an iterative sketching solver. Notably, the approximation error of the sketching solver need not vanish as iterations proceed, meaning that the per-iteration computational cost does not blow up. For the above StoSQP method, we show that under mild assumptions, the rescaled primal-dual sequence $1/\sqrt{\bar{\alpha}_t}\cdot (x_t - x^\star, \lambda_t - \lambda^\star)$ converges to a mean-zero Gaussian distribution with a nontrivial covariance matrix depending on the underlying sketching distribution. To perform inference in practice, we also analyze a plug-in covariance matrix estimator. We illustrate the asymptotic normality result of the method both on benchmark nonlinear problems in CUTEst test set and on linearly/nonlinearly constrained regression problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>72 pa...</summary><p>72 pages, 2 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Inferring Accumulative Effects of Higher Order Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02791v2)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many temporal safety properties of higher-order programs go beyond simple event sequencing and require an automaton register (or "accumulator") to express, such as input-dependency, event summation, resource usage, ensuring equal event magnitude, computation cost, etc. Some steps have been made towards verifying more basic temporal event sequences via reductions to fair termination [Murase et al. 2016] or some input-dependent properties through deductive proof systems [Nanjo et al. 2018]. However, there are currently no automated techniques to verify the more general class of register-automaton safety properties of higher-order programs. We introduce an abstract interpretation-based analysis to compute dependent, register-automata effects of recursive, higher-order programs. We capture properties of a program's effects in terms of automata that summarizes the history of observed effects using an accumulator register. The key novelty is a new abstract domain for context-dependent effects, capable of abstracting relations between the program environment, the automaton control state, and the accumulator value. The upshot is a dataflow type and effect system that computes context-sensitive effect summaries. We demonstrate our work via a prototype implementation that computes dependent effect summaries (and validates assertions) for OCaml-like recursive higher order programs. As a basis of comparison, we describe reductions to assertion checking for effect-free programs, and demonstrate that our approach outperforms prior tools Drift and RCaml/PCSat. Overall, across a set of 21 new benchmarks, RCaml/PCSat could not verify any, Drift verified 9 benchmarks, and evDrift verified 19; evDrift also had a 30.5x over Drift on those benchmarks that both tools could solve.</p></details> |  |

Based on the duality principle, we first show that the feasibility of a QP can be determined by the solution of a properly-defined Linear Program (LP). Our analysis yields a LP that can be solved more efficiently compared to the original QP problem, and more importantly, is simpler in form and can be solved more efficiently compared to existing methods that assess feasibility via LPs. The computational efficiency of the proposed method compared to existing methods for feasibility evaluation is demonstrated in comparative case studies as well as a feasible-constraint selection problem, indicating its promise for online feasibility evaluation of optimization-based controllers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Matrix Low-dimensional Qubit Casting Based Quantum Electromagnetic Transient Network Simulation Program](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11728v1)** | 2025-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern power systems, the integration of converter-interfaced generations requires the development of electromagnetic transient network simulation programs (EMTP) that can capture rapid fluctuations. However, as the power system scales, the EMTP's computing complexity increases exponentially, leading to a curse of dimensionality that hinders its practical application. Facing this challenge, quantum computing offers a promising approach for achieving exponential acceleration. To realize this in noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, the variational quantum linear solution (VQLS) was advocated because of its robustness against depolarizing noise. However, it suffers data inflation issues in its preprocessing phase, and no prior research has applied quantum computing to high-frequency switching EMT networks.To address these issues, this paper first designs the matrix low-dimension qubit casting (MLQC) method to address the data inflation problem in the preprocessing of the admittance matrix for VQLS in EMT networks. Besides, we propose a real-only quantum circuit reduction method tailored to the characteristics of the EMT network admittance matrices. Finally, the proposed quantum EMTP algorithm (QEMTP) has been successfully verified for EMT networks containing a large number of high-frequency switching elements.</p></details> |  |

CFP is an intuitionistic first-order logic with inductive and coinductive definitions extended by two propositional operators: Rrestriction, a strengthening of implication, and an operator for total concurrency. The source of the extraction are formal CFP proofs, the target is a lambda calculus with constructors and recursion extended by a constructor Amb (for McCarthy's amb) which is interpreted operationally as globally angelic choice and is used to implement nondeterminism and concurrency. The correctness of extracted programs is proven via an intermediate domain-theoretic denotational semantics. We demonstrate the usefulness of our system by extracting a nondeterministic program that translates infinite Gray code into the signed digit representation. A noteworthy feature of CFP is the fact that the proof rules for restriction and concurrency involve variants of the classical law of excluded middle that would not be interpretable computationally without Amb.This is a revised and extended version of the conference paper with the same title that contains full proofs of all major results.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages + 4 pages appendix. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2104.14669</p></details> |

This paper presents a program logic to under-approximate worst-case resource usage, adapting incorrectness logic (IL) to reason quantitatively about resource consumption. We propose quantitative forward and backward under-approximate (QFUA and QBUA) triples, which generalize IL to identify execution paths leading to high resource usage. We also introduce a variant of QBUA that supports reasoning about high-water marks. Our logic is proven sound and complete with respect to a simple IMP-like language, and we demonstrate its utility through case studies involving arrays, pointers, and procedure calls.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoCoEvo: Co-Evolution of Programs and Test Cases to Enhance Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10802v1)** | 2025-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown remarkable performance in automated code generation. However, existing approaches often rely heavily on pre-defined test cases, which become impractical in scenarios where such cases are unavailable. While prior works explore filtering techniques between programs and test cases, they overlook the refinement of test cases. To address this limitation, we introduce CoCoEvo, a novel LLM-based co-evolution framework that simultaneously evolves programs and test cases. CoCoEvo eliminates the dependency on pre-defined test cases by generating both programs and test cases directly from natural language problem descriptions and function headers. The framework employs specialized evolutionary operators, including LLM-based crossover and mutation operators for program evolution, along with a test case generation operator for test case evolution. Additionally, we propose optimization strategies such as a crossover rate scheduler to balance exploration and convergence, and a multi-objective optimization method for test case selection. Experimental results on multiple state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrate that CoCoEvo surpasses existing methods, achieving state-of-the-art performance in automated code generation and testing. These results underscore the potential of co-evolutionary techniques in advancing the field of automated programming.</p></details> |  |

However, plan-focused pedagogies are rarely used beyond introductory programming. Our formative study (N=10 educators) showed that identifying plans is a tedious process. To advance plan-focused pedagogies in application-focused domains, we created an LLM-powered pipeline that automates the effortful parts of educators' plan identification process by providing use-case-driven program examples and candidate plans. In design workshops (N=7 educators), we identified design goals to maximize instructors' efficiency in plan identification by optimizing interaction with this LLM-generated content. Our resulting tool, PLAID, enables instructors to access a corpus of relevant programs to inspire plan identification, compare code snippets to assist plan refinement, and facilitates them in structuring code snippets into plans. We evaluated PLAID in a within-subjects user study (N=12 educators) and found that PLAID led to lower cognitive demand and increased productivity compared to the state-of-the-art. Educators found PLAID beneficial for generating instructional material. Thus, our findings suggest that human-in-the-loop approaches hold promise for supporting plan-focused pedagogies at scale.</p></details> | 21 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Programming Every Example: Lifting Pre-training Data Quality Like Experts at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.17115v2)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model pre-training has traditionally relied on human experts to craft heuristics for improving the corpora quality, resulting in numerous rules developed to date. However, these rules lack the flexibility to address the unique characteristics of individual example effectively. Meanwhile, applying tailored rules to every example is impractical for human experts. In this paper, we demonstrate that even small language models, with as few as 0.3B parameters, can exhibit substantial data refining capabilities comparable to those of human experts. We introduce Programming Every Example (ProX), a novel framework that treats data refinement as a programming task, enabling models to refine corpora by generating and executing fine-grained operations, such as string normalization, for each individual example at scale. Experimental results show that models pre-trained on ProX-curated data outperform either original data or data filtered by other selection methods by more than 2% across various downstream benchmarks. Its effectiveness spans various model sizes and pre-training corpora, including C4, RedPajama-V2, FineWeb, FineWeb-Edu, and DCLM. Furthermore, ProX exhibits significant potential in domain-specific continual pre-training: without domain specific design, models trained on OpenWebMath refined by ProX outperform human-crafted rule-based methods, improving average accuracy by 7.6% over Mistral-7B, with 14.6% for Llama-2-7B and 20.3% for CodeLlama-7B, all within 10B tokens to be comparable to models like Llemma-7B trained on 200B tokens. Further analysis highlights that ProX significantly saves training FLOPs, offering a promising path for efficient LLM pre-training. We are open-sourcing ProX with >500B corpus, models, and sharing all training and implementation details for reproducible research and future innovation.

The presence of probabilistic behaviour entailed by quantum measurements and unbounded while loops complicate the verification task greatly. We propose a new quantum Hoare logic for local reasoning about probabilistic behaviour by introducing distribution formulas to specify probabilistic properties. We show that the proof rules in the logic are sound with respect to a denotational semantics. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the logic, we formally verify the correctness of non-trivial quantum algorithms including the HHL and Shor's algorithms. Moreover, we embed our logic into the proof assistant Coq. The resulting logical framework, called CoqQLR, can facilitate semi-automated reasoning about classical--quantum programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2107.00804</p></details> |
| **[OMNI-EPIC: Open-endedness via Models of human Notions of Interestingness with Environments Programmed in Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.15568v3)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Open-ended and AI-generating algorithms aim to continuously generate and solve increasingly complex tasks indefinitely, offering a promising path toward more general intelligence. To accomplish this grand vision, learning must occur within a vast array of potential tasks. Existing approaches to automatically generating environments are constrained within manually predefined, often narrow distributions of environment, limiting their ability to create any learning environment. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel framework, OMNI-EPIC, that augments previous work in Open-endedness via Models of human Notions of Interestingness (OMNI) with Environments Programmed in Code (EPIC). OMNI-EPIC leverages foundation models to autonomously generate code specifying the next learnable (i.e., not too easy or difficult for the agent's current skill set) and interesting (e.g., worthwhile and novel) tasks. OMNI-EPIC generates both environments (e.g., an obstacle course) and reward functions (e.g., progress through the obstacle course quickly without touching red objects), enabling it, in principle, to create any simulatable learning task. We showcase the explosive creativity of OMNI-EPIC, which continuously innovates to suggest new, interesting learning challenges. We also highlight how OMNI-EPIC can adapt to reinforcement learning agents' learning progress, generating tasks that are of suitable difficulty. Overall, OMNI-EPIC can endlessly create learnable and interesting environments, further propelling the development of self-improving AI systems and AI-Generating Algorithms.

| **[Statistical data analysis for Tourism in Poland in R Programming Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10100v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study utilises the R programming language for statistical data analysis to understand Tourism dynamics in Poland. It focuses on methods for data visualisation, multivariate statistics, and hypothesis testing. To investigate the expenditure behavior of tourist, spending patterns, correlations, and associations among variables were analysed in the dataset. The results revealed a significant relationship between accommodation type and the purpose of trip, showing that the purpose of a trip impacts the selection of accommodation. A strong correlation was observed between organizer expenditure and private expenditure, indicating that individual spending are more when the spending on organizing the trip are higher. However, no significant difference was observed in total expenditure across different accommodation types and purpose of the trip revealing that travelers tend to spend similar amounts regardless of their reason for travel or choice of accommodation. Although significant relationships were observed among certain variables, ANOVA could not be applied because the dataset was not able to hold on the normality assumption. In future, the dataset can be explored further to find more meaningful insights. The developed code is available on GitHub: https://github.com/SaadAhmedJamal/DataAnalysis RProgEnv.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[DiSciPLE: Learning Interpretable Programs for Scientific Visual Discovery](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10060v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Visual data is used in numerous different scientific workflows ranging from remote sensing to ecology. As the amount of observation data increases, the challenge is not just to make accurate predictions but also to understand the underlying mechanisms for those predictions. Good interpretation is important in scientific workflows, as it allows for better decision-making by providing insights into the data. This paper introduces an automatic way of obtaining such interpretable-by-design models, by learning programs that interleave neural networks. We propose DiSciPLE (Discovering Scientific Programs using LLMs and Evolution) an evolutionary algorithm that leverages common sense and prior knowledge of large language models (LLMs) to create Python programs explaining visual data. Additionally, we propose two improvements: a program critic and a program simplifier to improve our method further to synthesize good programs. On three different real-world problems, DiSciPLE learns state-of-the-art programs on novel tasks with no prior literature. For example, we can learn programs with 35% lower error than the closest non-interpretable baseline for population density estimation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Typed Lambda-Calculus for Establishing Trust in Probabilistic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.00958v3)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The extensive deployment of probabilistic algorithms has radically changed our perspective on several well-established computational notions. Correctness is probably the most basic one. While a typical probabilistic program cannot be said to compute the correct result, we often have quite strong expectations about the frequency with which it should return certain outputs. In these cases, trust as a generalisation of correctness fares better. One way to understand it is to say that a probabilistic computational process is trustworthy if the frequency of its outputs is compliant with a probability distribution which models its expected behaviour. We present a formal computational framework that formalises this idea. In order to do so, we define a typed lambda-calculus that features operators for conducting experiments at runtime on probabilistic programs and for evaluating whether they compute outputs as determined by a target probability distribution. After proving some fundamental computational properties of the calculus, such as progress and termination, we define a static notion of confidence that allows to prove that our notion of trust behaves correctly with respect to the basic tenets of probability theory.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Ann Arbor Architecture for Agent-Oriented Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09903v1)** | 2025-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we reexamine prompt engineering for large language models through the lens of automata theory. We argue that language models function as automata and, like all automata, should be programmed in the languages they accept, a unified collection of all natural and formal languages. Therefore, traditional software engineering practices--conditioned on the clear separation of programming languages and natural languages--must be rethought. We introduce the Ann Arbor Architecture, a conceptual framework for agent-oriented programming of language models, as a higher-level abstraction over raw token generation, and provide a new perspective on in-context learning. Based on this framework, we present the design of our agent platform Postline, and report on our initial experiments in agent training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proof complexity of positive branching programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2102.06673v4)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the proof complexity of systems based on positive branching programs, i.e. non-deterministic branching programs (NBPs) where, for any 0-transition between two nodes, there is also a 1-transition. Positive NBPs compute monotone Boolean functions, just like negation-free circuits or formulas, but constitute a positive version of (non-uniform) NL, rather than P or NC1, respectively. The proof complexity of NBPs was investigated in previous work by Buss, Das and Knop, using extension variables to represent the dag-structure, over a language of (non-deterministic) decision trees, yielding the system eLNDT. Our system eLNDT+ is obtained by restricting their systems to a positive syntax, similarly to how the 'monotone sequent calculus' MLK is obtained from the usual sequent calculus LK by restricting to negation-free formulas. Our main result is that eLNDT+ polynomially simulates eLNDT over positive sequents. Our proof method is inspired by a similar result for MLK by Atserias, Galesi and Pudl\'ak, that was recently improved to a bona fide polynomial simulation via works of Je\v{r}\'abek and Buss, Kabanets, Kolokolova and Kouck\'y. Along the way we formalise several properties of counting functions within eLNDT+ by polynomial-size proofs and, as a case study, give explicit polynomial-size poofs of the propositional pigeonhole principle.</p></details> | 35 pages, 6 figures |

DSrepair uses knowledge graph based RAG for API knowledge retrieval as well as bug knowledge enrichment to construct repair prompts for LLMs. Specifically, to enable knowledge graph based API retrieval, we construct DS-KG (Data Science Knowledge Graph) for widely used data science libraries. For bug knowledge enrichment, we employ an abstract syntax tree (AST) to localize errors at the AST node level. DSrepair's effectiveness is evaluated against five state-of-the-art LLM-based repair baselines using four advanced LLMs on the DS-1000 dataset. The results show that DSrepair surpasses all five baselines. Specifically, when compared to the second-best baseline, DSrepair demonstrates significant improvements, fixing 44.4%, 14.2%, 20.6%, and 32.1% more buggy code snippets for each of the four evaluated LLMs, respectively. Additionally, it achieves greater efficiency, reducing the number of tokens required per code task by 17.49%, 34.24%, 24.71%, and 17.59%, respectively.</p></details> |  |

Our evaluation highlights three key findings: First, fine-tuning on API Pack enables open-source models to outperform GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 in generating code for entirely new API calls. We show this by fine-tuning CodeLlama-13B on 20,000 Python instances from API Pack. Second, fine-tuning on a large dataset in one language, combined with smaller datasets from others, improves API generation accuracy across multiple languages. Third, we confirm the benefits of larger datasets for API generalization, as increasing fine-tuning data to one million instances enhances generalization to new APIs. To support further research, we open-source the API Pack dataset, trained model, and code at https://github.com/zguo0525/API-Pack.</p></details> |  |

This prominence has spurred a significant body of research addressing various aspects of bus systems. In the literature, analytical approaches and mathematical programming are predominantly used to explore the Public Bus Transit Network Design Problem and Operations Planning (PBTNDP&OP). Part I of our study presented statistical analyses of literature applying these methodologies to PBTNDP&OP, along with a comprehensive review of analytical papers, highlighting the strengths and weaknesses of each approach. In Part II, we delve into the applications of mathematical programming within PBTNDP&OP, building upon the 15 major sub-categories identified in Part I. We have critically analyzed the identified papers within these sub-categories from various perspectives, including the problems investigated, modeling methods employed, decision variables, network structures, and key findings. This critical review highlights selected papers in each category. Finally, acknowledging existing research gaps, we propose potential extensions for future research. Despite the extensive array of publications, numerous topics still warrant further exploration. Notably, sustainable PBTNDP&OP and challenges associated with integrating emerging technologies are poised to dominate future research agendas.</p></details> |  |
| **[A systematic literature review on the application of analytical approaches and mathematical programming in public bus transit network design and operations planning: Part I](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09508v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Public Bus Transit Network Design Problem and Operations Planning (PBTNDP&OP) remains a core research area within transportation, in particular, because of the emergence of new transit technologies and services. Analytical approaches and mathematical programming are the most commonly applied methodologies to study this problem. Many studies utilize either of these two methods, often viewed as competing due to the unique benefits each provides that the other does not. This two-part paper systematically reviews the application of analytical approaches and mathematical programming in PBTNDP&OP, analyzing publications from 1968 to 2021. It begins by comparing analytical methods and mathematical programming through various statistical analyses, including the number of published papers, the most active journals and authors, keyword frequencies, keyword co-occurrence maps, and co-authorship maps. Subsequent analysis of the identified papers includes examinations from multiple perspectives: the problems investigated, modeling methods used, decision variables considered, network structures, and key findings. This is followed by a critical review of selected papers. The paper concludes by discussing the advantages and disadvantages of each approach and suggests potential extensions for future research based on identified gaps in existing studies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Answer Set Programming: Foundations and Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09235v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Answer Set Programming (ASP) is a powerful tool for solving real-world problems. However, many problems involve numeric values and complex constraints beyond the capabilities of standard ASP solvers. Hybrid solvers like CLINGCON and CLINGO[DL] address this by using specialized methods for specific constraints. However, these solvers lack a strong theoretical foundation. This issue has first been addressed by introducing the Logic of Here-and-There with constraints (HT_c) as an extension of the Logic of Here-and-There (HT) and its non-monotone extension Equilibrium Logic. Nowadays, HT serves as a logical foundation for ASP and has facilitated a broader understanding of this paradigm. The idea is that HTC (and other extensions) play an analogous role for hybrid ASP. There remain many open questions about these logics regarding their fundamental characteristics as well as their practical use in solvers, ie. how they can guide the implementation. Having a formal understanding of these hybrid logics is also needed to better understand the inherent structure of the (real-world) problems they are applied to and to improve their representations in ASP. As an example of an application of ASP we use product configuration.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2024, arXiv:2502.08453</p></details> |
| **[Relating Answer Set Programming and Many-sorted Logics for Formal Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.09230v1)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Answer Set Programming (ASP) is an important logic programming paradigm within the field of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning. As a concise, human-readable, declarative language, ASP is an excellent tool for developing trustworthy (especially, artificially intelligent) software systems. However, formally verifying ASP programs offers some unique challenges, such as 1. a lack of modularity (the meanings of rules are difficult to define in isolation from the enclosing program), 2. the ground-and-solve semantics (the meanings of rules are dependent on the input data with which the program is grounded), and 3. limitations of existing tools. My research agenda has been focused on addressing these three issues with the intention of making ASP verification an accessible, routine task that is regularly performed alongside program development. In this vein, I have investigated alternative semantics for ASP based on translations into the logic of here-and-there and many-sorted first-order logic. These semantics promote a modular understanding of logic programs, bypass grounding, and enable us to use automated theorem provers to automatically verify properties of programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2024, arXiv:2502.08453</p></details> |

These include tasks such as scheduling, routing, and production sequencing. Dynamic logics have traditionally addressed these needs but often lack the flexibility and integration required for comprehensive problem modeling. This research aims to extend Answer Set Programming (ASP), a powerful declarative problem-solving approach, to handle dynamic domains effectively. By integrating concepts from dynamic, temporal, and metric logics into ASP, we seek to develop robust systems capable of modeling complex dynamic problems and performing efficient reasoning tasks, thereby enhancing ASPs applicability in industrial contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2024, arXiv:2502.08453</p></details> |

By combining neural networks with Inductive Logic Programming (ILP), the goal is to construct systems that make accurate predictions and generate comprehensible rules to validate these predictions. Deep learning models process and analyze complex data, while ILP techniques derive logical rules to prove the network's conclusions. Explainable AI methods, like eXplainable Answer Set Programming (XASP), elucidate the reasoning behind these rules and decisions. The focus is on applying ILP frameworks, specifically ILASP and FastLAS, to enhance explainability in various domains. My test cases span weather prediction, the legal field, and image recognition. In weather forecasting, the system will predict events and provides explanations using FastLAS, with plans to integrate recurrent neural networks in the future. In the legal domain, the research focuses on interpreting vague decisions and assisting legal professionals by encoding Italian legal articles and learning reasoning patterns from Court of Cassation decisions using ILASP. For biological laboratories, we will collaborate with a research group to automate spermatozoa morphology classification for Bull Breeding Soundness Evaluation using YOLO networks and ILP to explain classification outcomes. This hybrid approach aims to bridge the gap between the high performance of deep learning models and the transparency of symbolic reasoning, advancing AI by providing interpretable and trustworthy applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2024, arXiv:2502.08453</p></details> |

It involves a simple transformation of the object program rules into metarules, which are then used by a metainterpreter to compute bottom up the model of the original program. The resulting algorithm is a form of semi-naive bottom-up evaluation. We discuss various reasons why this Prolog program is particularly interesting. In particular, this is perhaps the only Prolog program for which I find the use of Prolog's assert/1 to be intrinsic, easily understood, and the best, most perspicuous, way to program an algorithm. This short paper might be best characterized as a Prolog programming pearl.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2024, arXiv:2502.08453</p></details> |

In this paper we study techniques to elicit this knowledge in the form of several classes of logic programs, including propositional Horn clauses, Dual Horn clauses, relational triplets and Definite Clause Grammars. Exposing this knowledge as logic programs enables sound reasoning methods that can verify alignment of LLM outputs to their intended uses and extend their inference capabilities. We study new execution methods for the generated programs, including soft-unification of abducible facts against LLM-generated content stored in a vector database as well as GPU-based acceleration of minimal model computation that supports inference with large LLM-generated programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2024, arXiv:2502.08453</p></details> |

| **[Beyond Non-Degeneracy: Revisiting Certainty Equivalent Heuristic for Online Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01716v2)** | 2025-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Certainty Equivalent heuristic (CE) is a widely-used algorithm for various dynamic resource allocation problems in OR and OM. Despite its popularity, existing theoretical guarantees of CE are limited to settings satisfying restrictive fluid regularity conditions, particularly, the non-degeneracy conditions, under the widely held belief that the violation of such conditions leads to performance deterioration and necessitates algorithmic innovation beyond CE. In this work, we conduct a refined performance analysis of CE within the general framework of online linear programming. We show that CE achieves uniformly near-optimal regret (up to a polylogarithmic factor in $T$) under only mild assumptions on the underlying distribution, without relying on any fluid regularity conditions. Our result implies that, contrary to prior belief, CE effectively beats the curse of degeneracy for a wide range of problem instances with continuous conditional reward distributions, highlighting the distinction of the problem's structure between discrete and non-discrete settings. Our explicit regret bound interpolates between the mild $(\log T)^2$ regime and the worst-case $\sqrt{T}$ regime with a parameter $\beta$ quantifying the minimal rate of probability accumulation of the conditional reward distributions, generalizing prior findings in the multisecretary setting. To achieve these results, we develop novel algorithmic analytical techniques. Drawing tools from the empirical processes theory, we establish strong concentration analysis of the solutions to random linear programs, leading to improved regret analysis under significantly relaxed assumptions. These techniques may find potential applications in broader online decision-making contexts.</p></details> |  |
