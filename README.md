| **[Locally recoverable codes with multiple recovering sets from maximal curves](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15163v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a construction of locally recoverable codes (LRCs) with multiple recovery sets using algebraic curves with many rational points. By leveraging separable morphisms between smooth projective curves and expanding the class of curves previously considered, we significantly generalize and enhance the framework. Our approach corrects certain inaccuracies in the existing literature while extending results to a broader range of curves, thereby achieving better parameters and wider applicability. In addition, the constructions presented here result in LRCs with large availability.</p></details> |  |
| **[A.S.E: A Repository-Level Benchmark for Evaluating Security in AI-Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18106v3)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering necessitates rigorous security evaluation of their generated code. However, existing benchmarks often lack relevance to real-world AI-assisted programming scenarios, making them inadequate for assessing the practical security risks associated with AI-generated code in production environments. To address this gap, we introduce A.S.E (AI Code Generation Security Evaluation), a repository-level evaluation benchmark designed to closely mirror real-world AI programming tasks, offering a comprehensive and reliable framework for assessing the security of AI-generated code. Our evaluation of leading LLMs on A.S.E reveals several key findings. In particular, current LLMs still struggle with secure coding. The complexity in repository-level scenarios presents challenges for LLMs that typically perform well on snippet-level tasks. Moreover, a larger reasoning budget does not necessarily lead to better code generation. These observations offer valuable insights into the current state of AI code generation and help developers identify the most suitable models for practical tasks. They also lay the groundwork for refining LLMs to generate secure and efficient code in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Constructions and Lower Bounds for Maximally Recoverable Grid Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15013v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we continue the study of Maximally Recoverable (MR) Grid Codes initiated by Gopalan et al. [SODA 2017]. More precisely, we study codes over an $m \times n$ grid topology with one parity check per row and column of the grid along with $h \ge 1$ global parity checks. Previous works have largely focused on the setting in which $m = n$, where explicit constructions require field size which is exponential in $n$. Motivated by practical applications, we consider the regime in which $m,h$ are constants and $n$ is growing. In this setting, we provide a number of new explicit constructions whose field size is polynomial in $n$. We further complement these results with new field size lower bounds.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Heterogeneous Directed Hypergraph Neural Network over abstract syntax tree (AST) for Code Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2305.04228v5)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code classification is a difficult issue in program understanding and automatic coding. Due to the elusive syntax and complicated semantics in programs, most existing studies use techniques based on abstract syntax tree (AST) and graph neural networks (GNN) to create code representations for code classification. These techniques utilize the structure and semantic information of the code, but they only take into account pairwise associations and neglect the high-order data correlations that already exist between nodes of the same field or called attribute in the AST, which may result in the loss of code structural information. On the other hand, while a general hypergraph can encode high-order data correlations, it is homogeneous and undirected which will result in a lack of semantic and structural information such as node types, edge types, and directions between child nodes and parent nodes when modeling AST. In this study, we propose a heterogeneous directed hypergraph (HDHG) to represent AST and a heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) to process the graph for code classification. Our method improves code understanding and can represent high-order data correlations beyond paired interactions. We assess our heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) on public datasets of Python and Java programs. Our method outperforms previous AST-based and GNN-based methods, which demonstrates the capability of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 35th International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (SEKE 2023) as a regular paper; the latest version is consistent with the official conference version</p></details> |
| **[Four classes of LCD codes from (*)-(L,P)-twisted generalized Reed-Solomon codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14878v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>It's well-known that maximum distance separable codes (in short, MDS) and linear complementary dual (in short, LCD) codes are very important in coding theory and practice. In 2023, Yue et al. [25] constructed three classes of LCD MDS codes via (*)-TGRS codes. Recently, Wu et al. [27] generalized the results given by Yue et al. and constructed several classes of LCD MDS codes. In this paper, we unify their constructions by defining the (*)-(L,P)-twisted generalized Reed-Solomon (in short, (*)-(L,P)-TGRS) code, give the parity-check matrix of (*)-(L,P)-TGRS codes, and then construct four classes of LCD codes. Finally, some corresponding examples are given.</p></details> | 25pages |
| **[Do Code Semantics Help? A Comprehensive Study on Execution Trace-Based Information for Code Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11686v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have opened a new era in programming with their impressive capabilities. However, recent research has revealed critical limitations in their ability to reason about runtime behavior and understand the actual functionality of programs, which poses significant challenges for their post-training and practical deployment. Specifically, Code LLMs encounter two principal issues: (1) a lack of proficiency in reasoning about program execution behavior, as they struggle to interpret what programs actually do during runtime, and (2) the inconsistent and fragmented representation of semantic information, such as execution traces, across existing methods, which hinders their ability to generalize and reason effectively. These challenges underscore the necessity for more systematic approaches to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Code LLMs. To address these issues, we introduce a generic framework to support integrating semantic information~(e.g., execution trace) to code task-relevant prompts, and conduct a comprehensive study to explore the role of semantic information in enhancing the reasoning ability of Code LLMs accordingly. Specifically, we focus on investigating the usefulness of trace-based semantic information in boosting supervised fine-tuning~(SFT) and post-phase inference of Code LLMs. The experimental results surprisingly disagree with previous works and demonstrate that semantic information has limited usefulness for SFT and test time scaling of Code LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP2025-findings https://openreview.net/forum?id=d4ICISW2T4</p></details> |
| **[CodeFuse-CR-Bench: A Comprehensiveness-aware Benchmark for End-to-End Code Review Evaluation in Python Projects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14856v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code review (CR) is a key application for Large Language Models (LLMs), but progress is hampered by a "reality gap": existing benchmarks evaluate models on isolated sub-tasks using simplified, context-poor data. This fails to reflect the holistic context-rich nature of real-world CR. To bridge this gap, we introduce CodeFuse-CR-Bench, the first comprehensiveness-aware benchmark for repository-level CR evaluation. CodeFuse-CR-Bench comprises 601 high-quality instances from 70 Python projects covering nine Pull-Request (PR) problem domains, where each instance provides rich, multi-faceted context including the associated issue, PR details, and repository state, enabling end-to-end evaluation. Beyond superficial metrics, we also propose a novel evaluation framework that combines rule-based checks for location and syntax with model-based judgments of review quality. We present the first large-scale assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on this comprehensive CR task. Our results establish crucial baselines and reveal that (1) no single LLM dominates all aspects of CR; (2) Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves the highest comprehensive performance; and (3) different LLMs exhibit varying robustness to redundant context. These findings highlight the necessity of holistic, multi-dimensional evaluation and provide actionable insights for advancing truly intelligent yet practical CR assistants.</p></details> |  |

Our findings indicate that for any finite blocklength, a naive (uncoded) approach fails to offer any advantage over the ADC. Instead, sophisticated encoding strategies that leverage both classical error-correcting codes and quantum input states are crucial for realizing quantum performance gains at finite blocklengths.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted for presentation at the 2025 IEEE Information Theory Workshop (ITW 2025).

| **[RulER: Automated Rule-Based Semantic Error Localization and Repair for Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14829v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code translation aims to convert programs between different programming languages while maintaining their functionality. Due to the imperfections of code translation models, the generated translations may contain errors that compromise their reliability. Existing automated debugging methods for code translation rely on code alignments and repair patch templates to locate and fix erroneous translations. However, existing methods lack reliable references to construct code alignments and design repair patch templates, which significantly impacts their localization accuracy and repair effectiveness. To address these limitations, we reintroduce code translation rules and propose a rule-based debugging method for code translation, called RulER. RulER automatically derives code translation rules from correct translations generated by LLMs, enabling the efficient collection of diverse translation rules. In addition, RulER dynamically combines the existing rules on expandable nodes like expressions and tokens to further adaptively align more statements. These rules capture clear and detailed structural correspondences between source and target programming languages. Therefore, they can serve as reliable and reusable references for code alignment and repair template design, enabling RulER to locate and fix translation errors effectively. Our evaluation of RulER on Java-to-C++ and Python-to-C++ translations produced by four code translation models demonstrates that RulER outperforms state-of-the-art methods, BatFix and TransMap. Our experimental results show that RulER outperformed the best baseline by 20% and 272% in terms of error localization rates and repair success rates, respectively. RulER exhibits superior repair performance compared to directly prompting LLMs for patch generation, demonstrating a promising methodology for extracting and leveraging coding knowledge from LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to the limitation "The abstract field cannot be longer than 1,920 characters", the abstract here is shorter than that in the PDF file</p></details> |
| **[On the Use of Agentic Coding: An Empirical Study of Pull Requests on GitHub](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14745v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being integrated into software development processes. The ability to generate code and submit pull requests with minimal human intervention, through the use of autonomous AI agents, is poised to become a standard practice. However, little is known about the practical usefulness of these pull requests and the extent to which their contributions are accepted in real-world projects. In this paper, we empirically study 567 GitHub pull requests (PRs) generated using Claude Code, an agentic coding tool, across 157 diverse open-source projects. Our analysis reveals that developers tend to rely on agents for tasks such as refactoring, documentation, and testing. The results indicate that 83.8% of these agent-assisted PRs are eventually accepted and merged by project maintainers, with 54.9% of the merged PRs are integrated without further modification. The remaining 45.1% require additional changes benefit from human revisions, especially for bug fixes, documentation, and adherence to project-specific standards. These findings suggest that while agent-assisted PRs are largely acceptable, they still benefit from human oversight and refinement.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Use of Agentic Coding Manifests: An Empirical Study of Claude Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14744v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic coding tools receive goals written in natural language as input, break them down into specific tasks, and write/execute the actual code with minimal human intervention. Key to this process are agent manifests, configuration files (such as Claude.md) that provide agents with essential project context, identity, and operational rules. However, the lack of comprehensive and accessible documentation for creating these manifests presents a significant challenge for developers. We analyzed 253 Claude.md files from 242 repositories to identify structural patterns and common content. Our findings show that manifests typically have shallow hierarchies with one main heading and several subsections, with content dominated by operational commands, technical implementation notes, and high-level architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWE-QA: Can Language Models Answer Repository-level Code Questions?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14635v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and reasoning about entire software repositories is an essential capability for intelligent software engineering tools. While existing benchmarks such as CoSQA and CodeQA have advanced the field, they predominantly focus on small, self-contained code snippets. These setups fail to capture the complexity of real-world repositories, where effective understanding and reasoning often require navigating multiple files, understanding software architecture, and grounding answers in long-range code dependencies. In this paper, we present SWE-QA, a repository-level code question answering (QA) benchmark designed to facilitate research on automated QA systems in realistic code environments. SWE-QA involves 576 high-quality question-answer pairs spanning diverse categories, including intention understanding, cross-file reasoning, and multi-hop dependency analysis. To construct SWE-QA, we first crawled 77,100 GitHub issues from 11 popular repositories. Based on an analysis of naturally occurring developer questions extracted from these issues, we developed a two-level taxonomy of repository-level questions and constructed a set of seed questions for each category. For each category, we manually curated and validated questions and collected their corresponding answers. As a prototype application, we further develop SWE-QA-Agent, an agentic framework in which LLM agents reason and act to find answers automatically. We evaluate six advanced LLMs on SWE-QA under various context augmentation strategies. Experimental results highlight the promise of LLMs, particularly our SWE-QA-Agent framework, in addressing repository-level QA, while also revealing open challenges and pointing to future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/peng-weihan/SWE-QA-Bench</p></details> |
| **[Interactive Face Video Coding: A Generative Compression Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.09919v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a novel framework for Interactive Face Video Coding (IFVC), which allows humans to interact with the intrinsic visual representations instead of the signals. The proposed solution enjoys several distinct advantages, including ultra-compact representation, low delay interaction, and vivid expression/headpose animation. In particular, we propose the Internal Dimension Increase (IDI) based representation, greatly enhancing the fidelity and flexibility in rendering the appearance while maintaining reasonable representation cost. By leveraging strong statistical regularities, the visual signals can be effectively projected into controllable semantics in the three dimensional space (e.g., mouth motion, eye blinking, head rotation, head translation and head location), which are compressed and transmitted. The editable bitstream, which naturally supports the interactivity at the semantic level, can synthesize the face frames via the strong inference ability of the deep generative model. Experimental results have demonstrated the performance superiority and application prospects of our proposed IFVC scheme. In particular, the proposed scheme not only outperforms the state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) and the latest generative compression schemes in terms of rate-distortion performance for face videos, but also enables the interactive coding without introducing additional manipulation processes. Furthermore, the proposed framework is expected to shed lights on the future design of the digital human communication in the metaverse.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ensembling Large Language Models for Code Vulnerability Detection: An Empirical Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12629v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code vulnerability detection is crucial for ensuring the security and reliability of modern software systems. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in this domain. However, notable discrepancies in detection results often arise when analyzing identical code segments across different training stages of the same model or among architecturally distinct LLMs. While such inconsistencies may compromise detection stability, they also highlight a key opportunity: the latent complementarity among models can be harnessed through ensemble learning to create more robust vulnerability detection systems. In this study, we explore the potential of ensemble learning to enhance the performance of LLMs in source code vulnerability detection. We conduct comprehensive experiments involving five LLMs (i.e., DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B, CodeLlama-7B, CodeLlama-13B, CodeQwen1.5-7B, and StarCoder2-15B), using three ensemble strategies (i.e., Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking). These experiments are carried out across three widely adopted datasets (i.e., Devign, ReVeal, and BigVul). Inspired by Mixture of Experts (MoE) techniques, we further propose Dynamic Gated Stacking (DGS), a Stacking variant tailored for vulnerability detection. Our results demonstrate that ensemble approaches can significantly improve detection performance, with Boosting excelling in scenarios involving imbalanced datasets. Moreover, DGS consistently outperforms traditional Stacking, particularly in handling class imbalance and multi-class classification tasks. These findings offer valuable insights into building more reliable and effective LLM-based vulnerability detection systems through ensemble learning.</p></details> | 24 pages |

However, challenges remain in ensuring domain specificity, cost-effectiveness, and security - especially when relying on third-party APIs. This paper introduces CodeLSI, a framework that combines low-rank optimization and domain-specific instruction tuning to address these challenges. Objectives: The aim of this study is to develop and evaluate CodeLSI, a novel approach for generating high-quality code tailored to specific domains, using FMs fine-tuned on company infrastructure without dependence on external APIs. Methods: CodeLSI applies low-rank adaptation techniques to reduce the computational cost of model pre-training and fine-tuning. Domain-specific instruction tuning is employed to align code generation with organizational needs. We implemented and tested the framework on real-world JavaScript coding tasks using datasets drawn from internal software projects. Results: Experimental evaluations show that CodeLSI produces high-quality, context aware code. It outperforms baseline models in terms of relevance, accuracy, and domain fit. The use of low-rank optimization significantly reduced resource requirements, enabling scalable training on company-owned infrastructure. Conclusion: CodeLSI demonstrates that combining low-rank optimization with domain specific tuning can enhance the practicality and performance of FMs for automated code generation. This approach provides a secure, cost-efficient alternative to commercial API based solutions and supports faster, more targeted innovation in software development.</p></details> |  |

CS-FLEURS consists of 4 test sets which cover in total 113 unique code-switched language pairs across 52 languages: 1) a 14 X-English language pair set with real voices reading synthetically generated code-switched sentences, 2) a 16 X-English language pair set with generative text-to-speech 3) a 60 {Arabic, Mandarin, Hindi, Spanish}-X language pair set with the generative text-to-speech, and 4) a 45 X-English lower-resourced language pair test set with concatenative text-to-speech. Besides the four test sets, CS-FLEURS also provides a training set with 128 hours of generative text-to-speech data across 16 X-English language pairs. Our hope is that CS-FLEURS helps to broaden the scope of future code-switched speech research. Dataset link: https://huggingface.co/datasets/byan/cs-fleurs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interleaving Natural Language Prompting with Code Editing for Solving Programming Tasks with Generative AI Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14088v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, computing students often rely on both natural-language prompting and manual code editing to solve programming tasks. Yet we still lack a clear understanding of how these two modes are combined in practice, and how their usage varies with task complexity and student ability. In this paper, we investigate this through a large-scale study in an introductory programming course, collecting 13,305 interactions from 355 students during a three-day laboratory activity. Our analysis shows that students primarily use prompting to generate initial solutions, and then often enter short edit-run loops to refine their code following a failed execution. We find that manual editing becomes more frequent as task complexity increases, but most edits remain concise, with many affecting a single line of code. Higher-performing students tend to succeed using prompting alone, while lower-performing students rely more on edits. Student reflections confirm that prompting is helpful for structuring solutions, editing is effective for making targeted corrections, while both are useful for learning. These findings highlight the role of manual editing as a deliberate last-mile repair strategy, complementing prompting in AI-assisted programming workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[NL in the Middle: Code Translation with LLMs and Intermediate Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08627v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Studies show that large language models (LLMs) produce buggy code translations. One promising avenue to improve translation accuracy is through intermediate representations, which provide structured guidance for the translation process. We investigate whether LLM-based code translation can benefit from intermediate representations, specifically in the form of natural language (NL) summaries and abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Since prompt engineering greatly affects LLM performance, we consider several ways to integrate these representations, from one-shot to chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Using Open GPT4 8X7B and specialized StarCoder and CodeGen models on popular code translation benchmarks (CodeNet and AVATAR), we find that CoT with an intermediate NL summary performs best, with an increase of 13.8% and 6.7%, respectively, in successful translations for the best-performing model (Open GPT4 8X7B) compared to the zero-shot prompt.</p></details> |  |
| **[CLMTracing: Black-box User-level Watermarking for Code Language Model Tracing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13982v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread adoption of open-source code language models (code LMs), intellectual property (IP) protection has become an increasingly critical concern. While current watermarking techniques have the potential to identify the code LM to protect its IP, they have limitations when facing the more practical and complex demand, i.e., offering the individual user-level tracing in the black-box setting. This work presents CLMTracing, a black-box code LM watermarking framework employing the rule-based watermarks and utility-preserving injection method for user-level model tracing. CLMTracing further incorporates a parameter selection algorithm sensitive to the robust watermark and adversarial training to enhance the robustness against watermark removal attacks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate CLMTracing is effective across multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) code LMs, showing significant harmless improvements compared to existing SOTA baselines and strong robustness against various removal attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[COMI-LINGUA: Expert Annotated Large-Scale Dataset for Multitask NLP in Hindi-English Code-Mixing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21670v3)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce COMI-LINGUA, the largest manually annotated Hindi-English code-mixed dataset, comprising 125K+ high-quality instances across five core NLP tasks: Matrix Language Identification, Token-level Language Identification, Part-Of-Speech Tagging, Named Entity Recognition, and Machine Translation. Each instance is annotated by three bilingual annotators, yielding over 376K expert annotations with strong inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' Kappa $\geq$ 0.81). The rigorously preprocessed and filtered dataset covers both Devanagari and Roman scripts and spans diverse domains, ensuring real-world linguistic coverage. Evaluation reveals that closed-source LLMs significantly outperform traditional tools and open-source models in zero-shot settings. Notably, one-shot prompting consistently boosts performance across tasks, especially in structure-sensitive predictions like POS and NER. Fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs on COMI-LINGUA demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving up to 95.25 F1 in NER, 98.77 F1 in MLI, and competitive MT performance, setting new benchmarks for Hinglish code-mixed text.

| **[Posterior-GRPO: Rewarding Reasoning Processes in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05170v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced code generation for large language models (LLMs). However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based rewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning process. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising direction, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model learns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes. To address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively incorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable reasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference pairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score reasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method for reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs by systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along curated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical rigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other benchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method that conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying rewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO effectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning with final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior performance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only baselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo. We further demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by extending it to mathematical tasks. Our models, dataset, and code are publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Homomorphic encryption schemes based on coding theory and polynomials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13788v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Homomorphic encryption is a powerful cryptographic tool that enables secure computations on the private data. It evaluates any function for any operation securely on the encrypted data without knowing its corresponding plaintext. For original data $p$, $c$ denotes the ciphertext of the original plaintext $p$, i.e. $c = Encrypt_k(p)$. This is crucial for any sensitive application running in the Cloud, because we must protect data privacy even in the case when the server has falled victim to a cyber attack. The encryption scheme $Encrypt_k$ is said to be homomorphic with respect to some set of operations $\mathcal{O}$, if for any operation $\circ \in \mathcal{O}$ one can compute $Encrypt_k(p_1 \circ p_2)$ from $Encrypt_k(p_1) \circ Encrypt_k(p_2)$. Those schemes come in three forms: somewhat, partially and fully homomorphic. In this survey, we present the state of art of the known homomorphic encryption schemes based on coding theory and polynomials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Image Coding with Diffusion Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13768v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As generative technologies advance, visual content has evolved into a complex mix of natural and AI-generated images, driving the need for more efficient coding techniques that prioritize perceptual quality. Traditional codecs and learned methods struggle to maintain subjective quality at high compression ratios, while existing generative approaches face challenges in visual fidelity and generalization. To this end, we propose a novel generative coding framework leveraging diffusion priors to enhance compression performance at low bitrates. Our approach employs a pre-optimized encoder to generate generalized compressed-domain representations, integrated with the pretrained model's internal features via a lightweight adapter and an attentive fusion module. This framework effectively leverages existing pretrained diffusion models and enables efficient adaptation to different pretrained models for new requirements with minimal retraining costs. We also introduce a distribution renormalization method to further enhance reconstruction fidelity. Extensive experiments show that our method (1) outperforms existing methods in visual fidelity across low bitrates, (2) improves compression performance by up to 79% over H.266/VVC, and (3) offers an efficient solution for AI-generated content while being adaptable to broader content types.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Study on Thinking Patterns of Large Reasoning Models in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13758v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, many large language models (LLMs) are utilized for software engineering tasks such as code generation. The emergence of more advanced models known as large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o3, DeepSeek R1, and Qwen3. They have demonstrated the capability of performing multi-step reasoning. Despite the advancement in LRMs, little attention has been paid to systematically analyzing the reasoning patterns these models exhibit and how such patterns influence the generated code. This paper presents a comprehensive study aimed at investigating and uncovering the reasoning behavior of LRMs during code generation. We prompted several state-of-the-art LRMs of varying sizes with code generation tasks and applied open coding to manually annotate the reasoning traces. From this analysis, we derive a taxonomy of LRM reasoning behaviors, encompassing 15 reasoning actions across four phases. Our empirical study based on the taxonomy reveals a series of findings. First, we identify common reasoning patterns, showing that LRMs generally follow a human-like coding workflow, with more complex tasks eliciting additional actions such as scaffolding, flaw detection, and style checks. Second, we compare reasoning across models, finding that Qwen3 exhibits iterative reasoning while DeepSeek-R1-7B follows a more linear, waterfall-like approach. Third, we analyze the relationship between reasoning and code correctness, showing that actions such as unit test creation and scaffold generation strongly support functional outcomes, with LRMs adapting strategies based on task context. Finally, we evaluate lightweight prompting strategies informed by these findings, demonstrating the potential of context- and reasoning-oriented prompts to improve LRM-generated code.

Erasing Sensitive Memorization in Code Language Models via Machine Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13755v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Code Language Models (CLMs) have demonstrated superior performance in software engineering tasks such as code generation and summarization, recent empirical studies reveal a critical privacy vulnerability: these models exhibit unintended memorization of sensitive training data, enabling verbatim reproduction of confidential information when specifically prompted. To address this issue, several approaches, including training data de-duplication and differential privacy augmentation, have been proposed. However, these methods require full-model retraining for deployed CLMs, which incurs substantial computational costs. In this paper, we aim to answer the following research question: Can sensitive information memorized by CLMs be erased effectively and efficiently? We conduct a pioneering investigation into erasing sensitive memorization in CLMs through machine unlearning - a post-hoc modification method that removes specific information from trained models without requiring full retraining. Specifically, we first quantify the memorization risks of sensitive data within CLM training datasets and curate a high-risk dataset of 50,000 sensitive memorized samples as unlearning targets. We study two widely used gradient ascent-based unlearning approaches: the vanilla and constraint-based methods, and introduce CodeEraser, an advanced variant that selectively unlearns sensitive memorized segments in code while preserving the structural integrity and functional correctness of the surrounding code. Extensive experiments on three families of CLMs, i.e., CodeParrot, CodeGen-Mono, and Qwen2.5-Coder, validate the effectiveness and efficiency of CodeEraser in erasing targeted sensitive memorization while maintaining model utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 48th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026)</p></details> |

Due to the near real-time response requirements of this task, base models with small to medium-sized parameters are typically employed, supplemented by various optimization and post-training techniques. However, these optimization methods often have trade-offs, leading to a seesaw effect where performance improvements on certain datasets or metrics are accompanied by degradations on others -- sometimes even falling below the baseline model's performance. This paper proposes SynthCoder, a model that integrates leading industry practices to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion task. In specific, we first construct a diverse dataset by combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node extraction with heuristics that simulate developer behavior. Then we enrich our training corpus with cross-file contextual information using the BM25 algorithm and call graphs, enhancing the model's ability to perform code completion in both file-level and repository-level scenarios. As the last step, we employ a two-stage training process using the Seed-Coder-8B-Base as the base model. First, we fine-tune the model using Curriculum Learning technology. Following this, we perform alignment using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with preference pairs generated through Rejection Sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that our final model excels on mainstream repository-level code completion benchmarks, including aiXcoder, ExecRepoBench, CrossCodeEval, and CoLT. Furthermore, our carefully curated training set effectively mitigates the model's tendency to just repeat existing code, a common issue existing in various code completion models.</p></details> |  |
| **[LINC: An In-Network Coding Approach to Tame Packet Loss in Hybrid Wireless-Fiber Backbones](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13714v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The emergence of ultra-low latency applications, such as financial transactions, has driven the development of hybrid backbone networks that rely on fiber, satellite, and microwave links. Despite providing low latencies, these hybrid networks suffer from occasional environmental packet loss caused by poor weather, construction, and line of sight blockage. Paradoxically, today's hybrid backbones rely on conventional transport protocols that take packet loss to signal network congestion, as opposed to transient environmental obstacles. A common approach to address this challenge is to use network coding (NC) between the end hosts to recover from these occasional packet loss events. However, current NC proposals assume full access to the end-hosts' stack to perform end-to-end encoding/decoding operations. In this paper, we introduce LINC, a novel system that provides in-network NC capabilities to mitigate environmental packet loss events without requiring cooperation from the end hosts. LINC uses a systematic block coding approach on a link-by-link basis, encoding and decoding packets inside the network. We model the tradeoff in goodput between end-to-end retransmissions and redundant packets introduced by LINC, and propose an optimization formulation to determine the optimal choice of coding parameters. Our simulations on real-world backbone topologies demonstrate that LINC reduces the end-to-end latency by up to 18% by eliminating unnecessary retransmissions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantic Alignment-Enhanced Code Translation via an LLM-Based Multi-Agent System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.19894v4)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation converts code from one programming language to another while maintaining its original functionality, which is crucial for software migration, system refactoring, and cross-platform development. Traditional rule-based methods rely on manually-written rules, which can be time-consuming and often result in less readable code. To overcome this, learning-based methods have been developed, leveraging parallel data to train models for automated code translation. More recently, the advance of Large Language Models (LLMs) further boosts learning-based code translation. Although promising, LLM-translated program still suffers from diverse quality issues (e.g., syntax errors and semantic errors). In particular, it can be challenging for LLMs to self-debug these errors when simply provided with the corresponding error messages. In this work, we propose a novel LLM-based multi-agent system TRANSAGENT, which enhances LLM-based code translation by fixing the syntax errors and semantic errors with the synergy between four LLM-based agents, including Initial Code Translator, Syntax Error Fixer, Code Aligner, and Semantic Error Fixer. The main insight of TRANSAGENT is to first localize the error code block in the target program based on the execution alignment between the target and source program, which can narrow down the fixing space and thus lower down the fixing difficulties. To evaluate TRANSAGENT, we first construct a new benchmark from recent programming tasks to mitigate the potential data leakage issue. On our benchmark, TRANSAGENT outperforms the latest LLM-based code translation technique UniTrans in both translation effectiveness and efficiency; additionally, our evaluation on different LLMs show the generalization of TRANSAGENT and our ablation study shows the contribution of each agent.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we integrate Error-Correcting Output Codes (ECOC) into the KAN framework to transform multi-class classification into multiple binary tasks, improving robustness via Hamming distance decoding. Our proposed KAN with ECOC framework outperforms vanilla KAN on a challenging blood cell classification dataset, achieving higher accuracy across diverse hyperparameter settings. Ablation studies further confirm that ECOC consistently enhances performance across FastKAN and FasterKAN variants. These results demonstrate that ECOC integration significantly boosts KAN generalizability in critical healthcare AI applications. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work of ECOC with KAN for enhancing multi-class medical image classification performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE BioCAS 2025</p></details> |

We derive generic formula for a transversal $T$ gate of color codes on general 3-manifolds, which acts as collective non-Clifford logical CCZ gates on any triplet of logical qubits with their logical-$X$ membranes having a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ triple intersection at a single point. The triple intersection number is a topological invariant, which also arises in the path integral of the emergent higher symmetry operator in a topological quantum field theory: the $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory. Moreover, the transversal $S$ gate of the color code corresponds to a higher-form symmetry supported on a codimension-1 submanifold, giving rise to exponentially many addressable and parallelizable logical CZ gates. A construction of constant-depth circuits of the above logical gates via cup product cohomology operation is also presented for three copies of identical toric codes on arbitrary 3-manifolds. We have developed a generic formalism to compute the triple intersection invariants for 3-manifolds. We further develop three types of LDPC codes supporting such logical gates: (1) A quasi-hyperbolic code from the product of 2D hyperbolic surface and a circle, with almost-constant rate $k/n=O(1/\log(n))$ and $O(\log(n))$ distance; (2) A homological fibre bundle code with $O(1/\log^{\frac{1}{2}}(n))$ rate and $O(\log^{\frac{1}{2}}(n))$ distance; (3) A specific family of 3D hyperbolic codes: the Torelli mapping torus code, constructed from mapping tori of a pseudo-Anosov element in the Torelli subgroup, which has constant rate while the distance scaling is currently unknown. We then show a generic constant-overhead scheme for applying a parallelizable universal gate set with the aid of logical-$X$ measurements.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 32 figures. In the updated version v2, we have simplified the TQFT derivation of the logical gates via an operator-valued cochain formalism in Sec.

| **[Prompt Stability in Code LLMs: Measuring Sensitivity across Emotion- and Personality-Driven Variations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13680v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation models are widely used in software development, yet their sensitivity to prompt phrasing remains under-examined. Identical requirements expressed with different emotions or communication styles can yield divergent outputs, while most benchmarks emphasize only peak performance. We present PromptSE (Prompt Sensitivity Evaluation), a framework that creates semantically equivalent prompt variants with emotion and personality templates, and that evaluates stability using probability aware continuous scoring or using binary pass rates when logits are unavailable. The results are aggregated into a proposed area under curve metric (AUC-E) for cross model comparison. Across 14 models from three families (Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek), our study shows that performance and stability behave as largely decoupled optimization objectives, and it reveals architectural and scale related patterns that challenge common assumptions about model robustness. The framework supports rapid screening for closed-source models as well as detailed stability analysis in research settings. PromptSE enables practitioners to quantify performance stability trade offs for deployment and model selection, positioning prompt stability as a complementary evaluation dimension alongside performance and fairness, and contributing to more trustworthy AI-assisted software development tools.</p></details> |  |

This study evaluates the effectiveness of GitHub Copilot's recently introduced code review feature in detecting security vulnerabilities. Using a curated set of labeled vulnerable code samples drawn from diverse open-source projects spanning multiple programming languages and application domains, we systematically assessed Copilot's ability to identify and provide feedback on common security flaws. Contrary to expectations, our results reveal that Copilot's code review frequently fails to detect critical vulnerabilities such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and insecure deserialization. Instead, its feedback primarily addresses low-severity issues, such as coding style and typographical errors. These findings expose a significant gap between the perceived capabilities of AI-assisted code review and its actual effectiveness in supporting secure development practices. Our results highlight the continued necessity of dedicated security tools and manual code audits to ensure robust software security.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods often fail to capture the subtle phonological shifts inherent in CS scenarios. The challenge is particularly difficult for language pairs like Vietnamese and English, where both distinct phonological features and the ambiguity arising from similar sound recognition are present. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for Vietnamese-English CS ASR, a Two-Stage Phoneme-Centric model (TSPC). The TSPC employs a phoneme-centric approach, built upon an extended Vietnamese phoneme set as an intermediate representation to facilitate mixed-lingual modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that TSPC consistently outperforms existing baselines, including PhoWhisper-base, in Vietnamese-English CS ASR, achieving a significantly lower word error rate of 20.8\% with reduced training resources. Furthermore, the phonetic-based two-stage architecture enables phoneme adaptation and language conversion to enhance ASR performance in complex CS Vietnamese-English ASR scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>I nee...</summary><p>I need to withdraw the paper as there something wrong</p></details> |

This specific structure of the parity-check matrix was employed to enhance the first phase of the decoding algorithm through the expansion of the syndrome support. However, this expansion decreases the probability of recovering the error support in the second phase of the decoding algorithm. This paper introduces a novel method based on successive intersections to recover the error support. This method offers two key advantages: it increases the probability of successful decoding and enables the decoding of a greater number of errors.</p></details> |  |

Thus, understanding the perceptions of these key actors about this new dynamic is critical. This exploratory study contributes to this area by investigating how these tools are shaping the experiences of novice programmers in an introductory programming course. Through a two-part exam, we investigated student perceptions by first providing access to AI support for a programming task and then requiring an extension of the solution without it. We collected Likert-scale and open-ended responses from 20 students to understand their perceptions on the challenges they faced. Our findings reveal that students perceived AI tools as helpful for grasping code concepts and boosting their confidence during the initial development phase. However, a noticeable difficulty emerged when students were asked to work unaided, pointing to potential overreliance and gaps in foundational knowledge transfer. These insights highlight a critical need for new pedagogical approaches that integrate AI effectively while effectively enhancing core programming skills, rather than impersonating them.</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A shorter version of the manuscript (16 pages) has been accepted for publication in the Proceedings of 19th Colombian Conference on Computing, CCC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Code Embeddings and ML Classifiers for Python Source Code Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13134v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the growing complexity and scale of source code have rendered manual software vulnerability detection increasingly impractical. To address this challenge, automated approaches leveraging machine learning and code embeddings have gained substantial attention. This study investigates the optimal combination of code embedding techniques and machine learning classifiers for vulnerability detection in Python source code. We evaluate three embedding techniques, i.e., Word2Vec, CodeBERT, and GraphCodeBERT alongside two deep learning classifiers, i.e., Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) networks and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). While CNN paired with GraphCodeBERT exhibits strong performance, the BiLSTM model using Word2Vec consistently achieves superior overall results. These findings suggest that, despite the advanced architectures of recent models like CodeBERT and GraphCodeBERT, classical embeddings such as Word2Vec, when used with sequence-based models like BiLSTM, can offer a slight yet consistent performance advantage. The study underscores the critical importance of selecting appropriate combinations of embeddings and classifiers to enhance the effectiveness of automated vulnerability detection systems, particularly for Python source code.</p></details> |  |

A Case Study on English-Korean Code-Switching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18436v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate multilingual abilities, yet they are English-centric due to dominance of English in training corpora. The limited resource for low-resource languages remains a crucial challenge. Code-switching (CS), a phenomenon where multilingual speakers alternate between languages in a discourse, can convey subtle cultural and linguistic nuances that can be otherwise lost in translation and elicits language-specific knowledge in human communications. In light of this, we investigate whether code-switching can activate, or identify and leverage knowledge for reasoning when LLMs solve low-resource language tasks. To facilitate the research, we first present EnKoQA, a synthetic English-Korean CS question-answering dataset. We provide comprehensive analysis on a variety of multilingual LLMs by subdividing activation process into knowledge identification and knowledge leveraging. Our results demonstrate that compared to English text, CS can faithfully activate knowledge inside LLMs especially on language-specific domains, suggesting the potential of code-switching on low-resource language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |

Equipment languages such as the Algorithmic Pattern Generator (ALPG) are critical for precise hardware control but are challenging to program due to their low-level syntax and steep learning curve. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level code from natural language, their effectiveness on low-level equipment languages remains limited. To address this, we propose Progressive Knowledge Enhancement (PKE), a novel multi-stage prompting framework that progressively extracts and activates the latent knowledge within LLMs, guiding them from simple to complex examples without extensive fine-tuning. Empirical evaluation on an industrial ALPG dataset shows that PKE significantly outperforms standard prompting and surpasses state-of-the-art methods in generating correct ALPG code, achieving 11.1\% and 15.2\% higher exact match scores compared to the second-best technique. Further analysis of individual components confirms that progressive knowledge extraction based on difficulty enhances accuracy. Our study offer a practical approach to boosting LLM capabilities for specialized low-level programming, supporting greater productivity in semiconductor software development.</p></details> |  |

However, their further advancements are often constrained by the scarcity of real-world coding problems. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel framework for synthesizing code problems that emulate authentic real-world scenarios. This framework systematically integrates domain knowledge, domain skills, and coding skills, all of which are meticulously extracted from real-world programming-related datasets, including Stack Overflow and Kaggle. The extracted elements serve as the foundational building blocks for constructing code problems. To align the generated problems with practical applications, application scenarios are also mined from the aforementioned datasets. These scenarios are then utilized to construct a scenario-centric graph that interconnects domain knowledge, domain skills, and coding skills. Based on this structured representation, a sampling strategy on the graph is designed, which effectively controls the generation of a code problem with complexity and diversity, reflects real-world challenges. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves superior performance over state-of-the-art open-source large language models of varying sizes and functionalities, including both coders and general-purpose models, across a diverse set of real-world benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a novel detection pipeline that integrates custom Slither-based detectors, LLMs, Kontrol, and Forge. Our approach is designed to reliably detect defects and generate proofs. We currently perform experiments with promising results for seven types of critical defects. We demonstrate the pipeline's efficacy by presenting our findings for three vulnerabilities -- Reentrancy, Complex Fallback, and Faulty Access Control Policies -- that are challenging for current verification solutions, which often generate false alarms or fail to detect them entirely. We highlight the potential of either symbolic or concrete execution in correctly classifying such code faults. By chaining these instruments, our method effectively validates true positives, significantly reducing the manual verification burden. Although we identify potential limitations, such as the inconsistency and the cost of LLMs, our findings establish a robust framework for combining heuristic analysis with formal verification to achieve more reliable and automated smart contract auditing.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings FROM 2025, arXiv:2509.11877</p></details> |

Yet comparative evidence on how model choice, prompt design, and prompt language shape translation quality across multiple programming languages remains limited. This study conducts a systematic empirical assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs for code translation among C++, Java, Python, and C#, alongside a traditional baseline (TransCoder). Using BLEU and CodeBLEU, we quantify syntactic fidelity and structural correctness under two prompt styles (concise instruction and detailed specification) and two prompt languages (English and Arabic), with direction-aware evaluation across language pairs. Experiments show that detailed prompts deliver consistent gains across models and translation directions, and English prompts outperform Arabic by 13-15%. The top-performing model attains the highest CodeBLEU on challenging pairs such as Java to C# and Python to C++. Our evaluation shows that each LLM outperforms TransCoder across the benchmark. These results demonstrate the value of careful prompt engineering and prompt language choice, and provide practical guidance for software modernization and cross-language interoperability.</p></details> |  |

Their strong error-correcting abilities and efficient encoding and decoding methods make BCH codes widely applicable in various areas, including communication systems, data storage devices, and consumer electronics. Although BCH codes have been extensively studied, the parameters of BCH codes are not known in general. Let $q$ be a prime power and $m$ be a positive integer. Denote by $\mathcal{C}_{\left(q,m,\delta)\right)}$ the narrow-sense primitive BCH code with length $q^m-1$ and designed distance $\delta$. As of now, the dimensions of $\mathcal{C}_{(q,m,\delta)}$ are fully understood only for $m \leq 2$. For $m \geq 4$, the dimensions of $\mathcal{C}_{(q,m,\delta)}$ are known only for the range $2 \leq \delta \leq q^{\lfloor (m+1)/2 \rfloor +1}$ and for a limited number of special cases. In this paper, we determined the dimension and Bose distance of $\mathcal{C}_{(q,m,\delta)}$ for $m\geq 4$ and $\delta\in [2, q^{\lfloor ( 2m-1)/{3}\rfloor+1}]. $ Additionally, we have also extended our results to some primitive BCH codes that are not necessarily narrow-sense.</p></details> |  |
| **[Teaching Your Models to Understand Code via Focal Preference Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02783v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Preference learning extends the performance of Code LLMs beyond traditional supervised fine-tuning by leveraging relative quality comparisons. In existing approaches, a set of n candidate solutions is evaluated based on test case success rates, with the candidate demonstrating a higher pass rate being labeled as positive and its counterpart with a lower pass rate as negative. However, because this approach aligns entire failing code blocks rather than pinpointing specific errors, it lacks the granularity necessary to capture meaningful error-correction relationships. As a result, the model is unable to learn more informative error-correction patterns. To address these issues, we propose Target-DPO, a new preference alignment framework that mimics human iterative debugging to refine Code LLMs. Target-DPO explicitly locates error regions and aligns the corresponding tokens via a tailored DPO algorithm. To facilitate it, we introduce the CodeFlow dataset, where samples are iteratively refined until passing tests, with modifications capturing error corrections. Extensive experiments show that a diverse suite of Code LLMs equipped with Target-DPO achieves significant performance gains in code generation and improves on challenging tasks like BigCodeBench. In-depth analysis reveals that Target-DPO yields fewer errors. Code, model and datasets are in: https://github.com/JieWu02/Target-DPO.</p></details> | Accepted by EMNLP'25 |

The tedious nature of manual code documentation has led to much research on automated documentation generation. Existing automated approaches primarily focused on code summarization, leaving a gap in template-based documentation generation (e.g., Javadoc), particularly with publicly available Large Language Models (LLMs). Furthermore, progress in this area has been hindered by the lack of a Javadoc-specific dataset that incorporates modern language features, provides broad framework/library coverage, and includes necessary contextual information. This study aims to address these gaps by developing a tailored dataset and assessing the capabilities of publicly available LLMs for context-aware, template-based Javadoc generation. In this work, we present a novel, context-aware dataset for Javadoc generation that includes critical structural and semantic information from modern Java codebases. We evaluate five open-source LLMs (including LLaMA-3.1, Gemma-2, Phi-3, Mistral, Qwen-2.5) using zero-shot, few-shot, and fine-tuned setups and provide a comparative analysis of their performance. Our results demonstrate that LLaMA 3.1 performs consistently well and is a reliable candidate for practical, automated Javadoc generation, offering a viable alternative to proprietary systems.</p></details> |  |

It is a challenging task to construct symbol-pair codes with optimal parameters, especially, maximum-distance-separable (MDS) symbol-pair codes. In this paper, the permutation equivalence codes of matrix-product codes with underlying matrices of orders $3$ and $4$ are used to extend the minimum symbol-pair distance, four new classes of MDS symbol-pair codes and a new class of AMDS symbol-pair codes are derived.</p></details> | 24 pages,1 table |

However, their frequent generation of insecure code presents serious risks. We present a comprehensive evaluation of seven parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques, demonstrating substantial gains in secure code generation without compromising functionality. Our research identifies prompt-tuning as the most effective PEFT method, achieving an 80.86% Overall-Secure-Rate on CodeGen2 16B, a 13.5-point improvement over the 67.28% baseline. Optimizing decoding strategies through sampling temperature further elevated security to 87.65%. This equates to a reduction of approximately 203,700 vulnerable code snippets per million generated. Moreover, prompt and prefix tuning increase robustness against poisoning attacks in our TrojanPuzzle evaluation, with strong performance against CWE-79 and CWE-502 attack vectors. Our findings generalize across Python and Java, confirming prompt-tuning's consistent effectiveness.

Benchmarking LLMs as Data Science Code Debuggers for Multi-Hop and Multi-Bug Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22388v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are transforming software development, yet current code generation and code repair benchmarks mainly assess syntactic and functional correctness in simple, single-error cases. LLMs' capabilities to autonomously find and fix runtime logical errors in complex data science code remain largely unexplored. To address this gap, we introduce DSDBench: the Data Science Debugging Benchmark, the first benchmark for systematic evaluation of LLMs on multi-hop error tracing and multi-bug detection in data science code debugging. DSDBench adapts datasets from existing data science task benchmarks, such as DABench and MatPlotBench, featuring realistic data science debugging tasks with automatically synthesized multi-hop, multi-bug code snippets. DSDBench includes 1,117 annotated samples with 741 cause-effect error pairs and runtime error messages. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on DSDBench show significant performance gaps, highlighting challenges in debugging logical runtime errors in data science code. DSDBench offers a crucial resource to evaluate and improve LLMs' debugging and reasoning capabilities, enabling more reliable AI-assisted data science in the future. DSDBench is publicly available at github.com/KevinCL16/DSDBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at EMNLP 2025 Main, Oral</p></details> |

However, their non-linear, event-driven dynamics pose significant challenges for training, and existing methods often deviate from neuroscientific principles of cortical learning. Drawing inspiration from predictive coding theory-a leading model of brain information processing-we propose PC-SNN, a novel learning framework that integrates predictive coding with SNNs to enable biologically plausible, local Hebbian plasticity without reliance on backpropagation. Unlike conventional SNN training approaches, PC-SNN leverages only local computations, aligning with the brain's distributed processing and overcoming the biological implausibility of global error propagation. Our classification model achieves competitive performance on the benchmark datasets, including Caltech Face/Motorbike, MNIST, and CIFAR10, surpassing state-of-the-art multi-layer SNNs. Furthermore, our predictive coding-based regression model outperforms backpropagation-based methods while adhering to local plasticity constraints, offering a scalable and biologically grounded alternative for SNN training. PC-SNN drives progress in neuromorphic computing through validating the adaptability of bio-inspired algorithms within spiking neural architectures, but also unveils novel understandings of neurocognitive learning processes, presenting a conceptual framework distinguished by its theoretical originality and functional efficacy.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Good Vibrations? A Qualitative Study of Co-Creation, Communication, Flow, and Trust in Vibe Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12491v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vibe coding, a term coined by Andrej Karpathy in February 2025, has quickly become a compelling and controversial natural language programming paradigm in AI-assisted software development. Centered on iterative co-design with an AI assistant, vibe coding emphasizes flow and experimentation over strict upfront specification. While initial studies have begun to explore this paradigm, most focus on analyzing code artifacts or proposing theories with limited empirical backing. There remains a need for a grounded understanding of vibe coding as it is perceived and experienced by developers. We present the first systematic qualitative investigation of vibe coding perceptions and practice. Drawing on over 190,000 words from semi-structured interviews, Reddit threads, and LinkedIn posts, we characterize what vibe coding is, why and how developers use it, where it breaks down, and which emerging practices aim to support it. We propose a qualitatively grounded theory of vibe coding centered on conversational interaction with AI, co-creation, and developer flow and joy. We find that AI trust regulates movement along a continuum from delegation to co-creation and supports the developer experience by sustaining flow. We surface recurring pain points and risks in areas including specification, reliability, debugging, latency, code review burden, and collaboration. We also present best practices that have been discovered and shared to mitigate these challenges. We conclude with implications for the future of AI dev tools and directions for researchers investigating vibe coding.</p></details> | 19 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Building Coding Agents via Entropy-Enhanced Multi-Turn Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12434v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software engineering presents complex, multi-step challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring reasoning over large codebases and coordinated tool use. The difficulty of these tasks is exemplified by benchmarks like SWE-bench, where current LLMs still struggle to resolve real-world issues. A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but its gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs. While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs with human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity, limiting the effectiveness of TTS. Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically designed for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of multi-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce \sys, an entropy-enhanced framework that adapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn, tool-assisted setting. \sys augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than single-turn responses. We validate \sys by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different families and sizes (up to 106B parameters). To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid best-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model free approaches. On the \swebench leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art results among open-weight models. A 30B parameter model trained with \sys ranks 1st on \lite and 4th on \verified on the open-weight leaderboard, surpassed only by models with over 10x more parameters(\eg$>$350B).</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Large Language Models for Functional and Maintainable Code in Industrial Settings: A Case Study at ASML](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12395v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have shown impressive performance in various domains, including code generation across diverse open-source domains. However, their applicability in proprietary industrial settings, where domain-specific constraints and code interdependencies are prevalent, remains largely unexplored. We present a case study conducted in collaboration with the leveling department at ASML to investigate the performance of LLMs in generating functional, maintainable code within a closed, highly specialized software environment. We developed an evaluation framework tailored to ASML's proprietary codebase and introduced a new benchmark. Additionally, we proposed a new evaluation metric, build@k, to assess whether LLM-generated code successfully compiles and integrates within real industrial repositories. We investigate various prompting techniques, compare the performance of generic and code-specific LLMs, and examine the impact of model size on code generation capabilities, using both match-based and execution-based metrics. The findings reveal that prompting techniques and model size have a significant impact on output quality, with few-shot and chain-of-thought prompting yielding the highest build success rates. The difference in performance between the code-specific LLMs and generic LLMs was less pronounced and varied substantially across different model families.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE 2025 (Industry track)</p></details> |
| **[EfficientUICoder: Efficient MLLM-based UI Code Generation via Input and Output Token Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12159v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models have demonstrated exceptional performance in UI2Code tasks, significantly enhancing website development efficiency. However, these tasks incur substantially higher computational overhead than traditional code generation due to the large number of input image tokens and extensive output code tokens required. Our comprehensive study identifies significant redundancies in both image and code tokens that exacerbate computational complexity and hinder focus on key UI elements, resulting in excessively lengthy and often invalid HTML files. We propose EfficientUICoder, a compression framework for efficient UI code generation with three key components. First, Element and Layout-aware Token Compression preserves essential UI information by detecting element regions and constructing UI element trees. Second, Region-aware Token Refinement leverages attention scores to discard low-attention tokens from selected regions while integrating high-attention tokens from unselected regions. Third, Adaptive Duplicate Token Suppression dynamically reduces repetitive generation by tracking HTML/CSS structure frequencies and applying exponential penalties. Extensive experiments show EfficientUICoderachieves a 55%-60% compression ratio without compromising webpage quality and delivers superior efficiency improvements: reducing computational cost by 44.9%, generated tokens by 41.4%, prefill time by 46.6%, and inference time by 48.8% on 34B-level MLLMs. Code is available at https://github.com/WebPAI/EfficientUICoder.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniPar: A Unified LLM-Based Framework for Parallel and Accelerated Code Translation in HPC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12136v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating programs between various parallel programming languages is an important problem in the high-performance computing (HPC) community. Existing tools for this problem are either too narrow in scope and/or outdated. Recent explosive growth in the popularity of large language models (LLMs) and their ability to generate and translate code offers a potential alternative approach. Toward that end, we first need to systematically evaluate the ability of LLMs to translate between parallel languages. In this work, we introduce UniPar, a systematic evaluation framework for LLM-based parallel code translation. Specifically, in this work, we target translations between serial code, CUDA, and OpenMP. Our goal is to assess how well current instruction-tuned LLMs -- specifically GPT-4o-mini and LLaMA-3.3-70B-Instruct -- can be used out of the box or enhanced through known strategies. We evaluated four major usage modes: hyperparameter optimization for decoding, zero- and few-shot prompting, supervised fine-tuning, and iterative feedback through compiler-based repair. As a part of the evaluation, we construct a new dataset called PARATRANS, covering both serial-to-parallel translation and cross-paradigm transformations. Our findings reveal that while off-the-shelf models struggle under the default settings (e.g., GPT-4o-mini achieves only 46% compilation and 15% functional correctness), our UniPar methodology -- combining fine-tuning, hyperparameter tuning, and compiler-guided repair -- improves performance by up to 2X (69% compilation and 33% correctness). We believe that our findings will provide useful insights for researchers to further improve LLMs for the parallel language translation problem. UniPar source code and PARATRANS dataset are available at our GitHub repository https://github.com/Scientific-Computing-Lab/UniPar_AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to IEEE HPEC conference 2025. 9 pages, incl references</p></details> |
| **[A New Benchmark for Evaluating Code Translation with Third-Party Libraries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12087v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely studied in the code translation field on the method, class, and even repository levels. However, most of these benchmarks are limited in terms of Third-Party Library (TPL) categories and scales, making TPL-related errors hard to expose and hindering the development of targeted solutions. Considering the high dependence (over 90%) on TPLs in practical programming, demystifying and analyzing LLMs' code translation performance involving various TPLs becomes imperative. To address this gap, we construct TransLibEval, the first benchmark dedicated to library-centric code translation. It consists of 200 real-world tasks across Python, Java, and C++, each explicitly involving TPLs from diverse categories such as data processing, machine learning, and web development, with comprehensive dependency coverage and high-coverage test suites. We evaluate seven recent LLMs of commercial, general, and code-specialized families under six translation strategies of three categories: Direct, IR-guided, and Retrieval-augmented. Experimental results show a dramatic performance drop compared with library-free settings (average CA decline over 60%), while diverse strategies demonstrate heterogeneous advantages. Furthermore, we analyze 4,831 failed cases from GPT-4o, one of the State-of-the-Art (SOTA) LLMs, revealing numerous third-party reference errors that were obscured previously. These findings highlight the unique challenges of library-centric translation and provide practical guidance for improving TPL-aware code intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[SAQ: Pushing the Limits of Vector Quantization through Code Adjustment and Dimension Segmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12086v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Approximate Nearest Neighbor Search (ANNS) plays a critical role in applications such as search engines, recommender systems, and RAG for LLMs. Vector quantization (VQ), a crucial technique for ANNS, is commonly used to reduce space overhead and accelerate distance computations. However, despite significant research advances, state-of-the-art VQ methods still face challenges in balancing encoding efficiency and quantization accuracy. To address these limitations, we propose a novel VQ method called SAQ. To improve accuracy, SAQ employs a new dimension segmentation technique to strategically partition PCA-projected vectors into segments along their dimensions. By prioritizing leading dimension segments with larger magnitudes, SAQ allocates more bits to high-impact segments, optimizing the use of the available space quota. An efficient dynamic programming algorithm is developed to optimize dimension segmentation and bit allocation, ensuring minimal quantization error. To speed up vector encoding, SAQ devises a code adjustment technique to first quantize each dimension independently and then progressively refine quantized vectors using a coordinate-descent-like approach to avoid exhaustive enumeration. Extensive experiments demonstrate SAQ's superiority over classical methods (e.g., PQ, PCA) and recent state-of-the-art approaches (e.g., LVQ, Extended RabitQ). SAQ achieves up to 80% reduction in quantization error and accelerates encoding speed by over 80x compared to Extended RabitQ.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 12 figures, accepted by SIGMOD</p></details> |

Besides offering a programmatic API for these functionalities, LitterBox+ also extends the Scratch user interface to make these functionalities available directly in the environment familiar to learners. The framework is designed to be easily extensible with other prompts, LLM providers, and new features combining the program analysis capabilities of LitterBox with the generative features of LLMs. We provide a screencast demonstrating the tool at https://youtu.be/RZ6E0xgrIgQ.</p></details> | <details><summary>ASE 2...</summary><p>ASE 2025 Tool Demonstration Track</p></details> |

At the heart of the process lie two sophisticated families of codes: LDPC and polar codes. This paper opens the black box, not only by explaining how these codes are designed, but also by showing how they are encoded and decoded in practice. To map where research currently stands, we present a detailed survey of the literature supplemented with insights that are often buried deep within technical standards. These foundations are not just historical footnotes: they are strong candidates for powering error correction in 6G and beyond. In bringing clarity to these building blocks, we aim to help engineers and researchers navigate what is both a complex and increasingly vital part of wireless communication.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we study how to implement it for the family of first-order Generalized Reed-Muller codes. Then, we give examples which show that we improve the number of errors we can correct in comparison with the known results for this family of codes. Finally, we deal, from a probabilistic point of view, with the problem of determining when the algorithm only needs to use a smaller PD-like set.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Evaluation to Enhancement: Large Language Models for Zero-Knowledge Proof Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11708v1)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) are increasingly deployed in domains such as privacy-preserving authentication, blockchain scalability, and secure finance. However, authoring ZK programs remains challenging: unlike mainstream programming, ZK development requires reasoning about finite field arithmetic, constraint systems, and gadgets, making it knowledge-intensive and error-prone. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong code generation capabilities in general-purpose languages, their effectiveness for ZK programming, where correctness hinges on both language mastery and gadget-level reasoning, remains unexplored. To address this gap, we propose \textsc{ZK-Eval}, a domain-specific evaluation pipeline that probes LLM capabilities at three levels: language knowledge, gadget competence, and end-to-end program generation. Our evaluation of four state-of-the-art LLMs reveals that models excel at surface-level syntax but struggle with gadget usage and semantic correctness, often yielding incorrect programs. Based on these insights, we introduce \textsc{ZK-Coder}, an agentic framework that augments LLMs with constraint sketching, guided retrieval, and interactive repair. Experiments on Circom and Noir show substantial gains, with success rates improving from 17.35\% to 83.38\% and from 32.21\% to 90.05\%, respectively. With \textsc{ZK-Eval} and \textsc{ZK-Coder}, we establish a foundation for systematically measuring and augmenting LLMs in ZK code generation to lower barriers for practitioners and advance trustworthy computation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stencil-Lifting: Hierarchical Recursive Lifting System for Extracting Summary of Stencil Kernel in Legacy Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10236v2)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Stencil-Lifting, a novel system for automatically converting stencil kernels written in low-level languages in legacy code into semantically equivalent Domain-Specific Language (DSL) implementations. Targeting the efficiency bottlenecks of existing verified lifting systems, Stencil-Lifting achieves scalable stencil kernel abstraction through two key innovations. First, we propose a hierarchical recursive lifting theory that represents stencil kernels, structured as nested loops, using invariant subgraphs, which are customized data dependency graphs that capture loop-carried computation and structural invariants. Each vertex in the invariant subgraph is associated with a predicate-based summary, encoding its computational semantics. By enforcing self-consistency across these summaries, Stencil-Lifting ensures the derivation of correct loop invariants and postconditions for nested loops, eliminating the need for external verification. Second, we develop a hierarchical recursive lifting algorithm that guarantees termination through a convergent recursive process, avoiding the inefficiencies of search-based synthesis. The algorithm efficiently derives the valid summaries of stencil kernels, and its completeness is formally proven. We evaluate Stencil-Lifting on diverse stencil benchmarks from two different suites and on four real-world applications. Experimental results demonstrate that Stencil-Lifting achieves 31.62$\times$ and 5.8$\times$ speedups compared to the state-of-the-art verified lifting systems STNG and Dexter, respectively, while maintaining full semantic equivalence. Our work significantly enhances the translation efficiency of low-level stencil kernels to DSL implementations, effectively bridging the gap between legacy optimization techniques and modern DSL-based paradigms.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 12 figures.

Symbolic execution is a well-known method for analyzing programs and detecting various vulnerabilities, e.g., memory corruption. Although this method is sound and complete in theory, it faces some challenges, such as path explosion, when applied to real-world complex programs. In this paper, we present a method for improving the efficiency of symbolic execution and detecting four classes of memory corruption vulnerabilities in executable codes, i.e., heap-based buffer overflow, stack-based buffer overflow, use-after-free, and double-free. We perform symbolic execution only on test units rather than the whole program to lower the chance of path explosion. In our method, test units are considered parts of the program's code, which might contain vulnerable statements and are statically identified based on the specifications of memory corruption vulnerabilities. Then, each test unit is symbolically executed to calculate path and vulnerability constraints of each statement of the unit, which determine the conditions on unit input data for executing that statement or activating vulnerabilities in it, respectively. Solving these constraints gives us input values for the test unit, which execute the desired statements and reveal vulnerabilities in them. Finally, we use machine learning to approximate the correlation between system and unit input data. Thereby, we generate system inputs that enter the program, reach vulnerable instructions in the desired test unit, and reveal vulnerabilities in them. This method is implemented as a plugin for angr framework and evaluated using a group of benchmark programs. The experiments show its superiority over similar tools in accuracy and performance.</p></details> |  |

To bridge this gap, we introduce GitTaskBench, a benchmark designed to systematically assess this capability via 54 realistic tasks across 7 modalities and 7 domains. Each task pairs a relevant repository with an automated, human-curated evaluation harness specifying practical success criteria. Beyond measuring execution and task success, we also propose the alpha-value metric to quantify the economic benefit of agent performance, which integrates task success rates, token cost, and average developer salaries. Experiments across three state-of-the-art agent frameworks with multiple advanced LLMs show that leveraging code repositories for complex task solving remains challenging: even the best-performing system, OpenHands+Claude 3.7, solves only 48.15% of tasks (recent progress has pushed the frontier further, with RepoMaster+Claude 3.5 achieving a new record of 62.96%). Error analysis attributes over half of failures to seemingly mundane yet critical steps like environment setup and dependency resolution, highlighting the need for more robust workflow management and increased timeout preparedness. By releasing GitTaskBench, we aim to drive progress and attention toward repository-aware code reasoning, execution, and deployment -- moving agents closer to solving complex, end-to-end real-world tasks. The benchmark and code are open-sourced at https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/GitTaskBench.</p></details> | <details><summary>Highl...</summary><p>Highly practical, Well-motivated, Actionable</p></details> |

On one hand, low-latency code completion offers completion suggestions but is fundamentally constrained to the cursor's current position. On the other hand, chat-based editing can perform complex modifications, yet forces developers to stop their work, describe the intent in natural language, which causes a context-switch away from the code. This creates a suboptimal user experience, as neither paradigm proactively predicts the developer's next edit in a sequence of related edits. To bridge this gap and provide the seamless code edit suggestion, we introduce the task of Next Edit Prediction, a novel task designed to infer developer intent from recent interaction history to predict both the location and content of the subsequent edit. Specifically, we curate a high-quality supervised fine-tuning dataset and an evaluation benchmark for the Next Edit Prediction task. Then, we conduct supervised fine-tuning on a series of models and performed a comprehensive evaluation of both the fine-tuned models and other baseline models, yielding several novel findings. This work lays the foundation for a new interaction paradigm that proactively collaborate with developers by anticipating their following action, rather than merely reacting to explicit instructions.

| **[Beyond Autoregression: An Empirical Study of Diffusion Large Language Models for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11252v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have become the mainstream approaches to code generation. Existing LLMs mainly employ autoregressive generation, i.e. generating code token-by-token from left to right. However, the underlying autoregressive generation has two limitations in code generation. First, autoregressive LLMs only generate a token at each step, showing low efficiency in practice. Second, programming is a non-sequential process involving back-and-forth editing, while autoregressive LLMs only employ the left-to-right generation order. These two intrinsic limitations hinder the further development of LLMs in code generation. Recently, diffusion LLMs have emerged as a promising alternative. Diffusion LLMs address the above limitations with two advances, including multi-token prediction (i.e. generating multiple tokens at each step) and flexible generation order (i.e. flexibly determining which positions to generate tokens). However, there is no systematic study exploring diffusion LLMs in code generation. To bridge the knowledge gap, we present the first empirical study of diffusion LLMs for code generation. Our study involves 9 representative diffusion LLMs and conduct experiments on 4 widely used benchmarks. Based on the results, we summarize the following findings. (1) Existing diffusion LLMs are competitive with autoregressive LLMs with similar sizes. (2) Diffusion LLMs have a stronger length extrapolation ability than autoregressive LLMs and perform better in long code understanding. (3) We explore factors impacting the effectiveness and efficiency of diffusion LLMs, and provide practical guidance. (4) We discuss several promising further directions to improve diffusion LLMs on code generation. We open-source all source code, data, and results to facilitate the following research. The code is publicly available at https://github.com/zhangyitonggg/dllm4code.</p></details> |  |

While these methods have shown strong detection performance, they often struggle to sustain robustness in real-world settings, particularly when facing code obfuscation and adversarial examples (AEs). Deep multimodal learning has emerged as a promising solution, leveraging the strengths of multiple feature types to enhance robustness and generalization. However, a systematic investigation of multimodal fusion for both accuracy and resilience remains underexplored. In this study, we propose DMLDroid, an Android malware detection based on multimodal fusion that leverages three different representations of malware features, including permissions & intents (tabular-based), DEX file representations (image-based), and API calls (graph-derived sequence-based). We conduct exhaustive experiments independently on each feature, as well as in combination, using different fusion strategies. Experimental results on the CICMalDroid 2020 dataset demonstrate that our multimodal approach with the dynamic weighted fusion mechanism achieves high performance, reaching 97.98% accuracy and 98.67% F1-score on original malware detection. Notably, the proposed method maintains strong robustness, sustaining over 98% accuracy and 98% F1-score under both obfuscation and adversarial attack scenarios. Our findings highlight the benefits of multimodal fusion in improving both detection accuracy and robustness against evolving Android malware threats.</p></details> |  |

Traditional technology stack selection has not caught up. Most of the existing selection methods focus solely on the inherent attributes of the technology, overlooking whether the LLM can effectively leverage the chosen technology. For example, when generating code snippets using popular libraries like Selenium (one of the most widely used test automation tools with over 33k GitHub stars), existing LLMs frequently generate low-quality code snippets (e.g., using deprecated APIs and methods, or containing syntax errors). As such, teams using LLM assistants risk choosing technologies that cannot be used effectively by LLMs, yielding high debugging effort and mounting technical debt. We foresee a practical question in the LLM era, is a technology ready for AI-assisted development? In this paper, we first propose the concept, AI coding proficiency, the degree to which LLMs can utilize a given technology to generate high-quality code snippets. We conduct the first comprehensive empirical study examining AI proficiency across 170 third-party libraries and 61 task scenarios, evaluating six widely used LLMs. Our findings reveal that libraries with similar functionalities can exhibit up to 84% differences in the quality score of LLM-generated code, while different models also exhibit quality gaps among their generation results using the same library. These gaps translate into real engineering costs and can steer developer choices toward a narrow set of libraries with high AI coding proficiency, threatening technological diversity in the ecosystem. We call on the community to integrate AI proficiency assessments into technology selection frameworks and develop mitigation strategies, preserving competitive balance in AI-driven development.</p></details> | 23 pages |

Casting ranking as lossy source coding, we derive a single-letter rate-distortion function $R(D)$ for reciprocal-rank distortion and prove a converse bound that splits into a modality-balanced term plus a skew penalty $\kappa\,\Delta H$ capturing entropy imbalance and cross-modal redundancy. We then construct an explicit entropy-weighted stochastic quantizer with an adaptive, per-modality temperature decoder; a Blahut-Arimoto argument shows this scheme achieves distortion within $O(n^{-1})$ of $R(D)$ using $n$ training triples. A VC-type analysis yields the first finite-sample excess-risk bound whose complexity scales sub-linearly in both the number of modalities and the entropy gap. Experiments on controlled Gaussian mixtures and Flickr30k confirm that our adaptive codes sit within two percentage points of the theoretical frontier, while fixed-temperature and naive CLIP baselines lag significantly. Taken together, our results give a principled answer to "how many bits per query are necessary" for high-quality multimodal retrieval and provide design guidance for entropy-aware contrastive objectives, continual-learning retrievers, and retrieval-augmented generators.</p></details> | ICCV MRR 2025 |
| **[The Influence of Code Comments on the Perceived Helpfulness of Stack Overflow Posts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.19610v2)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Question-and-answer platforms such as Stack Overflow are an important way for software developers to share and retrieve knowledge. However, reusing poorly understood code can lead to serious problems, such as bugs or security vulnerabilities. To better understand how code comments affect the perceived helpfulness of Stack Overflow answers, we conducted an online experiment simulating a Stack Overflow environment (n=91). The results indicate that both block and inline comments are perceived as significantly more helpful than uncommented source code. Moreover, novices rated code snippets with block comments as more helpful than those with inline comments. Interestingly, other surface features, such as the position of an answer and its answer score, were considered less important. Moreover, the content of Stack Overflow has been a major source for training large language models. AI-based coding assistants such as GitHub Copilot, which are based on these models, are changing the way Stack Overflow is used. However, our findings have implications beyond Stack Overflow. First, they may help to improve the relevance also of other community-driven platforms, which provide human advice and explanations of code solutions, complementing AI-based support for software developers. Second, since chat-based AI tools can be prompted to generate code in different ways, knowing which properties influence perceived helpfulness can lead to more targeted prompting strategies to generate readable code snippets.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables, to appear in the Empirical Software Engineering journal</p></details> |
| **[When the Code Autopilot Breaks: Why LLMs Falter in Embedded Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10946v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate software generation in embedded machine learning workflows, yet their outputs often fail silently or behave unpredictably. This article presents an empirical investigation of failure modes in LLM-powered ML pipelines, based on an autopilot framework that orchestrates data preprocessing, model conversion, and on-device inference code generation. We show how prompt format, model behavior, and structural assumptions influence both success rates and failure characteristics, often in ways that standard validation pipelines fail to detect. Our analysis reveals a diverse set of error-prone behaviors, including format-induced misinterpretations and runtime-disruptive code that compiles but breaks downstream. We derive a taxonomy of failure categories and analyze errors across multiple LLMs, highlighting common root causes and systemic fragilities. Though grounded in specific devices, our study reveals broader challenges in LLM-based code generation. We conclude by discussing directions for improving reliability and traceability in LLM-powered embedded ML systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication in Computer (IEEE).

How Increasing AI Automation Transforms Developer Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.08149v2)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developers now have access to a growing array of increasingly autonomous AI tools for software development. While many studies examine copilots that provide chat assistance or code completions, evaluations of coding agents -- which can automatically write files and run code -- still rely on static benchmarks. We present the first controlled study of developer interactions with coding agents, characterizing how more autonomous AI tools affect productivity and experience. We evaluate two leading copilot and agentic coding assistants, recruiting participants who regularly use the former. Our results show agents can assist developers in ways that surpass copilots (e.g., completing tasks humans may not have accomplished) and reduce the effort required to finish tasks. Yet challenges remain for broader adoption, including ensuring users adequately understand agent behaviors. Our findings reveal how workflows shift with coding agents and how interactions differ from copilots, motivating recommendations for researchers and highlighting challenges in adopting agentic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uniquely-Decodable Coding for Zero-Error Network Function Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10775v1)** | 2025-09-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider uniquely-decodable coding for zero-error network function computation, where in a directed acyclic graph, the single sink node is required to compute with zero error a target function multiple times, whose arguments are the information sources generated at a set of source nodes. We are interested in the computing capacity from the information theoretic point of view, which is defined as the infimum of the maximum expected number of bits transmitted on all the edges for computing the target function once on average. We first prove some new results on clique entropy, in particular, the substitution lemma of clique entropy for probabilistic graphs with a certain condition. With them, we prove a lower bound on the computing capacity associated with clique entropies of the induced characteristic graphs, where the obtained lower bound is applicable to arbitrary network topologies, arbitrary information sources, and arbitrary target functions. By refining the probability distribution of information sources, we further strictly improve the obtained lower bound. In addition, we compare uniquely-decodable network function-computing coding and fixed-length network function-computing coding, and show that the former indeed outperforms the latter in terms of the computing capacity. Therein, we provide a novel graph-theoretic explanation of the key parameter in the best known bound on the computing capacity for fixed-length network function-computing codes, which would be helpful to improve the existing results.</p></details> | 49 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Multi-Agent Systems Execute Arbitrary Malicious Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12188v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems coordinate LLM-based agents to perform tasks on users' behalf. In real-world applications, multi-agent systems will inevitably interact with untrusted inputs, such as malicious Web content, files, email attachments, and more. Using several recently proposed multi-agent frameworks as concrete examples, we demonstrate that adversarial content can hijack control and communication within the system to invoke unsafe agents and functionalities. This results in a complete security breach, up to execution of arbitrary malicious code on the user's device or exfiltration of sensitive data from the user's containerized environment. For example, when agents are instantiated with GPT-4o, Web-based attacks successfully cause the multi-agent system execute arbitrary malicious code in 58-90\% of trials (depending on the orchestrator). In some model-orchestrator configurations, the attack success rate is 100\%. We also demonstrate that these attacks succeed even if individual agents are not susceptible to direct or indirect prompt injection, and even if they refuse to perform harmful actions. We hope that these results will motivate development of trust and security models for multi-agent systems before they are widely deployed.</p></details> | <details><summary>33 pa...</summary><p>33 pages, 5 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

Despite rapid adoption, little research has examined how vibe coding reconfigures UX workflows and collaboration. Drawing on interviews with 20 UX professionals across enterprises, startups, and academia, we show how vibe coding follows a four-stage workflow of ideation, AI generation, debugging, and review. This accelerates iteration, supports creativity, and lowers barriers to participation. However, professionals reported challenges of code unreliability, integration, and AI over-reliance. We find tensions between efficiency-driven prototyping ("intending the right design") and reflection ("designing the right intention"), introducing new asymmetries in trust, responsibility, and social stigma within teams. Through the lens of responsible human-AI collaboration for AI-assisted UX design and development, we contribute a deeper understanding of deskilling, ownership and disclosure, and creativity safeguarding in the age of vibe coding.</p></details> |  |

We introduce the quantum counterpart of those codes by defining quantum $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable codes which are quantum error-correcting codes capable of correcting $\delta -1$ qudit erasures from sets of at most $r+ \delta -1$ qudits. We give a necessary and sufficient condition for a quantum stabilizer code $Q(C)$ to be $(r,\delta)$-locally recoverable. Our condition depends only on the puncturing and shortening at suitable sets of both the symplectic self-orthogonal code $C$ used for constructing $Q(C)$ and its symplectic dual $C^{\perp_s}$. When $Q(C)$ comes from a Hermitian or Euclidean dual-containing code, and under an extra condition, we show that there is an equivalence between the classical and quantum concepts of $(r,\delta)$-local recoverability. A Singleton-like bound is stated in this case and examples attaining the bound are given.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages; AMSLaTeX; Proof of Lemma 15 is corrected, optimal quantum LRCs are called as optimal pure quantum LRCs, and some theorems are renumbered in version 2</p></details> |

Through matching converse and achievability bounds, we characterize the optimal first- and second-order performance. The main technical contribution of this paper is an achievability scheme which uses random codewords drawn from a mixture of three uniform distributions on $(n-1)$-spheres of radii $R_1, R_2$ and $R_3$, where $R_i = O(\sqrt{n})$ and $|R_i - R_j| = O(1)$. To analyze such a mixture distribution, we prove a lemma giving a uniform $O(\log n)$ bound, which holds with high probability, on the log ratio of the output distributions $Q_i^{cc}$ and $Q_j^{cc}$, where $Q_i^{cc}$ is induced by a random channel input uniformly distributed on an $(n-1)$-sphere of radius $R_i$. To facilitate the application of the usual central limit theorem, we also give a uniform $O(\log n)$ bound, which holds with high probability, on the log ratio of the output distributions $Q_i^{cc}$ and $Q^*_i$, where $Q_i^*$ is induced by a random channel input with i.i.d. components.</p></details> |  |

This framework comprises three specialized components: GuideLLM, a lightweight model deployed at the edge to provide methodological guidance; SolverLLM, a more powerful model hosted in the cloud responsible for generating code solutions; and JudgeLLM, an automated evaluator for assessing solution correctness and quality. To evaluate and demonstrate the effectiveness of this architecture in realistic settings, we introduce RefactorCoderQA, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate and enhance the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) across multi-domain coding tasks. Motivated by the limitations of existing benchmarks, RefactorCoderQA systematically covers various technical domains, including Software Engineering, Data Science, Machine Learning, and Natural Language Processing, using authentic coding challenges from Stack Overflow. Extensive experiments reveal that our fine-tuned model, RefactorCoder-MoE, achieves state-of-the-art performance, significantly outperforming leading open-source and commercial baselines with an overall accuracy of 76.84%. Human evaluations further validate the interpretability, accuracy, and practical relevance of the generated solutions. In addition, we evaluate system-level metrics, such as throughput and latency, to gain deeper insights into the performance characteristics and trade-offs of the proposed architecture.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, submitted to IEEE Transactions on Services Computing</p></details> |
| **[Developer-LLM Conversations: An Empirical Study of Interactions and Generated Code Quality](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10402v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are becoming integral to modern software development workflows, assisting developers with code generation, API explanation, and iterative problem-solving through natural language conversations. Despite widespread adoption, there is limited understanding of how developers interact with LLMs in practice and how these conversational dynamics influence task outcomes, code quality, and software engineering workflows. To address this, we leverage CodeChat, a large dataset comprising 82,845 real-world developer-LLM conversations, containing 368,506 code snippets generated across over 20 programming languages, derived from the WildChat dataset. We find that LLM responses are substantially longer than developer prompts, with a median token-length ratio of 14:1. Multi-turn conversations account for 68% of the dataset and often evolve due to shifting requirements, incomplete prompts, or clarification requests. Topic analysis identifies web design (9.6% of conversations) and neural network training (8.7% of conversations) as the most frequent LLM-assisted tasks. Evaluation across five languages (i.e., Python, JavaScript, C++, Java, and C#) reveals prevalent and language-specific issues in LLM-generated code: generated Python and JavaScript code often include undefined variables (83.4% and 75.3% of code snippets, respectively); Java code lacks required comments (75.9%); C++ code frequently omits headers (41.1%) and C# code shows unresolved namespaces (49.2%). During a conversation, syntax and import errors persist across turns; however, documentation quality in Java improves by up to 14.7%, and import handling in Python improves by 3.7% over 5 turns. Prompts that point out mistakes in code generated in prior turns and explicitly request a fix are most effective for resolving errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Near-Optimal Recovery Performance of PhaseLift for Phase Retrieval from Coded Diffraction Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10300v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The PhaseLift algorithm is an effective convex method for solving the phase retrieval problem from Fourier measurements with coded diffraction patterns (CDP). While exact reconstruction guarantees are well-established in the noiseless case, the stability of recovery under noise remains less well understood. In particular, when the measurements are corrupted by an additive noise vector $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb{R}^m$, existing recovery bounds scale on the order of $\|\mathbf{w}\|_2$, which is conjectured to be suboptimal. More recently, Soltanolkotabi conjectured that the optimal PhaseLift recovery bound should scale with the average noise magnitude, that is, on the order of $\|\mathbf{w}\|_2/\sqrt m$. However, establishing this theoretically is considerably more challenging and has remained an open problem. In this paper, we focus on this conjecture and provide a nearly optimal recovery bound for it. We prove that under adversarial noise, the recovery error of PhaseLift is bounded by $O(\log n \cdot \|\mathbf{w}\|_2/\sqrt m)$, and further show that there exists a noise vector for which the error lower bound exceeds $O\bigl(\frac{1}{\sqrt{\log n}} \cdot \frac{\|\mathbf{w}\|_2}{\sqrt m}\bigr)$. Here, $n$ is the dimension of the signals we aim to recover. Moreover, for mean-zero sub-Gaussian noise vector $\mathbf{w} \in \mathbb R^m$ with sub-Gaussian norm $\sigma$, we establish a bound of order $O\bigl(\sigma \sqrt{\frac{n \log^4 n}{m}}\bigr)$, and also provide a corresponding minimax lower bound. Our results affirm Soltanolkotabi's conjecture up to logarithmic factors, providing a new insight into the stability of PhaseLift under noisy CDP measurements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Symplectic Lattices and GKP Codes -- Simple Randomized Constructions from Cryptographic Lattices](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10183v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We construct good GKP (Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill) codes (in the sense of Conrad, Eisert and Seifert proposed) from standard short integer solution lattices (SIS) as well as from ring SIS and module SIS lattices, R-SIS and M-SIS lattices, respectively. These lattice are crucial for lattice-based cryptography. Our construction yields GKP codes with distance $\sqrt{n/\pi e}$. This compares favorably with the NTRU-based construction by Conrad et al. that achieves distance $\Omega(\sqrt{n/q}),$ with $n\le q^2/0.28$. Unlike their codes, our codes do not have secret keys that can be used to speed-up the decoding. However, we present a simple decoding algorithm that, for many parameter choices, experimentally yields decoding results similar to the ones for NTRU-based codes. Using the R-SIS and M-SIS construction, our simple decoding algorithm runs in nearly linear time. Following Conrad, Eisert and Seifert's work, our construction of GKP codes follows directly from an explicit, randomized construction of symplectic lattices with (up to constants $\approx 1$) minimal distance $(1/\sigma_{2n})^{1/2n}\approx \sqrt{\frac{n}{\pi e}}$, where $\sigma_{2n}$ is the volume of the 2n-dimensional unit ball. Before this result, Buser and Sarnak gave a non-constructive proof for the existence of such symplectic lattices.</p></details> | 41 pages, 3 figures |
| **[FGIT: Fault-Guided Fine-Tuning for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16913v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs) have made remarkable progress in code generation. However, these LLMs fine-tuned with standard supervised fine-tuning (SFT) sometimes generate plausible-looking but functionally incorrect code variants. This issue likely stems from the limitation of standard SFT, which treats all tokens equally during optimization and fails to emphasize the error-sensitive segments-specific code differences between correct implementations and similar incorrect variants. To address this problem, we propose Fault-Guided Fine-Tuning (FGIT), a novel fine-tuning technique that enhances LLMs' code generation by (1) extracting multi-granularity (line/token-level) differences between correct and incorrect yet similar implementations to identify error-sensitive segments, and (2) dynamically prioritizing those segments during training via dynamic loss weighting. Through extensive experiments on seven LLMs across three widely-used benchmarks, our method achieves an average relative improvement of 6.9% on pass@1 with some enhanced 6.7B LLMs outperforming closed-source models, e.g., GPT-3.5-Turbo. Furthermore, our fine-tuning technique demonstrates strong generalization with performance improvements ranging from 3.8% to 19.1% across diverse instruction-tuned LLMs, and our ablation studies confirm the contributions of different granularities of differences and hyperparameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Symmetry-Integrated Approach to Surface Code Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10164v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum error correction, which utilizes logical qubits that are encoded as redundant multiple physical qubits to find and correct errors in physical qubits, is indispensable for practical quantum computing. Surface code is considered to be a promising encoding method with a high error threshold that is defined by stabilizer generators. However, previous methods have suffered from the problem that the decoder acquires solely the error probability distribution because of the non-uniqueness of correct prediction obtained from the input. To circumvent this problem, we propose a technique to reoptimize the decoder model by approximating syndrome measurements with a continuous function that is mathematically interpolated by neural network. We evaluated the improvement in accuracy of a multilayer perceptron based decoder for code distances of 5 and 7 as well as for decoders based on convolutional and recurrent neural networks and transformers for a code distance of 5. In all cases, the reoptimized decoder gave better accuracy than the original models, demonstrating the universal effectiveness of the proposed method that is independent of code distance or network architecture. These results suggest that re-framing the problem of surface code decoding into a regression problem that can be tackled by deep learning is a useful strategy.</p></details> | 12 pages, 6 figures |

The rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption in development pipelines. Goal. We empirically assess the energy efficiency of Python code generated by LLMs against human-written code and code developed by a Green software expert. Method. We test 363 solutions to 9 coding problems from the EvoEval benchmark using 6 widespread LLMs with 4 prompting techniques, and comparing them to human-developed solutions. Energy consumption is measured on three different hardware platforms: a server, a PC, and a Raspberry Pi for a total of ~881h (36.7 days). Results. Human solutions are 16% more energy-efficient on the server and 3% on the Raspberry Pi, while LLMs outperform human developers by 25% on the PC. Prompting does not consistently lead to energy savings, where the most energy-efficient prompts vary by hardware platform. The code developed by a Green software expert is consistently more energy-efficient by at least 17% to 30% against all LLMs on all hardware platforms. Conclusions. Even though LLMs exhibit relatively good code generation capabilities, no LLM-generated code was more energy-efficient than that of an experienced Green software developer, suggesting that as of today there is still a great need of human expertise for developing energy-efficient Python code.</p></details> |  |

| **[Weighted Automata for Exact Inference in Discrete Probabilistic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15074v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In probabilistic programming, the inference problem asks to determine a program's posterior distribution conditioned on its "observe" instructions. Inference is challenging, especially when exact rather than approximate results are required. Inspired by recent work on probability generating functions (PGFs), we propose encoding distributions on $\mathbb{N}^k$ as weighted automata over a commutative alphabet with $k$ symbols. Based on this, we map the semantics of various imperative programming statements to automata-theoretic constructions. For a rich class of programs, this results in an effective translation from prior to posterior distribution, both encoded as automata. We prove that our approach is sound with respect to a standard operational program semantics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effort-Optimized, Accuracy-Driven Labelling and Validation of Test Inputs for DL Systems: A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04990v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software systems increasingly include AI components based on deep learning (DL). Reliable testing of such systems requires near-perfect test-input validity and label accuracy, with minimal human effort. Yet, the DL community has largely overlooked the need to build highly accurate datasets with minimal effort, since DL training is generally tolerant of labelling errors. This challenge, instead, reflects concerns more familiar to software engineering, where a central goal is to construct high-accuracy test inputs, with accuracy as close to 100% as possible, while keeping associated costs in check. In this article we introduce OPAL, a human-assisted labelling method that can be configured to target a desired accuracy level while minimizing the manual effort required for labelling. The main contribution of OPAL is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that minimizes labelling effort subject to a specified accuracy target. To evaluate OPAL we instantiate it for two tasks in the context of testing vision systems: automatic labelling of test inputs and automated validation of test inputs. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on seven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL, relying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, while cutting manual labelling by more than half. OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in labelling accuracy across all seven datasets, when all methods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated test-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while achieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA test-input validation baselines. Finally, we show that augmenting OPAL with an active-learning loop leads to an additional 4.5% reduction in required manual labelling, without compromising accuracy.</p></details> |  |

We focus on universal PPs featuring sampling from arbitrary measures and conditioning/reweighting in unbounded loops. We first equip Probabilistic Program Graphs (PPGs), an automata-theoretic description format of PPs, with an expectation-based semantics over infinite execution traces, which also incorporates trace weights. We then prove a finite approximation theorem that provides bounds to this semantics based on expectations taken over finite, fixed-length traces. This enables us to frame our semantics within a Feynman-Kac (FK) model, and ensures the consistency of the Particle Filtering (PF) algorithm, an instance of SMC, with respect to our semantics. Building on these results, we introduce VPF, a vectorized version of the PF algorithm tailored to PPGs and our semantics. Experiments conducted with a proof-of-concept implementation of VPF show very promising results compared to state-of-the-art PP inference tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings GandALF 2025, arXiv:2509.13258</p></details> |
| **[Interleaving Natural Language Prompting with Code Editing for Solving Programming Tasks with Generative AI Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14088v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, computing students often rely on both natural-language prompting and manual code editing to solve programming tasks. Yet we still lack a clear understanding of how these two modes are combined in practice, and how their usage varies with task complexity and student ability. In this paper, we investigate this through a large-scale study in an introductory programming course, collecting 13,305 interactions from 355 students during a three-day laboratory activity. Our analysis shows that students primarily use prompting to generate initial solutions, and then often enter short edit-run loops to refine their code following a failed execution. We find that manual editing becomes more frequent as task complexity increases, but most edits remain concise, with many affecting a single line of code. Higher-performing students tend to succeed using prompting alone, while lower-performing students rely more on edits. Student reflections confirm that prompting is helpful for structuring solutions, editing is effective for making targeted corrections, while both are useful for learning. These findings highlight the role of manual editing as a deliberate last-mile repair strategy, complementing prompting in AI-assisted programming workflows.</p></details> |  |

Task and motion planning (TAMP) addresses this by combining symbolic planning and continuous trajectory generation. Recently, foundation model approaches to TAMP have presented impressive results, including fast planning times and the execution of natural language instructions. Yet, the optimal interface between high-level planning and low-level motion generation remains an open question: prior approaches are limited by either too much abstraction (e.g., chaining simplified skill primitives) or a lack thereof (e.g., direct joint angle prediction). Our method introduces a novel technique employing a form of meta-optimization to address these issues by: (i) using program search over trajectory optimization problems as an interface between a foundation model and robot control, and (ii) leveraging a zero-order method to optimize numerical parameters in the foundation model output. Results on challenging object manipulation and drawing tasks confirm that our proposed method improves over prior TAMP approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages main text, 11 pages appendix, accepted at the 9th Annual Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2025)</p></details> |

This course is offered to undergraduate and graduate students during Fall 2024 and Spring 2025. The course began with foundational concepts in GPU/CPU hardware and parallel computing and progressed to develop RAG and optimizing them using GPUs. Students gained experience provisioning and configuring cloud-based GPU instances, implementing parallel algorithms, and deploying scalable AI solutions. We evaluated learning outcomes through assessments, course evaluations, and anonymous surveys. The results reveal that (1) AWS served as an effective and economical platform for practical GPU programming, (2) experiential learning significantly enhanced technical proficiency and engagement, and (3) the course strengthened students' problem-solving and critical thinking skills through tools such as TensorBoard and HPC profilers, which exposed performance bottlenecks and scaling issues. Our findings underscore the pedagogical value of integrating parallel computing into STEM education. We advocate for broader adoption of similar electives across STEM curricula to prepare students for the demands of modern, compute-intensive fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Reactive Grasping via Task-Space Velocity Fields and Joint-Space Quadratic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01044v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a fast and reactive grasping framework that combines task-space velocity fields with joint-space Quadratic Program (QP) in a hierarchical structure. Reactive, collision-free global motion planning is particularly challenging for high-DoF systems, as simultaneous increases in state dimensionality and planning horizon trigger a combinatorial explosion of the search space, making real-time planning intractable. To address this, we plan globally in a lower-dimensional task space, such as fingertip positions, and track locally in the full joint space while enforcing all constraints. This approach is realized by constructing velocity fields in multiple task-space coordinates (or, in some cases, a subset of joint coordinates) and solving a weighted joint-space QP to compute joint velocities that track these fields with appropriately assigned priorities. Through simulation experiments and real-world tests using the recent pose-tracking algorithm FoundationPose, we verify that our method enables high-DoF arm-hand systems to perform real-time, collision-free reaching motions while adapting to dynamic environments and external disturbances.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 12 figures, under review</p></details> |

| **[Trajectory Tracking with Reachability-Guided Quadratic Programming and Freeze-Resume](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13501v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many robotic systems must follow planned paths yet pause safely and resume when people or objects intervene. We present an output-space method for systems whose tracked output can be feedback-linearized to a double integrator (e.g., manipulators). The approach has two parts. Offline, we perform a pre-run reachability check to verify that the motion plan respects speed and acceleration magnitude limits. Online, we apply a quadratic program to track the motion plan under the same limits. We use a one-step reachability test to bound the maximum disturbance the system is capable of rejecting. When the state coincides with the reference path we recover perfect tracking in the deterministic case, and we correct errors using a KKT-inspired weight. We demonstrate that safety stops and unplanned deviations are handled efficiently, and the system returns to the motion plan without replanning. We demonstrate our system's improved performance over pure pursuit in simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolution of Programmers' Trust in Generative AI Programming Assistants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13253v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivation. Trust in generative AI programming assistants is a vital attitude that impacts how programmers use those programming assistants. Programmers that are over-trusting may be too reliant on their tools, leading to incorrect or vulnerable code; programmers that are under-trusting may avoid using tools that can improve their productivity and well-being. Methods. Since trust is a dynamic attitude that may change over time, this study aims to understand programmers' evolution of trust after immediate (one hour) and extended (10 days) use of GitHub Copilot. We collected survey data from 71 upper-division computer science students working on a legacy code base, representing a population that is about to enter the workforce. In this study, we quantitatively measure student trust levels and qualitatively uncover why student trust changes. Findings. Student trust, on average, increased over time. After completing a project with Copilot, however, students felt that Copilot requires a competent programmer to complete some tasks manually. Students mentioned that seeing Copilot's correctness, understanding how Copilot uses context from the code base, and learning some basics of natural language processing contributed to their elevated trust. Implications. Our study helps instructors and industry managers understand the factors that influence how students calibrate their trust with AI assistants. We make four pedagogical recommendations, which are that CS educators should 1) provide opportunities for students to work with Copilot on challenging software engineering tasks to calibrate their trust, 2) teach traditional skills of comprehending, debugging, and testing so students can verify output, 3) teach students about the basics of natural language processing, and 4) explicitly introduce and demonstrate the range of features available in Copilot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Koli ...</summary><p>Koli Calling 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[A Linear Programming Framework for Optimal Event-Triggered LQG Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10671v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This letter explores intelligent scheduling of sensor-to-controller communication in networked control systems, particularly when data transmission incurs a cost. While the optimal controller in a standard linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) setup can be computed analytically, determining the optimal times to transmit sensor data remains computationally and analytically challenging. We show that, through reformulation and the introduction of auxiliary binary variables, the scheduling problem can be cast as a computationally efficient mixed-integer linear program (MILP). This formulation not only simplifies the analysis but also reveals structural insights and provides clear decision criteria at each step. Embedding the approach within a model predictive control (MPC) framework enables dynamic adaptation, and we prove that the resulting scheduler performs at least as well as any deterministic strategy (e.g., periodic strategy). Simulation results further demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms traditional periodic scheduling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pleasant Imperative Program Proofs with GallinaC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13019v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Even with the increase of popularity of functional programming, imperative programming remains a key programming paradigm, especially for programs operating at lower levels of abstraction. When such software offers key components of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB), e.g. an operating system kernel, it becomes desirable to provide mathematical correctness proofs. However, current real-world imperative programming languages possess "expressive", i.e. overly permissive, semantics. Thus, producing correctness proofs of such programs becomes tedious and error-prone, requiring to take care of numerous "administrative" details. Ideally, a proof-oriented imperative language should feature well-behaved semantics while allowing imperative idioms. To obtain a high-degree of confidence in the correctness of such a language, its tools should be developed inside a proof-assistant such that program proofs are machine checked. We present GallinaC, a shallow embedding of a Turing-complete imperative language directly inside the functional programming language of the Rocq proof assistant, Gallina. In particular, it features a truly generic and unbounded while loop. Having a functional core means proofs about GallinaC programs may use the same tactics as proofs about pure functional ones. Work on GallinaC is still under progress, but we present first promising results. A prototype implementation has shown the viability of GallinaC with the correctness proof of a list reversal procedure for linked-lists of unknown size. We currently focus on the forward simulation between the GallinaC intermediate representation (IR) and Cminor, the entry language of the CompCert back-end.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings FROM 2025, arXiv:2509.11877</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Compilation of Algorithms into Compact Linear Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13006v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear Programming (LP) is widely applied in industry and is a key component of various other mathematical problem-solving techniques. Recent work introduced an LP compiler translating polynomial-time, polynomial-space algorithms into polynomial-size LPs using intuitive high-level programming languages, offering a promising alternative to manually specifying each set of constraints through Algebraic Modeling Languages (AMLs). However, the resulting LPs, while polynomial in size, are often extremely large, posing challenges for existing LP solvers. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for generating substantially smaller LPs from algorithms. Our goal is to establish minimum-size compact LP formulations for problems in P having natural formulations with exponential extension complexities. Our broader vision is to enable the systematic generation of Compact Integer Programming (CIP) formulations for problems with exponential-size IPs having polynomial-time separation oracles. To this end, we introduce a hierarchical linear pipelining technique that decomposes nested program structures into synchronized regions with well-defined execution transitions -- functions of compile-time parameters. This decomposition allows us to localize LP constraints and variables within each region, significantly reducing LP size without the loss of generality, ensuring the resulting LP remains valid for all inputs of size $n$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two benchmark problems -- the makespan problem, which has exponential extension complexity, and the weighted minimum spanning tree problem -- both of which have exponential-size natural LPs. Our results show up to a $25$-fold reduction in LP size and substantial improvements in solver performance across both commercial and non-commercial LP solvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version will appear in CASCON 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Automated Loop Invariant Generation for Complex Programs with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10483v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program verification has always been an important component of building trustworthy software. While the analysis of real-world programs remains a theoretical challenge, the automation of loop invariant analysis has effectively resolved the problem. However, real-world programs that often mix complex data structures and control flows pose challenges to traditional loop invariant generation tools. To enhance the applicability of invariant generation techniques, we proposed ACInv, an Automated Complex program loop Invariant generation tool, which combines static analysis with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate the proper loop invariants. We utilize static analysis to extract the necessary information for each loop and embed it into prompts for the LLM to generate invariants for each loop. Subsequently, we employ an LLM-based evaluator to assess the generated invariants, refining them by either strengthening, weakening, or rejecting them based on their correctness, ultimately obtaining enhanced invariants. We conducted experiments on ACInv, which showed that ACInv outperformed previous tools on data sets with data structures, and maintained similar performance to the state-of-the-art tool AutoSpec on numerical programs without data structures. For the total data set, ACInv can solve 21% more examples than AutoSpec and can generate reference data structure templates.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 figures |
| **[MTP: A Meaning-Typed Language Abstraction for AI-Integrated Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08965v6)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software development is shifting from traditional programming to AI-integrated applications that leverage generative AI and large language models (LLMs) during runtime. However, integrating LLMs remains complex, requiring developers to manually craft prompts and process outputs. Existing tools attempt to assist with prompt engineering, but often introduce additional complexity. This paper presents Meaning-Typed Programming (MTP), a novel paradigm that abstracts LLM integration through intuitive language-level constructs. By leveraging the inherent semantic richness of code, MTP automates prompt generation and response handling without additional developer effort. We introduce the (1) by operator for seamless LLM invocation, (2) MT-IR, a meaning-based intermediate representation for semantic extraction, and (3) MT-Runtime, an automated system for managing LLM interactions. We implement MTP in Jac, a programming language that supersets Python, and find that MTP significantly reduces coding complexity while maintaining accuracy and efficiency. MTP significantly reduces development complexity, lines of code modifications needed, and costs while improving run-time performance and maintaining or exceeding the accuracy of existing approaches. Our user study shows that developers using MTP completed tasks 3.2x faster with 45% fewer lines of code compared to existing frameworks. Moreover, MTP demonstrates resilience even when up to 50% of naming conventions are degraded, demonstrating robustness to suboptimal code. MTP is developed as part of the Jaseci open-source project, and is available under the module byLLM.</p></details> | OOPSLA 2025 |

Unlike conventional code generation, these agents decompose goals, coordinate multi-step processes, and adapt based on feedback, reshaping software development practices. This survey provides a timely review of the field, introducing a taxonomy of agent behaviors and system architectures and examining relevant techniques for planning, context management, tool integration, execution monitoring, and benchmarking datasets. We highlight challenges of this fast-moving field and discuss opportunities for building reliable, transparent, and collaborative coding agents.</p></details> |  |

| **[Optimal Micro-Transit Zoning via Clique Generation and Integer Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11445v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Micro-transit services offer a promising solution to enhance urban mobility and access, particularly by complementing existing public transit. However, effectively designing these services requires determining optimal service zones for these on-demand shuttles, a complex challenge often constrained by operating budgets and transit agency priorities. This paper presents a novel two-phase algorithmic framework for designing optimal micro-transit service zones based on the objective of maximizing served demand. A key innovation is our adaptation of the shareability graph concept from its traditional use in dynamic trip assignment to the distinct challenge of static spatial zoning. We redefine shareability by considering geographical proximity within a specified diameter constraint, rather than trip characteristics. In Phase 1, the framework employs a highly scalable algorithm to generate a comprehensive set of candidate zones. In Phase 2, it formulates the selection of a specified number of zones as a Weighted Maximum Coverage Problem, which can be efficiently solved by an integer programming solver. Evaluations on real-world data from Chattanooga, TN, and synthetic datasets show that our framework outperforms a baseline algorithm, serving 27.03% more demand in practice and up to 49.5% more demand in synthetic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at IEEE ITSC 2025 (International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems)</p></details> |
| **[On Closure Properties of Read-Once Oblivious Algebraic Branching Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10725v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the closure properties of read-once oblivious Algebraic Branching Programs (roABPs) under various natural algebraic operations and prove the following. - Non-closure under factoring: There is a sequence of explicit polynomials $(f_n(x_1,\ldots, x_n))_n$ that have $\mathsf{poly}(n)$-sized roABPs such that some irreducible factor of $f_n$ does not have roABPs of superpolynomial size in any order. - Non-closure under powering: There is a sequence of polynomials $(f_n(x_1,\ldots, x_n))_n$ with $\mathsf{poly}(n)$-sized roABPs such that any super-constant power of $f_n$ does not have roABPs of polynomial size in any order (and $f_n^n$ requires exponential size in any order). - Non-closure under symmetric compositions: There are symmetric polynomials $(f_n(e_1,\ldots, e_n))_n$ that have roABPs of polynomial size such that $f_n(x_1,\ldots, x_n)$ do not have roABPs of subexponential size. (Here, $e_1,\ldots, e_n$ denote the elementary symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables.) These results should be viewed in light of known results on models such as algebraic circuits, (general) algebraic branching programs, formulas and constant-depth circuits, all of which are known to be closed under these operations. To prove non-closure under factoring, we construct hard polynomials based on expander graphs using gadgets that lift their hardness from sparse polynomials to roABPs. For symmetric compositions, we show that the circulant polynomial requires roABPs of exponential size in every variable order.</p></details> | 25 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Automating the Derivation of Unification Algorithms: A Case Study in Deductive Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11136v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The unification algorithm has long been a target for program synthesis research, but a fully automatic derivation remains a research goal. In deductive program synthesis, computer programming is phrased as a task in theorem proving; a declarative specification is expressed in logical form and presented to an automatic theorem prover, and a program meeting the specification is extracted from the proof. The correctness of the program is supported by the proof, which also provides an explanation of how the program works. The proof is conducted in an appropriate axiomatic subject-domain theory, which defines the concepts in the specification and the constructs in the target programming language and provides the background knowledge necessary to connect them. For the unification proof, we generalize and automate the manual proof presented in Manna and Waldinger [1981]. The new program unifies two given symbolic expressions (s-expressions) relative to a given "environment" substitution. The proof establishes the existence of an output substitution that is a most-general idempotent unifier of the given expressions and is an "extension" of the environment substitution. If no such substitution exists and the expressions are not unifiable, the program is to produce a failure indicator. Initially the environment substitution is the empty substitution, which makes no replacements at all; during execution of recursive calls, the environment substitution records the replacements that have been found so far. Our own unification algorithm employs an environment, and such algorithms appear in the literature [e.g., Luger and Stubblefield, 1997]. We suspect, in addition to being more efficient, the three-argument algorithm with an environment is easier to synthesize automatically than the two-argument version from the Manna-Waldinger paper.</p></details> | 92 pages |
| **[Humanizing Automated Programming Feedback: Fine-Tuning Generative Models with Student-Written Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10647v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing need for automated and personalized feedback in programming education has led to recent interest in leveraging generative AI for feedback generation. However, current approaches tend to rely on prompt engineering techniques in which predefined prompts guide the AI to generate feedback. This can result in rigid and constrained responses that fail to accommodate the diverse needs of students and do not reflect the style of human-written feedback from tutors or peers. In this study, we explore learnersourcing as a means to fine-tune language models for generating feedback that is more similar to that written by humans, particularly peer students. Specifically, we asked students to act in the flipped role of a tutor and write feedback on programs containing bugs. We collected approximately 1,900 instances of student-written feedback on multiple programming problems and buggy programs. To establish a baseline for comparison, we analyzed a sample of 300 instances based on correctness, length, and how the bugs are described. Using this data, we fine-tuned open-access generative models, specifically Llama3 and Phi3. Our findings indicate that fine-tuning models on learnersourced data not only produces feedback that better matches the style of feedback written by students, but also improves accuracy compared to feedback generated through prompt engineering alone, even though some student-written feedback is incorrect. This surprising finding highlights the potential of student-centered fine-tuning to improve automated feedback systems in programming education.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM) 2025</p></details> |

Yet, little is known about how novices interact with GenAI tools and their feedback quality in the form of audio output. This paper analyzes audio dialogues from nine 9th-grade students using a voice-enabled tutor (powered by OpenAI's Realtime API) in an authentic classroom setting while learning Python. We examined the students' voice prompts and AI's responses (1210 messages) by using qualitative coding. We also gathered students' perceptions via the Partner Modeling Questionnaire. The GenAI Voice Tutor primarily offered feedback on mistakes and next steps, but its correctness was limited (71.4% correct out of 416 feedback outputs). Quality issues were observed, particularly when the AI attempted to utter programming code elements. Students used the GenAI voice tutor primarily for debugging. They perceived it as competent, only somewhat human-like, and flexible. The present study is the first to explore the interaction dynamics of real-time voice GenAI tutors and novice programmers, informing future educational tool design and potentially addressing accessibility needs of diverse learners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the 25th International Conference on Computing Education Research (Koli Calling '25)</p></details> |
| **[Prompt Programming: A Platform for Dialogue-based Computational Problem Solving with Generative AI Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04267v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing students increasingly rely on generative AI tools for programming assistance, often without formal instruction or guidance. This highlights a need to teach students how to effectively interact with AI models, particularly through natural language prompts, to generate and critically evaluate code for solving computational tasks. To address this, we developed a novel platform for prompt programming that enables authentic dialogue-based interactions, supports problems involving multiple interdependent functions, and offers on-request execution of generated code. Data analysis from over 900 students in an introductory programming course revealed high engagement, with the majority of prompts occurring within multi-turn dialogues. Problems with multiple interdependent functions encouraged iterative refinement, with progression graphs highlighting several common strategies. Students were highly selective about the code they chose to test, suggesting that on-request execution of generated code promoted critical thinking. Given the growing importance of learning dialogue-based programming with AI, we provide this tool as a publicly accessible resource, accompanied by a corpus of programming problems for educational use.</p></details> | ITiCSE'25 paper |

However, existing LLM-based approaches often struggle with programs that include complex loop structures, leading to irrelevant specifications. Moreover, the rigorous proof obligations and design constraints imposed by verification tools can further result in incomplete and ambiguous specifications. To address these challenges, we propose SLD-Spec, an LLM-assisted specification generation method tailored for programs with complex loop constructs. SLD-Spec introduces two novel phases into the traditional specification generation framework: (1) A slicing phase, which decomposes each function into code fragments containing independent loop structures, thereby reducing the complexity of specification generation; and (2) A logical deletion phase, which applies LLM-based reasoning to filter out incorrect candidate specifications--especially those not easily identified by verification tool--while retaining valid ones. Experimental results show that on the simple dataset, SLD-Spec successfully verifies five more programs than the state-of-the-art AutoSpec and reduces runtime by 23.73%. To address the limitations of existing research, we manually construct a dataset comprising four categories of complex loop programs. On this dataset, SLD-Spec significantly improves the correctness, relevance, and completeness of generated specifications compared to baseline methods, enabling 95.1% of assertions and 90.91% of programs to pass verification. Ablation studies further reveal that logical deletion is critical for enhancing specification correctness and relevance, while program slicing contributes significantly to specification completeness. Our code and data are publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 2 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[On Integrating Large Language Models and Scenario-Based Programming for Improving Software Reliability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09194v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are fast becoming indispensable tools for software developers, assisting or even partnering with them in crafting complex programs. The advantages are evident -- LLMs can significantly reduce development time, generate well-organized and comprehensible code, and occasionally suggest innovative ideas that developers might not conceive on their own. However, despite their strengths, LLMs will often introduce significant errors and present incorrect code with persuasive confidence, potentially misleading developers into accepting flawed solutions. In order to bring LLMs into the software development cycle in a more reliable manner, we propose a methodology for combining them with ``traditional'' software engineering techniques in a structured way, with the goal of streamlining the development process, reducing errors, and enabling users to verify crucial program properties with increased confidence. Specifically, we focus on the Scenario-Based Programming (SBP) paradigm -- an event-driven, scenario-based approach for software engineering -- to allow human developers to pour their expert knowledge into the LLM, as well as to inspect and verify its outputs. To evaluate our methodology, we conducted a significant case study, and used it to design and implement the Connect4 game. By combining LLMs and SBP we were able to create a highly-capable agent, which could defeat various strong existing agents. Further, in some cases, we were able to formally verify the correctness of our agent. Finally, our experience reveals interesting insights regarding the ease-of-use of our proposed approach. The full code of our case-study will be made publicly available with the final version of this paper.</p></details> |  |

While performance is critical, we also need to ensure that these optimizations are correct. In this paper, we focus on a specific class of optimizations, floating-point optimizations, notably due to fast math, at the LLVM IR level. We present a preliminary work, which leverages the Verified LLVM framework in the Rocq theorem prover, to prove the correctness of Fused-Multiply-Add (FMA) optimization for a basic block implementing the arithmetic expression $a * b + c$ . We then propose ways to extend this preliminary results by adding more program features and fast math floating-point optimizations.</p></details> |  |

Assertions allow expressing partial program specifications, which can be verified either at compile time (statically) or run time (dynamically). In higher-order programs, assertions can also describe higher-order arguments. While in the context of (constraint) logic programming ((C)LP), run-time verification of higher-order assertions has received some attention, compile-time verification remains relatively unexplored. We propose a novel approach for statically verifying higher-order (C)LP programs with higher-order assertions. Although we use the Ciao assertion language for illustration, our approach is quite general and we believe is applicable to similar contexts. Higher-order arguments are described using predicate properties -- a special kind of property which exploits the (Ciao) assertion language. We refine the syntax and semantics of these properties and introduce an abstract criterion to determine conformance to a predicate property at compile time, based on a semantic order relation comparing the predicate property with the predicate assertions. We then show how to handle these properties using an abstract interpretation-based static analyzer for programs with first-order assertions by reducing predicate properties to first-order properties. Finally, we report on a prototype implementation and evaluate it through various examples within the Ciao system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)</p></details> |

Existing solutions often require additional context, expensive SMT solvers, or manual intervention to approximate these functions through symbolic stubs. In this work, we propose a novel approach to automatically generate symbolic stubs for external functions during symbolic execution that leverages Genetic Programming. When the symbolic executor encounters an external function, AutoStub generates training data by executing the function on randomly generated inputs and collecting the outputs. Genetic Programming then derives expressions that approximate the behavior of the function, serving as symbolic stubs. These automatically generated stubs allow the symbolic executor to continue the analysis without manual intervention, enabling the exploration of program paths that were previously intractable. We demonstrate that AutoStub can automatically approximate external functions with over 90% accuracy for 55% of the functions evaluated, and can infer language-specific behaviors that reveal edge cases crucial for software testing.</p></details> | 2025 HUMIES finalist |

However, the complexity of modeling languages, the large number of global constraints, and the art of creating good models have often hindered non-experts from choosing CP to solve their combinatorial problems. While generating an expert-level model from a natural-language description of a problem would be the dream, we are not yet there. We propose a tutoring system called CP-Model-Zoo, exploiting expert-written models accumulated through the years. CP-Model-Zoo retrieves the closest source code model from a database based on a user's natural language description of a combinatorial problem. It ensures that expert-validated models are presented to the user while eliminating the need for human data labeling. Our experiments show excellent accuracy in retrieving the correct model based on a user-input description of a problem simulated with different levels of expertise.</p></details> | <details><summary>prese...</summary><p>presented at"LLMs meet Constraint Solving" Workshop at CP2025 in Glasgow</p></details> |

As a computationally affordable method for resolving the extended problem, we present a revised version of the differential dynamic programming (DDP), termed the differential dynamic programming with ellipsoidal target set (ETS-DDP). To this end, the problem with an ellipsoidal target set is reformulated into an equivalent form with the orthogonal projection operator, yielding that the resulting cost functions turn out to be discontinuous at some points. As the DDP usually requires the differentiability of cost functions, in the ETS-DDP formulation we locally approximate the (nonsmooth) cost functions to smoothed ones near the path generated at the previous iteration, by utilizing the explicit form of the orthogonal projection operator. Moreover, a statistical inference method is also presented for designing the ellipsoidal target set, based on data on admissible target points collected by expert demonstrations. Via a simulation on autonomous parking of a vehicle, it is seen that the proposed ETS-DDP efficiently derives an admissible state trajectory while running much faster than the point-targeted DDP, at the expense of optimality.</p></details> | <details><summary>25th ...</summary><p>25th International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS)</p></details> |

Traditional Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) often intertwines security logic with business functionality, leading to code tangling, scattering, and reduced maintainability. This study investigates the role of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in enhancing secure software development by modularizing cross-cutting security concerns. Using a case study approach, we compare AOP-based implementations of security features including authentication, authorization, input validation, encryption, logging, and session management with conventional OOP or middleware-based approaches. Data collection involves analyzing code quality metrics (e.g., lines of code, coupling, cohesion, modularity index, reusability), performance metrics (response time, throughput, memory usage), and maintainability indicators. Developer feedback is also incorporated to assess integration and debugging experiences. Statistical methods, guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 software quality model, are applied to evaluate differences across implementations. The findings demonstrate that AOP enhances modularity, reusability, and maintainability of security mechanisms, while introducing only minimal performance overhead. The study contributes practical insights for software engineers and researchers seeking to balance security with software quality in web application development.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

Although regularized methods offer convergence guarantees under minimal assumptions on the problem data, they can exhibit the slow tail-convergence typical of first-order schemes, thus requiring many iterations to achieve high-accuracy solutions. Moreover, hyperparameter tuning significantly impacts on the solver performance but how to find an appropriate parameter configuration remains an elusive research question. To address these issues, we explore how data-driven approaches can accelerate the solution process. Aiming at high-accuracy solutions, we focus on a stabilized interior-point solver and carefully handle its two-loop flow and control parameters. We will show that reinforcement learning can make a significant contribution to facilitating the solver tuning and to speeding up the optimization process. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, after a lightweight training, the learned policy generalizes well to different problem classes with varying dimensions and to various solver configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Specification-Guided Repair of Arithmetic Errors in Dafny Programs using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03659v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging and repairing faults when programs fail to formally verify can be complex and time-consuming. Automated Program Repair (APR) can ease this burden by automatically identifying and fixing faults. However, traditional APR techniques often rely on test suites for validation, but these may not capture all possible scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide strong correctness criteria, enabling more effective automated repair. In this paper, we present an APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare logic to determine the state of each statement within the program, and applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The models considered are GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% fault localization coverage and GPT-4o mini yields the highest repair success rate of 74.18%. These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-based program synthesis for automated program repair.</p></details> |  |

Exploring and Evaluating the Design and Trade-offs of Proactive AI Programming Support](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18658v4)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI programming tools enable powerful code generation, and recent prototypes attempt to reduce user effort with proactive AI agents, but their impact on programming workflows remains unexplored. We introduce and evaluate Codellaborator, a design probe LLM agent that initiates programming assistance based on editor activities and task context. We explored three interface variants to assess trade-offs between increasingly salient AI support: prompt-only, proactive agent, and proactive agent with presence and context (Codellaborator). In a within-subject study (N=18), we find that proactive agents increase efficiency compared to prompt-only paradigm, but also incur workflow disruptions. However, presence indicators and interaction context support alleviated disruptions and improved users' awareness of AI processes. We underscore trade-offs of Codellaborator on user control, ownership, and code understanding, emphasizing the need to adapt proactivity to programming processes. Our research contributes to the design exploration and evaluation of proactive AI systems, presenting design implications on AI-integrated programming workflow.</p></details> |  |

While modern dataflow accelerators incorporate on-chip streaming to mitigate off-chip bandwidth limitations, existing programming models struggle to harness these capabilities effectively. Low-level interfaces provide fine-grained control but impose significant development overhead, whereas high-level tile-based languages abstract away communication details, restricting optimization and forcing compilers to reconstruct the intended dataflow. We present Dato, a Python-embedded, task-based programming model for dataflow accelerators that elevates data communication and sharding to first-class type constructs. Developers write programs as a graph of tasks connected via explicit stream types, with sharded inputs specified using layout types. These tasks are first mapped virtually onto the accelerator's spatial fabric, and the compiler then generates a physical mapping that respects hardware constraints. Experimental results on both AMD Ryzen AI NPU and Alveo FPGA devices demonstrate that Dato achieves high performance while significantly reducing the burden of writing optimized code. On the NPU, Dato attains up to 84% hardware utilization for GEMM and delivers a 2.81x speedup on attention kernels compared to a state-of-the-art commercial framework. On the FPGA, Dato surpasses leading frameworks in performance when generating custom systolic arrays, achieving 98% of the theoretical peak performance.</p></details> |  |

This subarea of program analysis is challenging due to the existence of undecidable problems, and this Survey systematically explores approaches that mitigate this inherent difficulty. These include foundational decidability results, the use of ranking functions, and disjunctive well-founded transition invariants. The Survey also discusses non-termination witnesses, used to prove that a program will not halt. We examine the algorithmic and complexity aspects of these methods, showing how different approaches offer a trade-off between expressive power and computational complexity. The Survey does not discuss how termination analysis is performed on real-world programming languages, nor does it consider more expressive abstract models that include non-linear arithmetic, probabilistic choice, or term rewriting systems.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we explore using Large Language Models (LLMs), and in particular, their abilities of doing in-context learning, for conversational code generation. As a first step, we define RATS, the ``Repetitive Assembly Task'', a 2D building task designed to lay the foundation for simulating industry assembly scenarios. In this task, a `programmer' instructs a cobot, using natural language, on how a certain assembly is to be built; that is, the programmer induces a program, through natural language. We create a dataset that pairs target structures with various example instructions (human-authored, template-based, and model-generated) and example code. With this, we systematically evaluate the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs for synthesising this kind of code, given in-context examples. Evaluating in a simulated environment, we find that LLMs are capable of generating accurate `first order code' (instruction sequences), but have problems producing `higher-order code' (abstractions such as functions, or use of loops).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ITL4HRI workshop at RO-MAN 2025 conference</p></details> |

To address this, we intent to improve the multi-programming-lingual (MultiPL) performance of the base LLMs while retaining the most popular ones using restricted computational resources. We consider MultiPL to be a special case of multiple natural languages and propose a MultiPL extension of LLMs utilizing a hybrid mixture of experts (MoE), called MultiPL-MoE. Specifically, MultiPL-MoE combines two paired MoEs to optimize expert selection at both the token and segment levels. The token-level MoE is a standard upcycling MoE structure with a shared expert and a novel gate weight normalization approach that aids in the final fusion with the segment-level MoE. The segment-level MoE incorporates two innovative designs to better capture the syntactic structure and contextual patterns of programming languages: First, using a sliding window to partition the input token sequence into multiple segments; Then, adopting an expert-choice routing strategy that allows experts to select the top-k segments. The results of the experiment proved the effectiveness of MultiPL-MoE.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Challenges Do Developers Face When Using Verification-Aware Programming Languages?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23696v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software reliability is critical in ensuring that the digital systems we depend on function correctly. In software development, increasing software reliability often involves testing. However, for complex and critical systems, developers can use Design by Contract (DbC) methods to define precise specifications that software components must satisfy. Verification-Aware (VA) programming languages support DbC and formal verification at compile-time or run-time, offering stronger correctness guarantees than traditional testing. However, despite the strong guarantees provided by VA languages, their adoption remains limited. In this study, we investigate the barriers to adopting VA languages by analyzing developer discussions on public forums using topic modeling techniques. We complement this analysis with a developer survey to better understand the practical challenges associated with VA languages. Our findings reveal key obstacles to adoption, including steep learning curves and usability issues. Based on these insights, we identify actionable recommendations to improve the usability and accessibility of VA languages. Our findings suggest that simplifying tool interfaces, providing better educational materials, and improving integration with everyday development environments could improve the usability and adoption of these languages. Our work provides actionable insights for improving the usability of VA languages and making verification tools more accessible.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dynamic Programming Framework for Vehicular Task Offloading with Successive Action Improvement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05907v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, task offloading from vehicles with random velocities is optimized via a novel dynamic programming framework. Particularly, in a vehicular network with multiple vehicles and base stations (BSs), computing tasks of vehicles are offloaded via BSs to an edge server. Due to the random velocities, the exact locations of vehicles versus time, namely trajectories, cannot be determined in advance. Hence, instead of deterministic optimization, the cell association, uplink time, and throughput allocation of multiple vehicles during a period of task offloading are formulated as a finite-horizon Markov decision process. In order to derive a low-complexity solution algorithm, a two-time-scale framework is proposed. The scheduling period is divided into super slots, each super slot is further divided into a number of time slots. At the beginning of each super slot, we first obtain a reference scheduling scheme of cell association, uplink time and throughput allocation via deterministic optimization, yielding an approximation of the optimal value function. Within the super slot, the actual scheduling action of each time slot is determined by making improvement to the approximate value function according to the system state. Due to the successive improvement framework, a non-trivial average cost upper bound could be derived. In the simulation, the random trajectories of vehicles are generated from a high-fidelity traffic simulator. It is shown that the performance gain of the proposed scheduling framework over the baselines is significant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Programming tension in 3D printed networks inspired by spiderwebs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05855v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Each element in tensioned structural networks -- such as tensegrity, architectural fabrics, or medical braces/meshes -- requires a specific tension level to achieve and maintain the desired shape, stability, and compliance. These structures are challenging to manufacture, 3D print, or assemble because flattening the network during fabrication introduces multiplicative inaccuracies in the network's final tension gradients. This study overcomes this challenge by offering a fabrication algorithm for direct 3D printing of such networks with programmed tension gradients, an approach analogous to the spinning of spiderwebs. The algorithm: (i) defines the desired network and prescribes its tension gradients using the force density method; (ii) converts the network into an unstretched counterpart by numerically optimizing vertex locations toward target element lengths and converting straight elements into arcs to resolve any remaining error; and (iii) decomposes the network into printable toolpaths; Optional additional steps are: (iv) flattening curved 2D networks or 3D networks to ensure 3D printing compatibility; and (v) automatically resolving any unwanted crossings introduced by the flattening process. The proposed method is experimentally validated using 2D unit cells of viscoelastic filaments, where accurate tension gradients are achieved with an average element strain error of less than 1.0\%. The method remains effective for networks with element minimum length and maximum stress of 5.8 mm and 7.3 MPa, respectively. The method is used to demonstrate the fabrication of three complex cases: a flat spiderweb, a curved mesh, and a tensegrity system. The programmable tension gradient algorithm can be utilized to produce compact, integrated cable networks, enabling novel applications such as moment-exerting structures in medical braces and splints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Natural Language-Programming Language Software Traceability Link Recovery Needs More than Textual Similarity](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05585v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the field of software traceability link recovery (TLR), textual similarity has long been regarded as the core criterion. However, in tasks involving natural language and programming language (NL-PL) artifacts, relying solely on textual similarity is limited by their semantic gap. To this end, we conducted a large-scale empirical evaluation across various types of TLR tasks, revealing the limitations of textual similarity in NL-PL scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an approach that incorporates multiple domain-specific auxiliary strategies, identified through empirical analysis, into two models: the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) via edge types and the prompt-based Gemini 2.5 Pro via additional input information. We then evaluated our approach using the widely studied requirements-to-code TLR task, a representative case of NL-PL TLR. Experimental results show that both the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models outperformed their original counterparts without strategy integration. Furthermore, compared to the current state-of-the-art method HGNNLink, the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models achieved average F1-score improvements of 3.68% and 8.84%, respectively, across twelve open-source projects, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-strategy integration in enhancing overall model performance for the requirements-code TLR task.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 5 images, 11 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |

Specifically, we develop an approximate maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator using dynamic programming and tools from convex analysis. Our approach does not rely on restrictive noise assumptions and employs a Bellman-like update instead of a Bayesian update. Our proposed estimator is computationally efficient, with only modest overhead compared to a standard Kalman filter. Simulations demonstrate that our estimator achieves lower root mean squared error (RMSE) than the Kalman filter and has comparable performance to state-of-the-art estimators, while requiring significantly less computational power.</p></details> |  |

This sophistication motivates a shift toward simpler, more debuggable programming paradigm like Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD). However, SPMD in eager execution introduces two key challenges: ensuring consistency with single-device execution and achieving high performance at scale. In this paper, we introduce veScale, an eager-mode training system that fully embraces SPMD paradigm to democratize distributed tensor programming. veScale addresses the prevalent issue of inconsistent results in systems like PyTorch by introducing a novel algorithm of distributed Random Number Generation (RNG) compatible with arbitrary sharded operators. veScale also significantly boosts training performance by reducing PyTorch primitive's overhead and improving communication efficiency. Evaluations show that veScale delivers up to 2.2x speedup over the state-of-the-art training systems, like TorchTitan, and cuts code complexity by 78.4%, while preserving single-device-equivalent results.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 16 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Several formula-based fault localization (FBFL) methods have been proposed, but they fail to guarantee a set of diagnoses across all failing tests or may produce redundant diagnoses that are not subset-minimal, particularly for programs with multiple faults. This paper introduces a novel fault localization approach for C programs with multiple faults. CFaults leverages Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) with multiple observations and aggregates all failing test cases into a unified MaxSAT formula. Consequently, our method guarantees consistency across observations and simplifies the fault localization procedure. Experimental results on two benchmark sets of C programs, TCAS and C-Pack-IPAs, show that CFaults is faster than other FBFL approaches like BugAssist and SNIPER. Moreover, CFaults only generates subset-minimal diagnoses of faulty statements, whereas the other approaches tend to enumerate redundant diagnoses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FM 2024. 15 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables and 5 listings</p></details> |
| **[AgentArmor: Enforcing Program Analysis on Agent Runtime Trace to Defend Against Prompt Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01249v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a powerful new paradigm for solving various problems by combining natural language reasoning with the execution of external tools. However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present AgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph intermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations (e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system. AgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that reconstructs the agent's runtime traces as graph-based intermediate representations with control and data flow described within; (2) a property registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools \& data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over the intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured programs, AgentArmor enables program analysis for sensitive data flow, trust boundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo benchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can reduce the ASR to 3\%, with the utility drop only 1\%.</p></details> |  |

We study symbolic graphics programming, where the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report (32 pages, 12 figures, project page: https://spherelab.ai/SGP-Gen/)</p></details> |

While many actors may send messages to some actor, only the actor may receive from its mailbox. Although actors eliminate many of the issues stemming from shared memory concurrency, they remain vulnerable to communication errors such as protocol violations and deadlocks. Mailbox types are a novel behavioural type system for mailboxes first introduced for a process calculus by de'Liguoro and Padovani in 2018, which capture the contents of a mailbox as a commutative regular expression. Due to aliasing and nested evaluation contexts, moving from a process calculus to a programming language is challenging. This paper presents Pat, the first programming language design incorporating mailbox types, and describes an algorithmic type system. We make essential use of quasi-linear typing to tame some of the complexity introduced by aliasing. Our algorithmic type system is necessarily co-contextual, achieved through a novel use of backwards bidirectional typing, and we prove it sound and complete with respect to our declarative type system. We extend Pat with sums, products and higher-order functions, and also interfaces that allow finer-grained reasoning about mailbox contents. We implement a prototype type checker, and use it to demonstrate the expressiveness of Pat on a factory automation case study and a series of examples from the Savina actor benchmark suite.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised and extended version of paper accepted to ICFP'23</p></details> |

As quantum computing advances, ensuring the reliability of quantum programs has become increasingly important. This paper introduces NovaQ, a diversity-guided testing framework for quantum programs. NovaQ combines a distribution-based test case generator with a novelty-driven evaluation module. The generator produces diverse quantum state inputs by mutating circuit parameters, while the evaluator quantifies behavioral novelty based on internal circuit state metrics, including magnitude, phase, and entanglement. By selecting inputs that map to infrequently covered regions in the metric space, NovaQ effectively explores under-tested program behaviors. We evaluate NovaQ on quantum programs of varying sizes and complexities. Experimental results show that NovaQ consistently achieves higher test input diversity and detects more bugs than existing baseline approaches.</p></details> | 5 pages |

While several programming models provide portability for diverse GPU systems, they don't make any guarantees about performance portability. In this work, we explore several programming models -- CUDA, HIP, Kokkos, RAJA, OpenMP, OpenACC, and SYCL, to assess the consistency of their performance across NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. We use five proxy applications from different scientific domains, create implementations where missing, and use them to present a comprehensive comparative evaluation of the performance portability of these programming models. We provide a Spack scripting-based methodology to ensure reproducibility of experiments conducted in this work. Finally, we analyze the reasons for why some programming models underperform in certain scenarios and in some cases, present performance optimizations to the proxy applications.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Assessing Large Language Models in Comprehending and Verifying Concurrent Programs across Memory Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14326v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As concurrent programming becomes increasingly prevalent, effectively identifying and addressing concurrency issues such as data races and deadlocks is critical. This study evaluates the performance of several leading large language models (LLMs), including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Mistral-AI's Large2, in understanding and analyzing concurrency issues within software programs. Given that relaxed memory models, such as Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO), are widely implemented and adapted in modern systems, supported even by commodity architectures like ARM and x86, our evaluation focuses not only on sequentially consistent memory models but also on these relaxed memory models. Specifically, we assess two main aspects: the models' capacity to detect concurrency problems under a sequentially consistent memory model and their ability to verify the correctness conditions of concurrent programs across both sequentially consistent and relaxed memory models. To do this, we leverage SV-COMP's pthread tests and 25 ARM Litmus tests designed to evaluate Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO) memory models. The experimental results reveal that GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Mistral-AI's Large2 demonstrate a robust understanding of concurrency issues, effectively identifying data races and deadlocks when assessed under a sequentially consistent memory model. However, despite its superior performance, all selected LLMs face significant challenges verifying program correctness under relaxed memory models. These LLMs exhibit limitations in accurately capturing memory ordering constraints, and their current capabilities fall short in verifying even small programs in these complex scenarios.</p></details> |  |

However, many hesitated to take the vaccine due to concerns about its effectiveness. By looking at an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of disease spread that incorporates a mass vaccination program, this study aims to determine the sensitivity of the cumulative count of infected individuals ($W$) and the cumulative death count ($D$) to the following model parameters: disease transmission rate ($\beta$), reciprocal of the disease latency period ($\kappa$), reciprocal of the infectious period ($\gamma$), death ratio ($\alpha$), vaccine efficacy rate ($r$), and vaccine rollout rate ($\delta$). This was implemented using Latin hypercube sampling and partial rank correlation coefficient. Results show that $D$ is highly sensitive to $\alpha$ and shows increasing sensitivity to $\delta$ in the long run. On the other hand, $W$ is highly sensitive to $\kappa$ at the beginning of the simulation, but this weakens over time. In contrast, $W$ is not very sensitive to $\delta$ initially but becomes very significant in the long run. This supports the importance of the vaccine rollout rate over the vaccine efficacy rate in curbing the spread of the disease in the population. It is also worthwhile to reduce the death ratio by developing a cure for the disease or improving the healthcare system as a whole.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication to SciEnggJ</p></details> |

However, this reliance on untrusted user input introduces a novel and underexplored attack surface. In this paper, we investigate the security risks posed by adversarial bug reports -- realistic-looking issue submissions crafted to mislead APR systems into producing insecure or harmful code changes. We develop a comprehensive threat model and conduct an empirical study to evaluate the vulnerability of state-of-the-art APR systems to such attacks. Our demonstration comprises 51 adversarial bug reports generated across a spectrum of strategies, from manual curation to fully automated pipelines. We test these against leading APR model and assess both pre-repair defenses (e.g., LlamaGuard variants, PromptGuard variants, Granite-Guardian, and custom LLM filters) and post-repair detectors (GitHub Copilot, CodeQL). Our findings show that current defenses are insufficient: 90\% of crafted bug reports triggered attacker-aligned patches. The best pre-repair filter blocked only 47\%, while post-repair analysis-often requiring human oversight-was effective in just 58\% of cases. To support scalable security testing, we introduce a prototype framework for automating the generation of adversarial bug reports. Our analysis exposes a structural asymmetry: generating adversarial inputs is inexpensive, while detecting or mitigating them remains costly and error-prone. We conclude with practical recommendations for improving the robustness of APR systems against adversarial misuse and highlight directions for future work on trustworthy automated repair.</p></details> |  |

With the rise of large language models (LLMs) in recent years, research in programming education has increasingly focused on automated feedback generation to help teachers provide timely support to every student. However, prior studies often overlook key pedagogical principles, such as mastery and progress adaptation, that shape effective feedback strategies. This paper introduces a novel pedagogical framework for LLM-driven feedback generation derived from established feedback models and local insights from secondary school teachers. To evaluate this framework, we implemented a web-based application for Python programming with LLM-based feedback that follows the framework and conducted a mixed-method evaluation with eight secondary-school computer science teachers. Our findings suggest that teachers consider that, when aligned with the framework, LLMs can effectively support students and even outperform human teachers in certain scenarios through instant and precise feedback. However, we also found several limitations, such as its inability to adapt feedback to dynamic classroom contexts.

| **[Parse Tree Tracking Through Time for Programming Process Analysis at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03668v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background and Context: Programming process data can be utilized to understand the processes students use to write computer programming assignments. Keystroke- and line-level event logs have been used in the past in various ways, primarily in high-level descriptive statistics (e.g., timings, character deletion rate, etc). Analysis of behavior in context (e.g., how much time students spend working on loops) has been cumbersome because of our inability to automatically track high-level code representations, such as abstract syntax trees, through time and unparseable states. Objective: Our study has two goals. The first is to design the first algorithm that tracks parse tree nodes through time. Second, we utilize this algorithm to perform a partial replication study of prior work that used manual tracking of code representations, as well as other novel analyses of student programming behavior that can now be done at scale. Method: We use two algorithms presented in this paper to track parse tree nodes through time and construct tree representations for unparseable code states. We apply these algorithms to a public keystroke data from student coursework in a 2021 CS1 course and conduct analysis on the resulting parse trees. Findings: We discover newly observable statistics at scale, including that code is deleted at similar rates inside and outside of conditionals and loops, a third of commented out code is eventually restored, and that frequency with which students jump around in their code may not be indicative of struggle. Implications: The ability to track parse trees through time opens the door to understanding new dimensions of student programming, such as best practices of structural development of code over time, quantitative measurement of what syntactic constructs students struggle most with, refactoring behavior, and attention shifting within the code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably data-driven projection method for quadratic programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04524v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Projection methods aim to reduce the dimensionality of the optimization instance, thereby improving the scalability of high-dimensional problems. Recently, Sakaue and Oki proposed a data-driven approach for linear programs (LPs), where the projection matrix is learned from observed problem instances drawn from an application-specific distribution of problems. We analyze the generalization guarantee for the data-driven projection matrix learning for convex quadratic programs (QPs). Unlike in LPs, the optimal solutions of convex QPs are not confined to the vertices of the feasible polyhedron, and this complicates the analysis of the optimal value function. To overcome this challenge, we demonstrate that the solutions of convex QPs can be localized within a feasible region corresponding to a special active set, utilizing Caratheodory's theorem. Building on such observation, we propose the unrolled active set method, which models the computation of the optimal value as a Goldberg-Jerrum (GJ) algorithm with bounded complexities, thereby establishing learning guarantees. We then further extend our analysis to other settings, including learning to match the optimal solution and input-aware setting, where we learn a mapping from QP problem instances to projection matrices.</p></details> | 25 pages |
| **[Semantically Reflected Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03318v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the dichotomy between the formalization of structural and the formalization of behavioral knowledge by means of semantically lifted programs, which explore an intuitive connection between programs and knowledge graphs. While knowledge graphs and ontologies are eminently useful to represent formal knowledge about a system's individuals and universals, programming languages are designed to describe the system's evolution. To address this dichotomy, we introduce a semantic lifting of the program states of an executing program into a knowledge graph, for an object-oriented programming language. The resulting graph is exposed as a semantic reflection layer within the programming language, allowing programmers to leverage knowledge of the application domain in their programs. In this paper, we formalize semantic lifting and semantic reflection for a small programming language, SMOL, explain the operational aspects of the language, and consider type correctness and virtualisation for runtime program queries through the semantic reflection layer. We illustrate semantic lifting and semantic reflection through a case study of geological modelling and discuss different applications of the technique. The language implementation is open source and available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Gaps Between Student and Expert Evaluations of AI-Generated Programming Hints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03269v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI has the potential to enhance education by providing personalized feedback to students at scale. Recent work has proposed techniques to improve AI-generated programming hints and has evaluated their performance based on expert-designed rubrics or student ratings. However, it remains unclear how the rubrics used to design these techniques align with students' perceived helpfulness of hints. In this paper, we systematically study the mismatches in perceived hint quality from students' and experts' perspectives based on the deployment of AI-generated hints in a Python programming course. We analyze scenarios with discrepancies between student and expert evaluations, in particular, where experts rated a hint as high-quality while the student found it unhelpful. We identify key reasons for these discrepancies and classify them into categories, such as hints not accounting for the student's main concern or not considering previous help requests. Finally, we propose and discuss preliminary results on potential methods to bridge these gaps, first by extending the expert-designed quality rubric and then by adapting the hint generation process, e.g., incorporating the student's comments or history. These efforts contribute toward scalable, personalized, and pedagogically sound AI-assisted feedback systems, which are particularly important for high-enrollment educational settings.</p></details> | L@S'25 |
| **[Plan More, Debug Less: Applying Metacognitive Theory to AI-Assisted Programming Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03171v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing adoption of generative AI in education highlights the need to integrate established pedagogical principles into AI-assisted learning environments. This study investigates the potential of metacognitive theory to inform AI-assisted programming education through a hint system designed around the metacognitive phases of planning, monitoring, and evaluation. Upon request, the system can provide three types of AI-generated hints--planning, debugging, and optimization--to guide students at different stages of problem-solving. Through a study with 102 students in an introductory data science programming course, we find that students perceive and engage with planning hints most highly, whereas optimization hints are rarely requested. We observe a consistent association between requesting planning hints and achieving higher grades across question difficulty and student competency. However, when facing harder tasks, students seek additional debugging but not more planning support. These insights contribute to the growing field of AI-assisted programming education by providing empirical evidence on the importance of pedagogical principles in AI-assisted learning.</p></details> | AIED'25 paper |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Decision-Making Strategy Considering User Satisfaction Feedback in Demand Response Program](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02946v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Demand response providers (DRPs) are intermediaries between the upper-level distribution system operator and the lower-level participants in demand response (DR) programs. Usually, DRPs act as leaders and determine electricity pricing strategies to maximize their economic revenue, while end-users adjust their power consumption following the pricing signals. However, this profit-seeking bi-level optimization model often neglects the satisfaction of end-users participating in DR programs. In addition, the detailed mathematical models underlying user decision-making strategy and satisfaction evaluation mechanism are typically unavailable to DRPs, posing significant challenges to conventional model-based solution methods. To address these issues, this paper designs a user-side satisfaction evaluation mechanism and proposes a multi-branch temporal fusion twin-delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (MBTF-TD3) reinforcement learning algorithm. User satisfaction feedback is incorporated into the reward function via a dynamically adjusted penalty term. The proposed MBTF structure effectively extracts temporal feature dependencies in the time-series observation data, and the dynamically adjusted penalty function successfully enhances the overall satisfaction level of users. Several experiments are conducted to validate the performance and the effectiveness of our proposed solution algorithm.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version corrects equation display errors that occurred in the IEEE Xplore version.

| **[RepairLLaMA: Efficient Representations and Fine-Tuned Adapters for Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15698v6)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) has evolved significantly with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs). Fine-tuning LLMs for program repair is a recent avenue of research, with many dimensions which have not been explored. Existing work mostly fine-tune LLMs with naive code representations and does not scale to frontier models. To address this problem, we propose RepairLLaMA, a novel program repair approach that 1) identifies optimal code representations for APR with fine-tuned models, and 2) pioneers state-of-the-art parameter-efficient fine-tuning technique (PEFT) for program repair. This results in RepairLLaMA producing a highly effective `program repair adapter' for fixing bugs with AI. Our experiments demonstrate the validity of both concepts. First, fine-tuning adapters with program repair specific code representations enables the model to use meaningful repair signals and produce better patches. Second, parameter-efficient fine-tuning helps fine-tuning to converge and clearly contributes to the effectiveness of RepairLLaMA in fixing bugs outside the fine-tuning data distribution. Overall, RepairLLaMA correctly fixes 144 Defects4J v2, 109 HumanEval-Java, and 20 GitBug-Java bugs, outperforming all baselines.</p></details> | Accepted to IEEE TSE |
| **[Rollout-Based Approximate Dynamic Programming for MDPs with Information-Theoretic Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02812v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies a finite-horizon Markov decision problem with information-theoretic constraints, where the goal is to minimize directed information from the controlled source process to the control process, subject to stage-wise cost constraints, aiming for an optimal control policy. We propose a new way of approximating a solution for this problem, which is known to be formulated as an unconstrained MDP with a continuous information-state using Q-factors. To avoid the computational complexity of discretizing the continuous information-state space, we propose a truncated rollout-based backward-forward approximate dynamic programming (ADP) framework. Our approach consists of two phases: an offline base policy approximation over a shorter time horizon, followed by an online rollout lookahead minimization, both supported by provable convergence guarantees. We supplement our theoretical results with a numerical example where we demonstrate the cost improvement of the rollout method compared to a previously proposed policy approximation method, and the computational complexity observed in executing the offline and online phases for the two methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multilinear and Linear Programs for Partially Identifiable Queries in Quasi-Markovian Structural Causal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03548v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate partially identifiable queries in a class of causal models. We focus on acyclic Structural Causal Models that are quasi-Markovian (that is, each endogenous variable is connected with at most one exogenous confounder). We look into scenarios where endogenous variables are observed (and a distribution over them is known), while exogenous variables are not fully specified. This leads to a representation that is in essence a Bayesian network where the distribution of root variables is not uniquely determined. In such circumstances, it may not be possible to precisely compute a probability value of interest. We thus study the computation of tight probability bounds, a problem that has been solved by multilinear programming in general, and by linear programming when a single confounded component is intervened upon. We present a new algorithm to simplify the construction of such programs by exploiting input probabilities over endogenous variables. For scenarios with a single intervention, we apply column generation to compute a probability bound through a sequence of auxiliary linear integer programs, thus showing that a representation with polynomial cardinality for exogenous variables is possible. Experiments show column generation techniques to be superior to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Causal Abstractions and Representations (CAR) workshop of the 41st Conference on Uncertainty in Artificial Intelligence (UAI 2025)</p></details> |
| **[From Traces to Program Incorrectness: A Type-Theoretic Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02428v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a type-theoretic framework for reasoning about incorrectness in functional programs that interact with effectful, opaque library APIs. Our approach centers on traces -- temporally-ordered sequences of library API invocations -- which naturally characterize both the preconditions of individual APIs and their composite behavior. We represent these traces using symbolic regular expressions (SREs), enabling formal specification of incorrect abstract data type (ADT) behaviors across function boundaries. The core contribution is a novel type inference algorithm that operates modulo specified incorrectness properties and leverages the symbolic finite automata (SFAs) representations of regexes for compositional reasoning of traces. When the algorithm succeeds, the inferred types witness that an ADT implementation can exhibit some subset of the specified incorrect behaviors. This represents the first systematic approach to underapproximate reasoning against trace-based incorrectness specifications, enabling a new form of trace-guided compositional analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Genetic Programming with Model Driven Dimension Repair for Learning Interpretable Appointment Scheduling Rules](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02034v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Appointment scheduling is a great challenge in healthcare operations management. Appointment rules (AR) provide medical practitioners with a simple yet effective tool to determine patient appointment times. Genetic programming (GP) can be used to evolve ARs. However, directly applying GP to design ARs may lead to rules that are difficult for end-users to interpret and trust. A key reason is that GP is unaware of the dimensional consistency, which ensures that the evolved rules align with users' domain knowledge and intuitive understanding. In this paper, we develop a new dimensionally aware GP algorithm with dimension repair to evolve ARs with dimensional consistency and high performance. A key innovation of our method is the dimension repair procedure, which optimizes the dimensional consistency of an expression tree while minimizing structural changes and ensuring that its output dimension meets the problem's requirements. We formulate the task as a mixed-integer linear programming model that can be efficiently solved using common mathematical programming methods. With the support of the dimension repair procedure, our method can explore a wider range of AR structures by temporarily breaking the dimensional consistency of individuals, and then restoring it without altering their overall structure, thereby identifying individuals with greater potential advantages. We evaluated the proposed method in a comprehensive set of simulated clinics. The experimental results demonstrate that our approach managed to evolve high-quality ARs that significantly outperform not only the manually designed ARs but also existing state-of-the-art dimensionally aware GP methods in terms of both objective values and dimensional consistency. In addition, we analyzed the semantics of the evolved ARs, providing insight into the design of more effective and interpretable ARs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[ProbTest: Unit Testing for Probabilistic Programs (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.02012v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Testing probabilistic programs is non-trivial due to their stochastic nature. Given an input, the program may produce different outcomes depending on the underlying stochastic choices in the program. This means testing the expected outcomes of probabilistic programs requires repeated test executions unlike deterministic programs where a single execution may suffice for each test input. This raises the following question: how many times should we run a probabilistic program to effectively test it? This work proposes a novel black-box unit testing method, ProbTest, for testing the outcomes of probabilistic programs. Our method is founded on the theory surrounding a well-known combinatorial problem, the coupon collector's problem. Using this method, developers can write unit tests as usual without extra effort while the number of required test executions is determined automatically with statistical guarantees for the results. We implement ProbTest as a plug-in for PyTest, a well-known unit testing tool for python programs. Using this plug-in, developers can write unit tests similar to any other Python program and the necessary test executions are handled automatically. We evaluate the method on case studies from the Gymnasium reinforcement learning library and a randomized data structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print of paper to appear in the proceedings of the 23nd edition of the International Conference on Software Engineering and Formal Methods (SEFM'25)</p></details> |
| **[Automated Repair of C Programs Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01947v1)** | 2025-09-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study explores the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in automating the repair of C programs. We present a framework that integrates spectrum-based fault localization (SBFL), runtime feedback, and Chain-of-Thought-structured prompting into an autonomous repair loop. Unlike prior approaches, our method explicitly combines statistical program analysis with LLM reasoning. The iterative repair cycle leverages a structured Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting approach, where the model reasons over failing tests, suspicious code regions, and prior patch outcomes, before generating new candidate patches. The model iteratively changes the code, evaluates the results, and incorporates reasoning from previous attempts into subsequent modifications, reducing repeated errors and clarifying why some bugs remain unresolved. Our evaluation spans 3,902 bugs from the Codeflaws benchmark, where our approach achieves 44.93% repair accuracy, representing a 3.61% absolute improvement over strong state-of-the-art APR baselines such as GPT-4 with CoT. This outcome highlights a practical pathway toward integrating statistical program analysis with generative AI in automated debugging.</p></details> |  |
| **[Laws of Quantum Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19463v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate the fundamental laws of quantum programming. We extend a comprehensive set of Hoare et al.'s basic laws of classical programming to the quantum setting. These laws characterise the algebraic properties of quantum programs, such as the distributivity of sequential composition over (quantum) if-statements and the unfolding of nested (quantum) if-statements. At the same time, we clarify some subtle differences between certain laws of classical programming and their quantum counterparts. Additionally, we derive a fixpoint characterisation of quantum while-loops and a loop-based realisation of tail recursion in quantum programming. Furthermore, we establish two normal form theorems: one for quantum circuits and one for finite quantum programs. The theory in which these laws are established is formalised in the Coq proof assistant, and all of these laws are mechanically verified. As an application case of our laws, we present a formal derivation of the principle of deferred measurements in dynamic quantum circuits. We expect that these laws can be utilised in correctness-preserving transformation, compilation, and automatic code optimisation in quantum programming. In particular, because these laws are formally verified in Coq, they can be confidently applied in quantum program development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Traq: Estimating the Quantum Cost of Classical Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01508v1)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predicting practical speedups offered by future quantum computers has become a major focus of the quantum computing community. Typically, these predictions are supported by lengthy manual analyses and numerical simulations and are carried out for one specific application at a time. In this paper, we present Traq, a principled approach towards estimating the quantum speedup of classical programs fully automatically and with provable guarantees. It consists of a classical language that includes high-level primitives amenable to quantum speedups, a cost analysis, and a compilation to low-level quantum programs. Our cost analysis upper bounds the complexity of the resulting quantum program in a fine-grained way: it captures non-asymptotic information and is sensitive to the input of the program (rather than providing worst-case costs). We also provide a proof-of-concept implementation and a case study inspired by AND-OR trees.</p></details> | 50 pages |
| **[Let's Take Esoteric Programming Languages Seriously](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15327v2)** | 2025-09-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Esoteric programming languages are challenging to learn, but their unusual features and constraints may serve to improve programming ability. From languages designed to be intentionally obtuse (e.g. INTERCAL) to others targeting artistic expression (e.g. Piet) or exploring the nature of computation (e.g. Fractan), there is rich variety in the realm of esoteric programming languages. This essay examines the counterintuitive appeal of esoteric languages and seeks to analyse reasons for this popularity. We will explore why people are attracted to esoteric languages in terms of (a) program comprehension and construction, as well as (b) language design and implementation. Our assertion is that esoteric languages can improve general PL awareness, at the same time as enabling the esoteric programmer to impress their peers with obscure knowledge. We will also consider pedagogic principles and the use of AI, in relation to esoteric languages. Emerging from the specific discussion, we identify a general set of 'good' reasons for designing new programming languages. It may not be possible to be exhaustive on this topic, and it is certain we have not achieved that goal here. However we believe our most important contribution is to draw attention to the varied and often implicit motivations involved in programming language design.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

The model describes a minimal set of abstract operations to enable hardware topology discovery, kernel execution, memory management, communication, and instance management, without prescribing any implementation decisions. The goal of the model is to enable execution in current and future systems without the need for significant refactoring, while also being able to serve any governing parallel programming paradigm. In terms of software abstraction, HiCR is naturally located between distributed heterogeneous systems and runtime systems. We coin the phrase \emph{Runtime Support Layer} for this level of abstraction. We explain how the model's components and operations are realized by a plugin-based approach that takes care of device-specific implementation details, and present examples of HiCR-based applications that operate equally on a diversity of platforms.</p></details> |  |

There are many applications of linear programming methods and polyhedral representation conversion methods in game theory. In this paper, we discuss two more scenarios where such methods can be useful. The first scenario is predicting the results of independent truncation dynamics under the large population assumption. The second scenario is when a player's opponent in a normal form game is not completely rational but shows some degree of malice. We show how one can compute a more profitable defensive play compared to simply playing a maximin strategy. We provide detailed computation procedure and numerical results for both scenarios.</p></details> |  |

When small language models are tasked with generating probabilistic programs, they frequently produce outputs that suffer from both syntactic and semantic errors, such as flawed inference constructs. Motivated by probabilistic programmers' domain expertise and debugging strategies, we introduce RefineStat, a language model--driven framework that enforces semantic constraints ensuring synthesized programs contain valid distributions and well-formed parameters, and then applies diagnostic-aware refinement by resampling prior or likelihood components whenever reliability checks fail. We evaluate RefineStat on multiple probabilistic-programming code-generation tasks using smaller language models (SLMs) and find that it produces programs that are both syntactically sound and statistically reliable, often matching or surpassing those from closed-source large language models (e.g., OpenAI o3).</p></details> | <details><summary>Refin...</summary><p>RefineStat constrains LM decoding with statistical validity checks and uses diagnostic-guided resampling (priors/likelihoods) to transform small LMs' drafts into correct, reliable probabilistic programs that can match or surpass closed-source models</p></details> |
| **[Tilus: A Tile-Level GPGPU Programming Language for Low-Precision Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12984v3)** | 2025-08-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serving Large Language Models (LLMs) is critical for AI-powered applications, yet it demands substantial computational resources, particularly in memory bandwidth and computational throughput. Low-precision computation has emerged as a key technique to improve efficiency while reducing resource consumption. Existing approaches for generating low-precision kernels are limited to weight bit widths that are powers of two and suffer from suboptimal performance because of high-level GPU programming abstractions. These abstractions restrict critical optimizations, such as fine-grained register management and optimized memory access patterns, that are essential for efficient low-precision computations. In this paper, we introduce Tilus, a domain-specific language designed for General-Purpose GPU (GPGPU) computing that supports low-precision data types with arbitrary bit widths from 1 to 8 while maintaining GPU programmability. Tilus features a thread-block-level programming model, a hierarchical memory space, a novel algebraic layout system, and extensive support for diverse low-precision data types. Tilus programs are compiled into highly efficient GPU programs through automatic vectorization and instruction selection. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Tilus efficiently supports a full spectrum of low-precision data types, and outperforms state-of-the-art low-precision kernels. Compared to existing compilers such as Triton and Ladder, as well as hand-optimized kernels such as QuantLLM and Marlin, Tilus achieves performance improvements of: $1.75\times$, $2.61\times$, $1.29\times$ and $1.03\times$, respectively. We open-source Tilus at https://github.com/NVIDIA/tilus.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 14 figures, 1 table</p></details> |
