| **[Homeostatic Adaptation of Optimal Population Codes under Metabolic Stress](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07874v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information processing in neural populations is inherently constrained by metabolic resource limits and noise properties, with dynamics that are not accurately described by existing mathematical models. Recent data, for example, shows that neurons in mouse visual cortex go into a "low power mode" in which they maintain firing rate homeostasis while expending less energy. This adaptation leads to increased neuronal noise and tuning curve flattening in response to metabolic stress. We have developed a theoretical population coding framework that captures this behavior using two novel, surprisingly simple constraints: an approximation of firing rate homeostasis and an energy limit tied to noise levels via biophysical simulation. A key feature of our contribution is an energy budget model directly connecting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) use in cells to a fully explainable mathematical framework that generalizes existing optimal population codes. Specifically, our simulation provides an energy-dependent dispersed Poisson noise model, based on the assumption that the cell will follow an optimal decay path to produce the least-noisy spike rate that is possible at a given cellular energy budget. Each state along this optimal path is associated with properties (resting potential and leak conductance) which can be measured in electrophysiology experiments and have been shown to change under prolonged caloric deprivation. We analytically derive the optimal coding strategy for neurons under varying energy budgets and coding goals, and show how our method uniquely captures how populations of tuning curves adapt while maintaining homeostasis, as has been observed empirically.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalized bilateral multilevel construction for constant dimension codes from parallel mixed dimension construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07842v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constant dimension codes (CDCs), as special subspace codes, have received extensive attention due to their applications in random network coding. The basic problem of CDCs is to determine the maximal possible size $A_q(n,d,\{k\})$ for given parameters $q, n, d$, and $k$. This paper introduces criteria for choosing appropriate bilateral identifying vectors compatible with the parallel mixed dimension construction (Des. Codes Cryptogr. 93(1):227--241, 2025). We then utilize the generalized bilateral multilevel construction (Des. Codes Cryptogr. 93(1):197--225, 2025) to improve the parallel mixed dimension construction efficiently. Many new CDCs that are better than the previously best-known codes are constructed.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Code-Switching in End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition: A Systematic Literature Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07741v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by a growing research interest into automatic speech recognition (ASR), and the growing body of work for languages in which code-switching (CS) often occurs, we present a systematic literature review of code-switching in end-to-end ASR models. We collect and manually annotate papers published in peer reviewed venues. We document the languages considered, datasets, metrics, model choices, and performance, and present a discussion of challenges in end-to-end ASR for code-switching. Our analysis thus provides insights on current research efforts and available resources as well as opportunities and gaps to guide future research.</p></details> |  |

Corresponding bounds and constructions of codes for the $b$-symbol metric, especially the pair-symbol metric where $b=2$, were intensively studied in the last fifteen years. Here we determine the optimal code parameters of linear codes in the $b$-symbol metric assuming that the minimum distance is sufficiently large. We also determine the optimal parameters of linear binary codes in the pair-symbol metric for small dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 1 table.

| **[Improving Cross-lingual Representation for Semantic Retrieval with Code-switching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.01364v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic Retrieval (SR) has become an indispensable part of the FAQ system in the task-oriented question-answering (QA) dialogue scenario. The demands for a cross-lingual smart-customer-service system for an e-commerce platform or some particular business conditions have been increasing recently. Most previous studies exploit cross-lingual pre-trained models (PTMs) for multi-lingual knowledge retrieval directly, while some others also leverage the continual pre-training before fine-tuning PTMs on the downstream tasks. However, no matter which schema is used, the previous work ignores to inform PTMs of some features of the downstream task, i.e. train their PTMs without providing any signals related to SR. To this end, in this work, we propose an Alternative Cross-lingual PTM for SR via code-switching. We are the first to utilize the code-switching approach for cross-lingual SR. Besides, we introduce the novel code-switched continual pre-training instead of directly using the PTMs on the SR tasks. The experimental results show that our proposed approach consistently outperforms the previous SOTA methods on SR and semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks with three business corpora and four open datasets in 20+ languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[T-GVC: Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding at Ultra-Low Bitrates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07633v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging paradigm of generative video coding, aiming to achieve semantically accurate reconstructions in Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging strong generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or an excessive dependence on high-level text guidance, which often fails to capture motion details and results in unrealistic reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose a Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding framework (dubbed T-GVC). T-GVC employs a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline to effectively bridge low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding by extracting pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic importance, not only significantly reducing the bitrate but also preserving critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by incorporating trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a training-free latent space guidance mechanism to ensure physically plausible motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative models. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework outperforms both traditional codecs and state-of-the-art end-to-end video compression methods under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our approach achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided by geometric motion modeling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Secure Cooperative Gradient Coding: Optimality, Reliability, and Global Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07565v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies privacy-sensitive federated learning (FL) with unreliable communication, focusing on secure aggregation and straggler mitigation. While secure aggregation cryptographically reconstructs the global model without exposing client updates, random link failures disrupt its key coordination, degrading model accuracy. Moreover, unreliable communication can lead to objective inconsistency, causing the global model to converge to arbitrary, sub-optimal points far from the intended optimum. This paper proposes Secure Cooperative Gradient Coding (SecCoGC), a practical solution that achieves secure aggregation with arbitrarily strong privacy guarantees and robust straggler mitigation under unreliable communication. SecCoGC operates natively in the real field, making it directly applicable to practical deployments. To ensure equitable privacy protection across clients, we further introduce Fair-SecCoGC, an extension that enforces fairness in the level of privacy offered to all users. To conclude, this paper formally formulates the problem of secure aggregation in the real field and presents both general and computationally efficient key construction methods. Moreover, it provides a comprehensive privacy analysis under Local Mutual Information Privacy (LMIP) and Local Differential Privacy (LDP) across all protocol layers. Robustness and convergence properties are also rigorously analyzed. Finally, extensive simulations are performed across diverse network conditions and benchmark datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods. The results show that SecCoGC achieves strong robustness to unreliable communication under arbitrarily strong privacy guarantees. It outperforms existing privacy-preserving methods with performance gains of up to 20\%-70\%.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Requirements to Code: Understanding Developer Practices in LLM-Assisted Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07548v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the advent of generative LLMs and their advanced code generation capabilities, some people already envision the end of traditional software engineering, as LLMs may be able to produce high-quality code based solely on the requirements a domain expert feeds into the system. The feasibility of this vision can be assessed by understanding how developers currently incorporate requirements when using LLMs for code generation-a topic that remains largely unexplored. We interviewed 18 practitioners from 14 companies to understand how they (re)use information from requirements and other design artifacts to feed LLMs when generating code. Based on our findings, we propose a theory that explains the processes developers employ and the artifacts they rely on. Our theory suggests that requirements, as typically documented, are too abstract for direct input into LLMs. Instead, they must first be manually decomposed into programming tasks, which are then enriched with design decisions and architectural constraints before being used in prompts. Our study highlights that fundamental RE work is still necessary when LLMs are used to generate code. Our theory is important for contextualizing scientific approaches to automating requirements-centric SE tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted for publication at the 33rd IEEE International Requirements Engineering (RE) conference</p></details> |
| **[Teaching LLM to Reason: Reinforcement Learning from Algorithmic Problems without Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07498v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enhancing reasoning capabilities remains a central focus in the LLM reasearch community. A promising direction involves requiring models to simulate code execution step-by-step to derive outputs for given inputs. However, as code is often designed for large-scale systems, direct application leads to over-reliance on complex data structures and algorithms, even for simple cases, resulting in overfitting to algorithmic patterns rather than core reasoning structures. To address this, we propose TeaR, which aims at teaching LLMs to reason better. TeaR leverages careful data curation and reinforcement learning to guide models in discovering optimal reasoning paths through code-related tasks, thereby improving general reasoning abilities. We conduct extensive experiments using two base models and three long-CoT distillation models, with model sizes ranging from 1.5 billion to 32 billion parameters, and across 17 benchmarks spanning Math, Knowledge, Code, and Logical Reasoning. The results consistently show significant performance improvements. Notably, TeaR achieves a 35.9% improvement on Qwen2.5-7B and 5.9% on R1-Distilled-7B.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Verification for LLM Code Generation: From Generation to Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06920v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently achieved notable success in code-generation benchmarks such as HumanEval and LiveCodeBench. However, a detailed examination reveals that these evaluation suites often comprise only a limited number of homogeneous test cases, resulting in subtle faults going undetected. This not only artificially inflates measured performance but also compromises accurate reward estimation in reinforcement learning frameworks utilizing verifiable rewards (RLVR). To address these critical shortcomings, we systematically investigate the test-case generation (TCG) task by proposing multi-dimensional metrics designed to rigorously quantify test-suite thoroughness. Furthermore, we introduce a human-LLM collaborative method (SAGA), leveraging human programming expertise with LLM reasoning capability, aimed at significantly enhancing both the coverage and the quality of generated test cases. In addition, we develop a TCGBench to facilitate the study of the TCG task. Experiments show that SAGA achieves a detection rate of 90.62% and a verifier accuracy of 32.58% on TCGBench. The Verifier Accuracy (Verifier Acc) of the code generation evaluation benchmark synthesized by SAGA is 10.78% higher than that of LiveCodeBench-v6. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method. We hope this work contributes to building a scalable foundation for reliable LLM code evaluation, further advancing RLVR in code generation, and paving the way for automated adversarial test synthesis and adaptive benchmark integration.</p></details> |  |
| **[EditLord: Learning Code Transformation Rules for Code Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15284v4)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code editing is a foundational task in software development, where its effectiveness depends on whether it introduces desired code property changes without changing the original code's intended functionality. Existing approaches often formulate code editing as an implicit end-to-end task, omitting the fact that code-editing procedures inherently consist of discrete and explicit steps. Thus, they suffer from suboptimal performance and lack of robustness and generalization. We introduce EditLord, a code editing framework that makes the code transformation steps explicit. Our key insight is to employ a language model (LM) as an inductive learner to extract code editing rules from the training code pairs as concise meta-rule sets. Such rule sets will be manifested for each training sample to augment them for finetuning or assist in prompting- and iterative-based code editing. EditLord outperforms the state-of-the-art by an average of 22.7% in editing performance and 58.1% in robustness while achieving 20.2% higher functional correctness across critical software engineering and security applications, LM models, and editing modes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Measuring how changes in code readability attributes affect code quality evaluation by Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05289v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code readability is one of the main aspects of code quality, influenced by various properties like identifier names, comments, code structure, and adherence to standards. However, measuring this attribute poses challenges in both industry and academia. While static analysis tools assess attributes such as code smells and comment percentage, code reviews introduce an element of subjectivity. This paper explores using Large Language Models (LLMs) to evaluate code quality attributes related to its readability in a standardized, reproducible, and consistent manner. We conducted a quasi-experiment study to measure the effects of code changes on Large Language Model (LLM)s interpretation regarding its readability quality attribute. Nine LLMs were tested, undergoing three interventions: removing comments, replacing identifier names with obscure names, and refactoring to remove code smells. Each intervention involved 10 batch analyses per LLM, collecting data on response variability. We compared the results with a known reference model and tool. The results showed that all LLMs were sensitive to the interventions, with agreement with the reference classifier being high for the original and refactored code scenarios. The LLMs demonstrated a strong semantic sensitivity that the reference model did not fully capture. A thematic analysis of the LLMs reasoning confirmed their evaluations directly reflected the nature of each intervention. The models also exhibited response variability, with 9.37% to 14.58% of executions showing a standard deviation greater than zero, indicating response oscillation, though this did not always compromise the statistical significance of the results. LLMs demonstrated potential for evaluating semantic quality aspects, such as coherence between identifier names, comments, and documentation with code purpose.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Channel Coding Performance Through Cost Variability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.05260v3)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Channel coding for discrete memoryless channels (DMCs) with mean and variance cost constraints has been recently introduced. We show that there is an improvement in coding performance due to cost variability, both with and without feedback. We demonstrate this improvement over the traditional almost-sure (per-codeword) cost constraint that prohibits any cost variation above a fixed threshold. Our result simultaneously shows that feedback does not improve the second-order coding rate of simple-dispersion DMCs under the almost-sure cost constraint. This finding parallels similar results for unconstrained simple-dispersion DMCs, additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels and parallel Gaussian channels.</p></details> |  |
| **[Are They All Good? Evaluating the Quality of CoTs in LLM-based Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06980v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive performance in code generation, particularly when augmented with chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting techniques. They break down requirements into intermediate reasoning steps, which act as design rationales to guide LLMs in writing code like human programmers. Thus, the quality of these steps is crucial for ensuring the correctness and reliability of the generated code. However, little is known about the quality of CoT generated by LLMs. To what extent can we trust the thoughts generated by LLMs? How good are they? This paper empirically explores the external and internal factors of why LLMs generate unsatisfactory CoTs by analyzing 1,023 failed code samples on two widely used code generation benchmarks. We also evaluate their impact on code generation performance by analyzing 210 CoT-code pairs and refining the unsatisfied CoTs by prompting LLMs. Our study reveals three key findings: (1) External factors (53.60%), such as unclear requirements and lack of context, mainly affect CoT quality, while internal factors (40.10%) stem from LLMs' misunderstanding prompts. (2) Even when CoTs are correct, 18.5% of the generated code contains errors due to instruction-following issues; conversely, 11.90% of correct code is paired with flawed CoTs. (3) Refining low-quality CoTs is feasible, i.e., LLMs improve when given detailed problem descriptions. These findings highlight key challenges in CoT-based code generation and suggest directions for improving LLM reasoning and reliability.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Error Exponent Distribution of Code Ensembles over Classical-Quantum Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06868v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that the probability distribution of the error exponent in i.i.d. code ensembles over classical-quantum (CQ) channels with arbitrary output states accumulates above a threshold that is strictly larger than the CQ random coding exponent (RCE) at low rates, while coinciding with it at rates close to the mutual information of the channel. This result, combined with the work by Dalai [1] and the recent ones by Renes [2] and Li and Yang [3], implies that the ensemble distribution of error exponents concentrates around the CQ RCE in the high rate regime. Moreover, in the same rate regime the threshold we derive coincides with the ensemble-average of the exponent, that is, the typical random coding (TRC) exponent [4].</p></details> | <details><summary>A sho...</summary><p>A shortened version of this manuscript has been accepted at the IEEE Information Theory Workshop 2025 (IEEE ITW 2025), Sep. 29 - Oct., Sydney, Australia</p></details> |
| **[One Size Does Not Fit All: Investigating Efficacy of Perplexity in Detecting LLM-Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.16525v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model-generated code (LLMgCode) has become increasingly common in software development. So far LLMgCode has more quality issues than human-authored code (HaCode). It is common for LLMgCode to mix with HaCode in a code change, while the change is signed by only human developers, without being carefully examined. Many automated methods have been proposed to detect LLMgCode from HaCode, in which the perplexity-based method (PERPLEXITY for short) is the state-of-the-art method. However, the efficacy evaluation of PERPLEXITY has focused on detection accuracy. Yet it is unclear whether PERPLEXITY is good enough in a wider range of realistic evaluation settings. To this end, we carry out a family of experiments to compare PERPLEXITY against feature- and pre-training-based methods from three perspectives: detection accuracy, detection speed, and generalization capability. The experimental results show that PERPLEXITY has the best generalization capability while having limited detection accuracy and detection speed. Based on that, we discuss the strengths and limitations of PERPLEXITY, e.g., PERPLEXITY is unsuitable for high-level programming languages. Finally, we provide recommendations to improve PERPLEXITY and apply it in practice. As the first large-scale investigation on detecting LLMgCode from HaCode, this article provides a wide range of findings for future improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted by ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM)</p></details> |
| **[Before & After: The Effect of EU's 2022 Code of Practice on Disinformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11369v2)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the past few years, the European Commission has made significant steps to reduce disinformation in cyberspace. One of those steps has been the introduction of the 2022 "Strengthened Code of Practice on Disinformation". Signed by leading online platforms, this Strengthened Code of Practice on Disinformation is an attempt to combat disinformation on the Web. The Code of Practice includes a variety of measures including the demonetization of disinformation, urging, for example, advertisers "to avoid the placement of advertising next to Disinformation content". In this work, we set out to explore what was the impact of the Code of Practice and especially to explore to what extent ad networks continue to advertise on dis-/mis-information sites. We perform a historical analysis and find that, although at a hasty glance things may seem to be improving, there is really no significant reduction in the amount of advertising relationships among popular misinformation websites and major ad networks. In fact, we show that ad networks have withdrawn mostly from unpopular misinformation websites with very few visitors, but still form relationships with highly unreliable websites that account for the majority of misinformation traffic. To make matters worse, we show that ad networks continue to place advertisements of legitimate companies next to misinformation content. We show that major ad networks place ads in almost 400 misinformation websites in our dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>WWW '...</summary><p>WWW '25: Proceedings of the ACM on Web Conference 2025</p></details> |
| **[Assessing Small Language Models for Code Generation: An Empirical Study with Benchmarks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03160v3)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent advancements of Small Language Models (SLMs) have opened new possibilities for efficient code generation. SLMs offer lightweight and cost-effective alternatives to Large Language Models (LLMs), making them attractive for use in resource-constrained environments. However, empirical understanding of SLMs, particularly their capabilities, limitations, and performance trade-offs in code generation remains limited. This study presents a comprehensive empirical evaluation of 20 open-source SLMs ranging from 0.4B to 10B parameters on five diverse code-related benchmarks (HumanEval, MBPP, Mercury, HumanEvalPack, and CodeXGLUE). The models are assessed along three dimensions: i) functional correctness of generated code, ii) computational efficiency and iii) performance across multiple programming languages. The findings of this study reveal that several compact SLMs achieve competitive results while maintaining a balance between performance and efficiency, making them viable for deployment in resource-constrained environments. However, achieving further improvements in accuracy requires switching to larger models. These models generally outperform their smaller counterparts, but they require much more computational power. We observe that for 10% performance improvements, models can require nearly a 4x increase in VRAM consumption, highlighting a trade-off between effectiveness and scalability. Besides, the multilingual performance analysis reveals that SLMs tend to perform better in languages such as Python, Java, and PHP, while exhibiting relatively weaker performance in Go, C++, and Ruby. However, statistical analysis suggests these differences are not significant, indicating a generalizability of SLMs across programming languages. Based on the findings, this work provides insights into the design and selection of SLMs for real-world code generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 Tables, 57 figures.

While extensive research has focused on verifying the correctness of compilers for single-language compilation, the correctness of cross-language compilation - which involves the interaction between two languages and their respective compilers - remains largely unexplored. To fill this research gap, we propose CrossLangFuzzer, a novel framework that introduces a universal intermediate representation (IR) for JVM-based languages and automatically generates cross-language test programs with diverse type parameters and complex inheritance structures. After generating the initial IR, CrossLangFuzzer applies three mutation techniques - LangShuffler, FunctionRemoval, and TypeChanger - to enhance program diversity. By evaluating both the original and mutated programs across multiple compiler versions, CrossLangFuzzer successfully uncovered 10 confirmed bugs in the Kotlin compiler, 4 confirmed bugs in the Groovy compiler, 7 confirmed bugs in the Scala 3 compiler, 2 confirmed bugs in the Scala 2 compiler, and 1 confirmed bug in the Java compiler. Among all mutators, TypeChanger is the most effective, detecting 11 of the 24 compiler bugs. Furthermore, we analyze the symptoms and root causes of cross-compilation bugs, examining the respective responsibilities of language compilers when incorrect behavior occurs during cross-language compilation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the firstwork specifically focused on identifying and diagnosing compiler bugs in cross-language compilation scenarios. Our research helps to understand these challenges and contributes to improving compiler correctness in multi-language environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>The 4...</summary><p>The 40th ACM SIGPLAN International Conference on Object-Oriented Programming, Systems, Languages, and Applications (OOPSLA)</p></details> |

While quantization to 8 or 4 bits mitigates this, sub-3-bit methods face severe accuracy, scalability, and efficiency degradation. We propose Convolutional Code Quantization (CCQ), an inference-optimized quantization approach compressing LLMs to 2.0-2.75 bits with minimal accuracy loss. Departing from error-prone scalar quantization or slow vector quantization, CCQ integrates a hardware-aware bit-shift encoding and decoding solution with Convolutional Code, Hybrid Encoding, and Code Cluster, jointly overcoming accuracy-speed bottlenecks. We construct a lookup-free encoding space, enabling a linear mapping between the codebook and weight vectors, thereby optimizing inference performance. Meanwhile, by drawing on the concept of data mapping from vector quantization, we minimize the performance degradation of the model under extremely low-bit conditions. Experiments demonstrate that CCQ achieves outstanding performance on LLMs across various benchmarks. We compress DeepSeek-V3 (671B total parameters) to 184GB and ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B to 89GB, enabling single-GPU deployment of ERNIE 4.5 and eliminating inter-card communication. The 2-bit ERNIE-4.5-300B-A47B model and inference engine have been open-sourced.</p></details> | 11 pages, 3 figures |

For example, prior work benchmarking the performance of multilingual LLMs on code-mixed translation tasks has demonstrated that current state-of-the-art multilingual LLMs are ineffective in dealing with code-mixed languages. However, the question of how to improve the capability of multilingual LLMs to handle code-mixed language has not received any attention to date. In this paper, we tackle this research gap by proposing CHAI, a novel general-purpose framework for improving the ability of multilingual LLMs to handle code-mixed languages. CHAI relies on three novel contributions made in this paper. First, we explore the ability of LLMs to provide accurate annotations for code-mixed translation tasks. Second, we leverage this ability of LLMs as annotators to generate preference data for code-mixed translation tasks at scale, which are then used within a reinforcement learning from AI feedback (RLAIF) procedure to improve LLMs' capability on code-mixed tasks. Third, we conduct a rigorous experimental evaluation across various real-world datasets and settings. Our analysis shows that CHAI-powered LLMs outperform state-of-the-art open-source LLMs by 25.66% (in terms of win rate adjudicated by human annotators) in code-mixed translation tasks. This work represents a first step towards developing more inclusive code-mixed LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>full ...</summary><p>full draft v2: 8 pages, 3 figures</p></details> |

We present the first systematic study of LLMs' ability to generate efficient C implementations of graph-analysis routines--code that must satisfy the stringent runtime and memory constraints. Eight state-of-the-art models (OpenAI ChatGPT o3 and o4-mini-high, Anthropic Claude 4 Sonnet and Sonnet Extended, Google Gemini 2.5 Flash and Pro, xAI Grok 3-Think, and DeepSeek DeepThink R1) are benchmarked by two distinct approaches. The first approach checks the ability of LLMs in generating an algorithm outperforming other present algorithms in the benchmark. The second approach evaluates the ability of LLMs to generate graph algorithms for integration into the benchmark. Results show that Claude Sonnet 4 Extended achieves the best result in the case of ready-to-use code generation and efficiency, outperforming human-written baselines in triangle counting. The study confirms that contemporary LLMs excel at optimizing and integrating established algorithms but not inventing novel techniques. We provide prompts, the first approach's generated code, and measurement scripts to foster reproducible research.</p></details> |  |

Our method identifies unreliable bits via BP oscillation statistics, generates a set of modified test patterns, and decodes them in parallel using low-iteration BP. We demonstrate that our approach can achieve logical error rates comparable to or even better than BP-OSD, but has lower latency over its parallelization for a variety of bivariate bicycle codes, which significantly reduces decoding complexity.</p></details> |  |

However, LLMs are prone to generate hallucinations, i.e., they generate text which sounds plausible but is incorrect. Although there has been a recent surge in research on LLM hallucinations for text generation, similar hallucination phenomenon can happen in code generation. Sometimes the generated code can have syntactical or logical errors as well as more advanced issues like security vulnerabilities, memory leaks, etc. Given the wide adaptation of LLMs to enhance efficiency in code generation and development in general, it becomes imperative to investigate hallucinations in code generation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt at studying hallucinations in the code generated by LLMs. We start by introducing the code hallucination definition and a comprehensive taxonomy of code hallucination types. We propose the first benchmark CodeMirage dataset for code hallucinations. The benchmark contains 1,137 GPT-3.5 generated hallucinated code snippets for Python programming problems from two base datasets - HumanEval and MBPP. We then propose the methodology for code hallucination detection and experiment with open source LLMs such as CodeLLaMA as well as OpenAI's GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 models using one-shot prompt. We find that GPT-4 performs the best on HumanEval dataset and gives comparable results to the fine-tuned CodeBERT baseline on MBPP dataset. Towards the end, we discuss various mitigation strategies for code hallucinations and conclude our work.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AutoMates @ IJCAI 2024</p></details> |

However, the amount of publicly available Verilog code pales in comparison to the amount of code available for software languages like Python. In this work, we present hdl2v ("HDL-to-Verilog"), a dataset which seeks to increase the amount of available human-written Verilog data by translating or compiling three other hardware description languages - VHDL, Chisel, and PyMTL3 - to Verilog. Furthermore, we demonstrate the value of hdl2v in enhancing LLM Verilog generation by improving performance of a 32 billion-parameter open-weight model by up to 23% (pass@10) in VerilogEvalV2, without utilizing any data augmentation or knowledge distillation from larger models. We also show hdl2v's ability to boost the performance of a data augmentation-based fine-tuning approach by 63%. Finally, we characterize and analyze our dataset to better understand which characteristics of HDL-to-Verilog datasets can be expanded upon in future work for even better performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Machine Learning for CAD (MLCAD) 2025</p></details> |
| **[Coding Triangle: How Does Large Language Model Understand Code?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06138v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code generation, yet their true programming competence remains underexplored. We introduce the Code Triangle framework, which systematically evaluates LLMs across three fundamental dimensions: editorial analysis, code implementation, and test case generation. Through extensive experiments on competitive programming benchmarks, we reveal that while LLMs can form a self-consistent system across these dimensions, their solutions often lack the diversity and robustness of human programmers. We identify a significant distribution shift between model cognition and human expertise, with model errors tending to cluster due to training data biases and limited reasoning transfer. Our study demonstrates that incorporating human-generated editorials, solutions, and diverse test cases, as well as leveraging model mixtures, can substantially enhance both the performance and robustness of LLMs. Furthermore, we reveal both the consistency and inconsistency in the cognition of LLMs that may facilitate self-reflection and self-improvement, providing a potential direction for developing more powerful coding models.</p></details> |  |

But these efforts can be undone by compilers, whose optimizations may silently reintroduce leaks. While recent works have measured the extent of such leakage, they leave developers without actionable insights: which optimization passes are responsible, and how to disable them without modifying the compiler remains unclear. In this paper, we conduct a qualitative analysis of how compiler optimizations break constant-time code. We construct a dataset of compiler-introduced constant-time violations and analyze the internals of two widely used compilers, GCC and LLVM, to identify the specific optimization passes responsible. Our key insight is that a small set of passes are at the root of most leaks. To the best of our knowledge, we are also the first to characterize how the interactions between these passes contribute to leakage. Based on this analysis, we propose an original and practical mitigation that requires no source code modification or custom compiler: disabling selected optimization passes via compiler flags. We show that this approach significantly reduces leakage with minimal performance overhead, offering an immediately deployable defense for developers.</p></details> | 11 pages |

A typical scenario involves scammers deploying honeypot contracts to attract investments, restricting token sales, and draining the funds, which leaves investors with worthless tokens. Current methods either rely on predefined patterns to detect code risks or utilize statistical transaction data to train detection models. However, real-world Rug Pull schemes often involve a complex interplay between malicious code and suspicious transaction behaviors. These methods, which solely focus on one aspect, fall short in detecting such schemes effectively. In this paper, we propose RPHunter, a novel technique that integrates code and transaction for Rug Pull detection. First, RPHunter establishes declarative rules and performs flow analysis to extract code risk information, further constructing a semantic risk code graph (SRCG). Meanwhile, to leverage transaction information, RPHunter formulates dynamic token transaction activities as a token flow behavior graph (TFBG) in which nodes and edges are characterized from network structure and market manipulation perspectives. Finally, RPHunter employs graph neural networks to extract complementary features from SRCG and TFBG, integrating them through an attention fusion model to enhance the detection of Rug Pull. We manually analyzed 645 Rug Pull incidents from code and transaction aspects and constructed a ground-truth dataset. We evaluated RPHunter on our dataset, achieving a precision of 95.3%, a recall of 93.8% and an F1 score of 94.5%, which highlights superior performance compared to existing methods. Furthermore, when applied to the real-world scenarios, RPHunter has identified 4801 Rug Pull tokens, achieving a precision of 90.7%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Focus: Context Extraction for Efficient Code Vulnerability Detection with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17460v2)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models (LMs) show promise for vulnerability detection but struggle with long, real-world code due to sparse and uncertain vulnerability locations. These issues, exacerbated by token limits, often cause models to miss vulnerability-related signals, thereby impairing effective learning. A key intuition is to enhance LMs with concise, information-rich context. Commit-based annotations offer precise, CWE-agnostic supervision, but are unavailable during inference, as they depend on historical code changes. Moreover, their extreme sparsity, often covering only a few lines, makes it difficult for LMs to process directly. In this paper, we propose FocusVul, a model-agnostic framework that improves LM-based vulnerability detection by learning to select sensitive context. FocusVul learns commit-based annotation patterns through hierarchical semantic modeling and generalizes them to identify line-level vulnerability-relevant regions during inference. It then extracts LM-oriented context via both dependency and execution flows surrounding selected regions, yielding semantically rich inputs for effective vulnerability detection. Experiments on real-world benchmarks show that FocusVul consistently outperforms heuristic-based and full-function fine-tuning approaches, improving classification performance by 164.04% and reducing FLOPs by 19.12% on average.</p></details> | <details><summary>withd...</summary><p>withdrawal for fixing errors</p></details> |

However, limitations of LLMs such as irrelevant or incorrect code have highlighted the need for prompt programming (or prompt engineering) where engineers apply specific prompt techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought or input-output examples) to improve the generated code. While some prompt techniques have been studied, the impact of different techniques -- and their interactions -- on code generation is still not fully understood. In this study, we introduce CodePromptEval, a dataset of 7072 prompts designed to evaluate five prompt techniques (few-shot, persona, chain-of-thought, function signature, list of packages) and their effect on the correctness, similarity, and quality of complete functions generated by three LLMs (GPT-4o, Llama3, and Mistral). Our findings show that while certain prompt techniques significantly influence the generated code, combining multiple techniques does not necessarily improve the outcome. Additionally, we observed a trade-off between correctness and quality when using prompt techniques. Our dataset and replication package enable future research on improving LLM-generated code and evaluating new prompt techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Transactions on Software Engineering (TSE).

| **[Differential Coding for Training-Free ANN-to-SNN Conversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00301v3)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit significant potential due to their low energy consumption. Converting Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to SNNs is an efficient way to achieve high-performance SNNs. However, many conversion methods are based on rate coding, which requires numerous spikes and longer time-steps compared to directly trained SNNs, leading to increased energy consumption and latency. This article introduces differential coding for ANN-to-SNN conversion, a novel coding scheme that reduces spike counts and energy consumption by transmitting changes in rate information rather than rates directly, and explores its application across various layers. Additionally, the threshold iteration method is proposed to optimize thresholds based on activation distribution when converting Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) to spiking neurons. Experimental results on various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers demonstrate that the proposed differential coding significantly improves accuracy while reducing energy consumption, particularly when combined with the threshold iteration method, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The source codes of the proposed method are available at https://github.com/h-z-h-cell/ANN-to-SNN-DCGS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lower Bounds for Error Coefficients of Griesmer Optimal Linear Codes via Iteration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05567v1)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The error coefficient of a linear code is defined as the number of minimum-weight codewords. In an additive white Gaussian noise channel, optimal linear codes with the smallest error coefficients achieve the best possible asymptotic frame error rate (AFER) among all optimal linear codes under maximum likelihood decoding. Such codes are referred to as AFER-optimal linear codes. The Griesmer bound is essential for determining the optimality of linear codes. However, establishing tight lower bounds on the error coefficients of Griesmer optimal linear codes is challenging, and the linear programming bound often performs inadequately. In this paper, we propose several iterative lower bounds for the error coefficients of Griesmer optimal linear codes. Specifically, for binary linear codes, our bounds are tight in most cases when the dimension does not exceed $5$. To evaluate the performance of our bounds when they are not tight, we also determine the parameters of the remaining 5-dimensional AFER-optimal linear codes. Our final comparison demonstrates that even when our bounds are not tight, they remain very close to the actual values, with a gap of less than or equal to $2$.</p></details> | 15 pages, 4 tables |

Based on this, N-gram-based watermarking schemes have emerged as prominent, which inject secret watermarks to be detected during the generation. However, their robustness in code content remains insufficiently evaluated. Most claims rely solely on defenses against simple code transformations or code optimizations as a simulation of attack, creating a questionable sense of robustness. In contrast, more sophisticated schemes already exist in the software engineering world, e.g., code obfuscation, which significantly alters code while preserving functionality. Although obfuscation is commonly used to protect intellectual property or evade software scanners, the robustness of code watermarking techniques against such transformations remains largely unexplored. In this work, we formally model the code obfuscation and prove the impossibility of N-gram-based watermarking's robustness with only one intuitive and experimentally verified assumption, distribution consistency, satisfied. Given the original false positive rate of the watermarking detection, the ratio that the detector failed on the watermarked code after obfuscation will increase to 1 - fpr. The experiments have been performed on three SOTA watermarking schemes, two LLMs, two programming languages, four code benchmarks, and four obfuscators. Among them, all watermarking detectors show coin-flipping detection abilities on obfuscated codes (AUROC tightly surrounds 0.5). Among all models, watermarking schemes, and datasets, both programming languages own obfuscators that can achieve attack effects with no detection AUROC higher than 0.6 after the attack. Based on the theoretical and practical observations, we also proposed a potential path of robust code watermarking.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Exception Safety Code Generation with Intermediate Representation Agents Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06949v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often struggle with robust exception handling in generated code, leading to fragile programs that are prone to runtime errors. We propose Seeker, a novel multi-agent framework that enforces exception safety in LLM generated code through an Intermediate Representation (IR) approach. Seeker decomposes exception handling into five specialized agents: Scanner, Detector, Predator, Ranker, and Handler that collaboratively analyze code, detect fragile segments, retrieve best practice exception strategies, and inject robust handling code. We also introduce Common Exception Enumeration (CEE), a comprehensive knowledge base derived from official documentation, technical practices, and real world code, to standardize exception handling strategies. Seeker also incorporates a Deep Retrieval-Augmented Generation (Deep RAG) algorithm to efficiently navigate the exception inheritance hierarchy, cutting down search overhead by 93% while improving accuracy in identifying relevant exceptions. We evaluate Seeker on 15 open source Java projects and multiple benchmarks. Seeker outperforms state of the art baselines, improving exception handling precision by up to 37% and overall code robustness by 38% as measured by expert code review. It significantly closes the gap between LLM and human developers in exception management, achieving a 28% success rate on real world issue fixes (SWE bench) versus 19% by prior methods. Our framework preserves functional correctness of code while proactively handling errors, demonstrating a practical, generalizable solution for safer code generation. In this paper, we discuss the novelty of using intermediate representation and multi-agent collaboration for exception handling, and outline how Seeker can be extended to other programming languages and complex software engineering tasks, aligning LLM-generated code with industrial standard.</p></details> |  |
| **[From LLMs to Actions: Latent Codes as Bridges in Hierarchical Robot Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.04798v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hierarchical control for robotics has long been plagued by the need to have a well defined interface layer to communicate between high-level task planners and low-level policies. With the advent of LLMs, language has been emerging as a prospective interface layer. However, this has several limitations. Not all tasks can be decomposed into steps that are easily expressible in natural language (e.g. performing a dance routine). Further, it makes end-to-end finetuning on embodied data challenging due to domain shift and catastrophic forgetting. We introduce our method -- Learnable Latent Codes as Bridges (LCB) -- as an alternate architecture to overcome these limitations. \method~uses a learnable latent code to act as a bridge between LLMs and low-level policies. This enables LLMs to flexibly communicate goals in the task plan without being entirely constrained by language limitations. Additionally, it enables end-to-end finetuning without destroying the embedding space of word tokens learned during pre-training. Through experiments on Language Table and Calvin, two common language based benchmarks for embodied agents, we find that \method~outperforms baselines (including those w/ GPT-4V) that leverage pure language as the interface layer on tasks that require reasoning and multi-step behaviors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Codes with Addressable and Transversal Non-Clifford Gates](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.01864v3)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of quantum codes with good error correction parameters and useful sets of transversal gates is a problem of major interest in quantum error-correction. Abundant prior works have studied transversal gates which are restricted to acting on all logical qubits simultaneously. In this work, we study codes that support transversal gates which induce $\textit{addressable}$ logical gates, i.e., the logical gates act on logical qubits of our choice. As we consider scaling to high-rate codes, the study and design of low-overhead, addressable logical operations presents an important problem for both theoretical and practical purposes. Our primary result is the construction of an explicit qubit code for which $\textit{any}$ triple of logical qubits across one, two, or three codeblocks can be addressed with a logical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gate via a depth-one circuit of physical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates, and whose parameters are asymptotically good, up to polylogarithmic factors. The result naturally generalizes to other gates including the $\mathsf{C}^{\ell} Z$ gates for $\ell \neq 2$. Going beyond this, we develop a formalism for constructing quantum codes with $\textit{addressable and transversal}$ gates. Our framework, called $\textit{addressable orthogonality}$, encompasses the original triorthogonality framework of Bravyi and Haah (Phys. Rev. A 2012), and extends this and other frameworks to study addressable gates. We demonstrate the power of this framework with the construction of an asymptotically good qubit code for which $\textit{pre-designed}$, pairwise disjoint triples of logical qubits within a single codeblock may be addressed with a logical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gate via a physical depth-one circuit of $\mathsf{Z}$, $\mathsf{CZ}$ and $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates. In an appendix, we show that our framework extends to addressable and transversal $T$ gates, up to Clifford corrections.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cooperative Gradient Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05230v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work studies gradient coding (GC) in the context of distributed training problems with unreliable communication. We propose cooperative GC (CoGC), a novel gradient-sharing-based GC framework that leverages cooperative communication among clients. This approach ultimately eliminates the need for dataset replication, making it both communication- and computation-efficient and suitable for federated learning (FL). By employing the standard GC decoding mechanism, CoGC yields strictly binary outcomes: either the global model is exactly recovered, or the decoding fails entirely, with no intermediate results. This characteristic ensures the optimality of the training and demonstrates strong resilience to client-to-server communication failures when the communication channels among clients are in good condition. However, it may also result in communication inefficiency and hinder convergence due to its lack of flexibility, especially when communication channels among clients are in poor condition. To overcome this limitation and further harness the potential of GC matrices, we propose a complementary decoding mechanism, termed GC$^+$, which leverages information that would otherwise be discarded during GC decoding failures. This approach significantly improves system reliability under unreliable communication, as the full recovery of the global model typically dominates in GC$^+$. To conclude, this work establishes solid theoretical frameworks for both CoGC and GC$^+$. We provide complete outage analyses for each decoding mechanism, along with a rigorous investigation of how outages affect the structure and performance of GC matrices. Building on these analyses, we derive convergence bounds for both decoding mechanisms. Finally, the effectiveness of CoGC and GC$^+$ is validated through extensive simulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Context Learning as an Effective Estimator of Functional Correctness of LLM-Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05200v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When applying LLM-based code generation to software development projects that follow a feature-driven or rapid application development approach, it becomes necessary to estimate the functional correctness of the generated code in the absence of test cases. Just as a user selects a relevant document from a ranked list of retrieved ones, a software generation workflow requires a developer to choose (and potentially refine) a generated solution from a ranked list of alternative solutions, ordered by their posterior likelihoods. This implies that estimating the quality of a ranked list -- akin to estimating "relevance" for query performance prediction (QPP) in IR -- is also crucial for generative software development, where quality is defined in terms of "functional correctness". In this paper, we propose an in-context learning (ICL) based approach for code quality estimation. Our findings demonstrate that providing few-shot examples of functionally correct code from a training set enhances the performance of existing QPP approaches as well as a zero-shot-based approach for code quality estimation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing VLM based approaches struggle with complex educational artifacts, such as programming tasks with executable components and measurable outputs, that require structured reasoning and alignment with clearly defined evaluation criteria. We introduce AGACCI, a multi-agent system that distributes specialized evaluation roles across collaborative agents to improve accuracy, interpretability, and consistency in code-oriented assessment. To evaluate the framework, we collected 360 graduate-level code-based assignments from 60 participants, each annotated by domain experts with binary rubric scores and qualitative feedback. Experimental results demonstrate that AGACCI outperforms a single GPT-based baseline in terms of rubric and feedback accuracy, relevance, consistency, and coherence, while preserving the instructional intent and evaluative depth of expert assessments. Although performance varies across task types, AGACCI highlights the potential of multi-agent systems for scalable and context-aware educational evaluation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025 Workshop on Multi-Agent Systems in the Era of Foundation Models: Opportunities, Challenges and Futures (MAS)</p></details> |

Despite its growing popularity, comprehensive industry standards and peer-reviewed research clarifying its scope and guiding its adoption remain scarce. Aims: This study systematically analyzes existing knowledge and perceptions of EaC, clarifies its scope and boundaries, and provides structured guidance for researchers and practitioners. Method: We conducted a large-scale multivocal literature review (MLR), synthesizing academic and grey literature sources. Findings were analyzed quantitatively and thematically. Based on this analysis, we developed a taxonomy and conceptual model of EaC, validated through collaboration with industry experts. Results: The resulting taxonomy comprises 25 distinct EaC practices organized into six layers based on industry awareness and functional roles. The conceptual model illustrates focus areas, overlaps, and interactions among these EaC practices within the software delivery lifecycle. Additionally, practical code examples demonstrating the implementation of these practices were developed in collaboration with industry experts. Conclusions: This work addresses the current scarcity of academic discourse on EaC by providing the first comprehensive taxonomy and conceptual model. These contributions enhance conceptual clarity, offer actionable guidance to practitioners, and lay the groundwork for future research in this emerging domain.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 19th ACM/IEEE International Symposium on Empirical Software Engineering and Measurement (ESEM 2025), Technical Papers track</p></details> |

This progress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and interactive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap, we introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated, multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through temporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then assessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring. We construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30 leading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking consistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web development, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This establishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the assessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides a high-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often outperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the benchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at https://artifactsbenchmark.github.io/, to provide the community with a scalable and accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative models.</p></details> |  |

Notwithstanding a long history of this metric, research on error-correcting codes under this distance has remained limited. Recently, motivated by applications in DNA-based storage systems, Gabrys \textit{et al} and Wang \texit{et al} reinvigorated interest in this metric. In their works, some codes correcting both deletions and adjacent transpositions were constructed. However, theoretical upper bounds on code sizes under this metric have not yet been established. This paper seeks to establish upper bounds for code sizes in the Damerau-Levenshtein metric.

One of the primary objectives is to construct codes with minimal redundancy. Currently, the best known constructions of $q$-ary codes correcting a burst of at most $t$ deletions ($(\le t)$-burst-deletion correcting codes) achieve redundancy $\log n+8\log\log n+o(\log\log n)$ (for any $q$ and $t$) or $\log n+t\log\log n+O(1)$ (for even $q$). For codes correcting single $t$-localized-deletion ($t$-localized-deletion correcting codes), state-of-the-art constructions attain redundancy $\log n+O\parenv{t(\log\log n)^2}$ (for any $q$ and $t$) or $\log n+2t\log\log n+O(1)$ (for even $q$). Here, $n$ denotes the code-length, and $q$ and $t$ are fixed. These codes employ a position-estimation component to approximate error positions, augmented by additional constraints that enable error-correction given the information about error positions. In this work, we select codewords from the set of sequences whose differential sequences are strong-$(\ell,\epsilon)$-locally-balanced. By imposing a VT-type constraint and an $L_1$-weight constraint on the differential sequences of codewords, we construct novel position-estimation codes. When $q\ge 2$ and $t<q$, or $q$ is even and $t<2q$, this approach gives a $q$-ary $(\le t)$-burst-deletion correcting code and a $t$-localized-deletion correcting code with redundancy $\log n+(t-1)\log\log n+O(1)$. In addition to improving previous redundancy, the method is new and our position-estimation codes are simpler than those in previous works. Finally, we give an efficient encoder to encode an arbitrary input sequence into a sequence whose differential sequence is strong-$(\ell,\epsilon)$-locally-balanced. To our knowledge, no prior algorithm for this specific task has been reported.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted on 2025.06.17</p></details> |

In this paper, we evaluate the capability of existing general LLMs for Basic Linear Algebra Subprograms (BLAS) code generation for CPUs. We use two LLMs provided by OpenAI: GPT-4.1, a Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) model, and o4-mini, one of the o-series of Reasoning models. Both have been released in April 2025. For the routines from level-1 to 3 BLAS, we tried to generate (1) C code without optimization from routine name only, (2) C code with basic performance optimizations (thread parallelization, SIMD vectorization, and cache blocking) from routine name only, and (3) C code with basic performance optimizations based on Fortran reference code. As a result, we found that correct code can be generated in many cases even when only routine name are given. We also confirmed that thread parallelization with OpenMP, SIMD vectorization, and cache blocking can be implemented to some extent, and that the code is faster than the reference code.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 tables |

We show equivalent characterizations for this class of subcodes of the GRS codes being self-dual or near-MDS, which extends the results for $r=1$ in the literature. Along with these characterizations, families of self-dual near-MDS subcodes of the GRS codes are also proposed. Finally, for $r = 1,2$, the dual codes of the subcodes of the GRS codes are found out. In some cases, the subcodes of the GRS codes can be closed under taking dual codes. In other cases, the dual codes turn out to be the twisted GRS codes.</p></details> |  |

A growing body of work has highlighted the emergence of phase codes, a type of oscillatory activity where information is encoded in the relative phase of network activity, in RNNs trained for working memory tasks. However, these studies rely on architectural constraints or regularization schemes that explicitly promote oscillatory solutions. Here, we investigate whether phase coding can emerge purely from task optimization by training continuous-time RNNs to perform a simple modular arithmetic task without oscillatory-promoting biases. We find that in the absence of such biases, RNNs can learn phase code solutions. Surprisingly, we also uncover a rich diversity of alternative solutions that solve our modular arithmetic task via qualitatively distinct dynamics and dynamical mechanisms. We map the solution space for our task and show that the phase code solution occupies a distinct region. These results suggest that phase coding can be a natural but not inevitable outcome of training RNNs on modular arithmetic, and highlight the diversity of solutions RNNs can learn to solve simple tasks.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

However, generating HLS code significantly differs from standard C/C++: it disallows certain coding idioms, relies on specialized libraries, and critically requires fine-grained transformations and the insertion of optimization directives (pragmas) to achieve high performance. Large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating such transformations, yet existing open-source datasets lack sufficient complexity and optimization diversity. To address this gap, we introduce the HLStrans dataset, a comprehensive collection of 137 distinct real word programs, each annotated with a variety of C-to-HLS transformations that yield over 23K labeled design variants. These include a broad spectrum of pragmas and code-level optimizations. We benchmark state-of-the-art LLMs on this dataset to evaluate their ability to generate synthesizable, high-performance HLS code. As part of an ongoing effort, we plan to expand the HLStrans dataset in both scale and program variety, further empowering research at the intersection of AI and hardware synthesis.</p></details> |  |

While classical invariants are effective for Hamming and rank metrics, the sum-rank metric, which unifies both, introduces new challenges. This paper introduces new invariants for sum-rank metric codes: generalised idealisers, the centraliser, the center, and a refined notion of linearity. These lead to the definition of nuclear parameters, inspired by those used in division algebra theory, where they are crucial for proving inequivalence. We also develop a computational framework based on skew polynomials, which is isometric to the classical matrix setting but enables explicit computation of nuclear parameters for known MSRD (Maximum Sum-Rank Distance) codes. This yields a new and effective method to study the code equivalence problem where traditional tools fall short. In fact, using nuclear parameters, we can study the equivalence among the largest families of known MSRD codes.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, traditional positional embeddings employed by these models inadequately capture the hierarchical structure intrinsic to source code, typically represented as Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs). To address this, we propose a novel tree-based positional embedding approach that explicitly encodes hierarchical relationships derived from ASTs, including node depth and sibling indices. These hierarchical embeddings are integrated into the transformer architecture, specifically enhancing the CodeBERTa model. We thoroughly evaluate our proposed model through masked language modeling (MLM) pretraining and clone detection fine-tuning tasks. Experimental results indicate that our Tree-Enhanced CodeBERTa consistently surpasses the baseline model in terms of loss, accuracy, F1 score, precision, and recall, emphasizing the importance of incorporating explicit structural information into transformer-based representations of source code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at "The 1st Joint Workshop on Large Language Models and Structure Modeling"</p></details> |

However, interpretable models often struggle to achieve both accuracy and consistency. Ordinary least squares (OLS) models for high-dimensional regression can be accurate but fail to produce stable regression coefficients over time when using highly granular ICD-10 diagnostic codes as predictors. This instability arises because many ICD-10 codes are infrequent in healthcare datasets. While regularization methods such as Ridge can address this issue, they risk discarding important predictors. Here, we demonstrate that reducing the granularity of ICD-10 codes is an effective regularization strategy within OLS while preserving the representation of all diagnostic code categories. By truncating ICD-10 codes from seven characters (e.g., T67.0XXA, T67.0XXD) to six (e.g., T67.0XX) or fewer, we reduce the dimensionality of the regression problem while maintaining model interpretability and consistency. Mathematically, the merging of predictors in OLS leads to increased trace of the Hessian matrix, which reduces the variance of coefficient estimation. Our findings explain why broader diagnostic groupings like DRGs and HCC codes are favored over highly granular ICD-10 codes in real-world risk adjustment and cost models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to MLHC 2025</p></details> |

A Qualitative Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14341v5)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many toolkit developers seek to streamline the visualization programming process through structured support such as prescribed templates and example galleries. However, few projects examine how users organize their own visualization programs and how their coding choices may deviate from the intents of toolkit developers, impacting visualization prototyping and design. Further, is it possible to infer users' reasoning indirectly through their code, even when users copy code from other sources? We explore this question through a qualitative analysis of 715 D3 programs on Observable. We identify three levels of program organization based on how users decompose their code into smaller blocks: Program-, Chart-, and Component-Level code decomposition, with a strong preference for Component-Level reasoning. In a series of interviews, we corroborate that these levels reflect how Observable users reason about visualization programs. We compare common user-made components with those theorized in the Grammar of Graphics to assess overlap in user and toolkit developer reasoning. We find that, while the Grammar of Graphics covers basic visualizations well, it falls short in describing complex visualization types, especially those with animation, interaction, and parameterization components. Our findings highlight how user practices differ from formal grammars and reinforce ongoing efforts to rethink visualization toolkit support, including augmenting learning tools and AI assistants to better reflect real-world coding strategies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Condi...</summary><p>Conditionally accepted by the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Visualization</p></details> |

We collect pairs of naturalistic and synthetic reasoning tasks to assess the capabilities of Large Language Models (LLM). While naturalistic tasks often require careful human handcrafting, we show that synthetic data is, in many cases, a good proxy that is much easier to collect at scale. We leverage common constructs in programming as the counterpart of the building blocks of naturalistic reasoning tasks, such as straight-line programs, code that contains critical paths, and approximate and redundant instructions. We further assess the capabilities of LLMs on sorting problems and repeated operations via sorting algorithms and nested loops. Our synthetic datasets further reveal that while the most powerful LLMs exhibit relatively strong execution capabilities, the process is fragile: it is negatively affected by memorisation and seems to rely heavily on pattern recognition. Our contribution builds upon synthetically testing the reasoning capabilities of LLMs as a scalable complement to handcrafted human-annotated problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2401.09074 Authors note: this article is a substantial revision of arXiv:2401.09074 (same team) 04/07/2025: We added the Acknowledgments</p></details> |

A Multi-Use Case Study For Prompt Optimization Using DSPy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03620v1)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although prompt engineering is central to unlocking the full potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), crafting effective prompts remains a time-consuming trial-and-error process that relies on human intuition. This study investigates Declarative Self-improving Python (DSPy), an optimization framework that programmatically creates and refines prompts, applied to five use cases: guardrail enforcement, hallucination detection in code, code generation, routing agents, and prompt evaluation. Each use case explores how prompt optimization via DSPy influences performance. While some cases demonstrated modest improvements - such as minor gains in the guardrails use case and selective enhancements in hallucination detection - others showed notable benefits. The prompt evaluation criterion task demonstrated a substantial performance increase, rising accuracy from 46.2% to 64.0%. In the router agent case, the possibility of improving a poorly performing prompt and of a smaller model matching a stronger one through optimized prompting was explored. Although prompt refinement increased accuracy from 85.0% to 90.0%, using the optimized prompt with a cheaper model did not improve performance. Overall, this study's findings suggest that DSPy's systematic prompt optimization can enhance LLM performance, particularly when instruction tuning and example selection are optimized together. However, the impact varies by task, highlighting the importance of evaluating specific use cases in prompt optimization research.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages with 1 figure</p></details> |

We choose a particular class of FSM for research, termed bijective FSM, and observe an explicit polarization loss under bijective FSM. To eliminate the loss, we propose a novel polar coding structure by substituting the last kernel of each layer in polar coding structure with a swapping matrix, thereby termed last-pair swapping structure. We prove that under bijective FSM the proposed structure achieves identical polarization efficiency with that of conventional one on memoryless channels, and exceeds that of conventional one under bijective FSM. Furthermore, we give a plausible generalization of last-pair swapping polar code: on a broader class termed sub-injective FSM. Simulation corroborates that under sub-injective FSM polarization efficiency of the proposed polar code exceeds that of conventional one. And simulation results of error rate are given on continuous phase modulation (CPM) with additional white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, showing a considerable signal-to-noise power ratio (snr) gain of last-pair swapping polar code over conventional one, and identical performances between the proposed polar code under bijective FSM and conventional one on memoryless channels.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures |
| **[High-Level Surface Code Decoding via Parallel FFNNs on CIM Platforms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.18090v2)** | 2025-07-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to the high sensitivity of qubits to environmental noise, which leads to decoherence and information loss, active quantum error correction(QEC) is essential. Surface codes represent one of the most promising fault-tolerant QEC schemes, but they require decoders that are accurate, fast, and scalable to large-scale quantum platforms. In all types of decoders, fully neural network-based high-level decoders offer decoding thresholds that surpass baseline decoder-Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM), and exhibit strong scalability, making them one of the ideal solutions for addressing surface code challenges. However, current fully neural network-based high-level decoders can only operate serially and do not meet the current latency requirements (below 440 ns). To address these challenges, we first propose a parallel fully feedforward neural network (FFNN) high-level surface code decoder, and comprehensively measure its decoding performance on a computing-in-memory (CIM) hardware simulation platform. With the currently available hardware specifications, our work achieves a decoding threshold of 14.22%, surpassing the MWPM baseline of 10.3%, and achieves high pseudo-thresholds of 10.4%, 11.3%, 12%, and 11.6% with decoding latencies of 197.03 ns, 234.87 ns, 243.73 ns, and 251.65 ns for distances of 3, 5, 7 and 9, respectively. The impact of hardware parameters and non-idealities on these results is discussed, and the hardware simulation results are extrapolated to a 4K quantum cryogenic environment.</p></details> | 8 pages, 6 figures |

As generalizations of Hamming weights and Lee weights over $ \mathbb{Z}_{4} $, homogeneous weights are used in codes over finite rings. In this paper, we introduce function-correcting codes with homogeneous distance denoted by FCCHDs, which extend function-correcting codes with Hamming distance. We first define $ D $-homogeneous distance codes. We use $ D $-homogenous distance codes to characterize connections between the optimal redundancy of FCCHDs and lengths of these codes for some matrices $ D $. By these connections, we obtain several bounds of the optimal redundancy of FCCHDs for some functions. In addition, we also construct FCCHDs for homogeneous weight functions and homogeneous weight distribution functions. Specially, redundancies of some codes we construct in this paper reach the optimal redundancy bounds.</p></details> |  |

We introduce two openly licensed datasets, released under the Llama 3.3 Community License, that significantly enhance LLM performance by systematically rewriting public data. SwallowCode (approximately 16.1 billion tokens) refines Python snippets from The-Stack-v2 through a novel four-stage pipeline: syntax validation, pylint-based style filtering, and a two-stage LLM rewriting process that enforces style conformity and transforms snippets into self-contained, algorithmically efficient examples. Unlike prior methods that rely on exclusionary filtering or limited transformations, our transform-and-retain approach upgrades low-quality code, maximizing data utility. SwallowMath (approximately 2.3 billion tokens) enhances Finemath-4+ by removing boilerplate, restoring context, and reformatting solutions into concise, step-by-step explanations. Within a fixed 50 billion token training budget, continual pre-training of Llama-3.1-8B with SwallowCode boosts pass@1 by +17.0 on HumanEval and +17.7 on HumanEval+ compared to Stack-Edu, surpassing the baseline model's code generation capabilities. Similarly, substituting SwallowMath yields +12.4 accuracy on GSM8K and +7.6 on MATH. Ablation studies confirm that each pipeline stage contributes incrementally, with rewriting delivering the largest gains. All datasets, prompts, and checkpoints are publicly available, enabling reproducible research and advancing LLM pre-training for specialized domains.</p></details> |  |

This invariant helps to investigate both the algebraic and geometric complexity of line bundles through discrete stepwise constructions. We study some of its basic properties, including functorial behavior under restriction to curves and compatibility with ampleness and base-point freeness. Applying this framework to algebraic geometry (AG) codes, we show that hierarchical filtrations yield natural code families whose combinatorial parameters (dimension, minimum distance) evolve predictably across the filtration.</p></details> | Comments are welcome |
| **[Amortized Locally Decodable Codes for Insertions and Deletions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03141v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Locally Decodable Codes (LDCs) are error correcting codes which permit the recovery of any single message symbol with a low number of queries to the codeword (the locality). Traditional LDC tradeoffs between the rate, locality, and error tolerance are undesirable even in relaxed settings where the encoder/decoder share randomness or where the channel is resource-bounded. Recent work by Blocki and Zhang initiated the study of Hamming amortized Locally Decodable Codes (aLDCs), which allow the local decoder to amortize their number of queries over the recovery of a small subset of message symbols. Surprisingly, Blocki and Zhang construct asymptotically ideal (constant rate, constant amortized locality, and constant error tolerance) Hamming aLDCs in private-key and resource-bounded settings. While this result overcame previous barriers and impossibility results for Hamming LDCs, it is not clear whether the techniques extend to Insdel LDCs. Constructing Insdel LDCs which are resilient to insertion and/or deletion errors is known to be even more challenging. Our first contribution is to provide a Hamming-to-Insdel compiler which transforms any amortized Hamming LDC that satisfies a particular property to amortized Insdel LDC while asymptotically preserving the rate, error tolerance and amortized locality. Prior Hamming-to-Insdel compilers worked for arbitrary Hamming LDCs, but incurred an undesirable polylogarithmic blow-up in the locality. Our second contribution is a construction of an ideal amortized Hamming LDC which satisfies our special property in the relaxed settings where the sender/receiver share randomness or where the channel is resource bounded. Taken together, we obtain ideal Insdel aLDCs in private-key and resource-bounded settings with constant amortized locality, constant rate and constant error tolerance.</p></details> |  |

However, many impactful applications demand quantum computations with millions of logical qubits, necessitating highly scalable quantum error correction. In classical information theory, low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes can approach channel capacity efficiently. Yet, no quantum error-correcting codes with efficient decoding have been shown to approach the hashing bound - a fundamental limit on quantum capacity - despite decades of research. Here, we present quantum LDPC codes that not only approach the hashing bound but also allow decoding with computational cost linear in the number of physical qubits. This breakthrough paves the way for large-scale, fault-tolerant quantum computation. Combined with emerging hardware that manages many qubits, our approach brings quantum solutions to important real-world problems significantly closer to reality.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to a journal for possible publication</p></details> |

However, high-quality vision-language reasoning data is expensive and labor-intensive to annotate. To address this issue, we leverage a promising resource: game code, which naturally contains logical structures and state transition processes. Therefore, we propose Code2Logic, a novel game-code-driven approach for multimodal reasoning data synthesis. Our approach leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to adapt game code, enabling automatic acquisition of reasoning processes and results through code execution. Using the Code2Logic approach, we developed the GameQA dataset to train and evaluate VLMs. GameQA is cost-effective and scalable, offers controllable difficulty gradation and is diverse with 30 games and 158 tasks. Surprisingly, despite training solely on game data, VLMs demonstrated out of domain generalization, specifically Qwen2.5-VL-7B improving performance by 2.33% across 7 diverse vision-language benchmarks.

Using Large Language Models for Coding German Open-Ended Survey Responses on Survey Motivation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14634v3)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development and wider accessibility of LLMs have spurred discussions about how they can be used in survey research, including classifying open-ended survey responses. Due to their linguistic capacities, it is possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual coding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models. As most existing research on this topic has focused on English-language responses relating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its findings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to established methods. In this study, we investigate to what extent different LLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using German data on reasons for survey participation as an example. We compare several state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate the LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. Overall performance differs greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory levels of predictive performance. Performance differences between prompting approaches are conditional on the LLM used. Finally, LLMs' unequal classification performance across different categories of reasons for survey participation results in different categorical distributions when not using fine-tuning. We discuss the implications of these findings, both for methodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their substantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively analyzing such data. Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need to consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response classification in the age of LLMs. In doing so, our study contributes to the growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be efficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in Survey Research Methods</p></details> |

A code digital twin is constructed using a methodology that combines knowledge extraction from both structured and unstructured sources--such as source code, documentation, and change histories--leveraging LLMs, static analysis tools, and human expertise. This framework can empower LLMs for software maintenance tasks such as issue localization and repository-level code generation by providing tacit knowledge as contexts.

Current methods primarily enhance model performance by leveraging vast amounts of data, focusing on data quantity while often overlooking data quality, thereby reducing training efficiency. To address this, we introduce an approach that utilizes a parametric model for code data selection, aimed at improving both training efficiency and model performance. Our method optimizes the parametric model to ensure distribution consistency and diversity within the selected subset, guaranteeing high-quality data. Experimental results demonstrate that using only 10K samples, our method achieves gains of 2.4% (HumanEval) and 2.3% (MBPP) over 92K full-sampled baseline, outperforming other sampling approaches in both performance and efficiency. This underscores that our method effectively boosts model performance while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> |  |

Different from the conventional SC-TCs, the proposed codes have simpler and deterministic coupling structures. Most notably, the coupling of HSC-BCCs is performed by re-encoding the whole coupling sequence in the component encoder of one time instant, rather than spreading the coupling bits to component encoders of multiple time instants. This simplification not only addresses the window decoding threshold loss issue in existing BCCs, but also allows the proposed codes to attain very close-to-capacity performance with a coupling memory as small as 2. Both theoretical and numerical results are provided to demonstrate the performance advantages of the proposed codes over existing spatially coupled codes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of conference paper "Half Spatially Coupled Turbo-Like Codes" accepted by 2025 IEEE Information Theory Workshop</p></details> |

These applications require understanding beyond surface-level code patterns: value propagation, control flow, and interdependence between program elements. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate end-to-end outcomes, such as whether code is correctly repaired or generated, leaving the models ability for program semantic reasoning underexplored. This work presents CoRe, a high-quality, human-verified benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on fundamental static analysis tasks. CoRe includes 12,553 task instances spanning data dependency, control dependency, and information flow across programs written in C/C++, Java, and Python. To ensure semantic diversity and reasoning complexity, we propose a semantics-aware diverse sampling strategy that selects targets and task instances based on structural coverage and dependency depth. We evaluate 10 mainstream LLMs and show that, while they perform well at identifying dependencies, models still struggle with tasks that require deeper semantic understanding and multi-step reasoning. We further conduct qualitative analyses to uncover key challenges, such as complex control structures and backward dependency patterns, offering insights into improving LLMs code reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[DecoRTL: A Run-time Decoding Framework for RTL Code Generation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02226v1)** | 2025-07-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As one of their many applications, large language models (LLMs) have recently shown promise in automating register transfer level (RTL) code generation. However, conventional LLM decoding strategies, originally designed for natural language, often fail to meet the structural and semantic demands of RTL, leading to hallucinated, repetitive, or invalid code outputs. In this paper, we first investigate the root causes of these decoding failures through an empirical analysis of token-level entropy during RTL generation. Our findings reveal that LLMs exhibit low confidence in regions of structural ambiguity or semantic complexity, showing that standard decoding strategies fail to differentiate between regions requiring determinism (syntax-critical regions) and those that benefit from creative exploratory variability (design-critical regions). Then, to overcome this, we introduce DecoRTL, a novel run-time decoding strategy, that is both syntax-aware and contrastive for RTL code generation. DecoRTL integrates two complementary components: (i) self-consistency sampling, which generates multiple candidates and re-ranks them based on token-level agreement to promote correctness while maintaining diversity; and (ii) syntax-aware temperature adaptation, which classifies tokens by their syntactical and functional roles and adjusts the sampling temperature accordingly, enforcing low temperature for syntax-critical tokens and higher temperature for exploratory ones. Our approach operates entirely at inference time without requiring any additional model fine-tuning.

Due to its age, complexity, and declining number of COBOL developers, maintaining COBOL codebases is becoming increasingly challenging. In particular, the lack of documentation makes it difficult for new developers to effectively understand and maintain COBOL systems. Existing research utilizes large language models (LLMs) to explain the functionality of code snippets. However, COBOL presents unique challenges due to its architectural and syntactical differences, which often cause its code to exceed the token window size of LLMs. In this work, we propose a multi-agent approach that leverages two LLM-based agents working collaboratively to generate explanations for functions, files, and the overall project. These agents incorporate together by utilizing contextual information from the codebase into the code explanation prompts. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach using 14 open-source, real-world COBOL projects. Our results indicate that our approach performs significantly better than the baseline in function code explanation, with improvements of 12.67%, 18.59%, and 0.62% in terms of METEOR, chrF, and SentenceBERT scores, respectively. At the file level, our approach effectively explains both short and long COBOL files that exceed the token window size of LLMs and surpass the baseline by 4.21%, 10.72%, and 14.68% in explaining the purpose, functionality, and clarity of the generated explanation. At the project level, our approach generates explanations that convey the functionality and purpose of 82% of the selected projects.</p></details> |  |
| **[DSCodeBench: A Realistic Benchmark for Data Science Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15621v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce DSCodeBench, a new benchmark designed to evaluate large language models (LLMs) on complicated and realistic data science code generation tasks. DSCodeBench consists of 1,000 carefully constructed problems sourced from realistic problems from GitHub across ten widely used Python data science libraries. Compared to the current state-of-the-art benchmark DS-1000, DSCodeBench offers a more challenging and representative testbed, longer code solutions, more comprehensive data science libraries, clearer and better structured problem descriptions, and stronger test suites. To construct the DSCodeBench, we develop a robust pipeline that combines task scope selection, code construction, test case generation, and problem description synthesis. The process is paired with rigorous manual editing to ensure alignment and enhance evaluation reliability. Experimental result shows that DSCodeBench exhibits robust scaling behavior, where larger models systematically outperform smaller ones, validating its ability to distinguish model capabilities. The best LLM we test, GPT-4o, has a pass@1 of 0.202, indicating that LLMs still have a large room to improve for realistic data science code generation tasks. We believe DSCodeBench will serve as a rigorous and trustworthy foundation for advancing LLM-based data science programming.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM-based Quantum Code Generation with Multi-Agent Optimization and Quantum Error Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14557v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent frameworks with Large Language Models (LLMs) have become promising tools for generating general-purpose programming languages using test-driven development, allowing developers to create more accurate and robust code. However, their potential has not been fully unleashed for domain-specific programming languages, where specific domain exhibits unique optimization opportunities for customized improvement. In this paper, we take the first step in exploring multi-agent code generation for quantum programs. By identifying the unique optimizations in quantum designs such as quantum error correction, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework tailored to generating accurate, fault-tolerant quantum code. Each agent in the framework focuses on distinct optimizations, iteratively refining the code using a semantic analyzer with multi-pass inference, alongside an error correction code decoder. We also examine the effectiveness of inference-time techniques, like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in the context of quantum programming, uncovering observations that are different from general-purpose code generation. To evaluate our approach, we develop a test suite to measure the impact each optimization has on the accuracy of the generated code. Our findings indicate that techniques such as structured CoT significantly improve the generation of quantum algorithms by up to 50%. In contrast, we have also found that certain techniques such as RAG show limited improvement, yielding an accuracy increase of only 4%. Moreover, we showcase examples of AI-assisted quantum error prediction and correction, demonstrating the effectiveness of our multi-agent framework in reducing the quantum errors of generated quantum programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted by DAC'25</p></details> |
| **[Structural Code Search using Natural Language Queries](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02107v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Searching code is a common task that developers perform to understand APIs, learn common code patterns, and navigate code. Currently, developers most commonly search using keywords and regular expressions that are easy to use and widely available. Beyond keywords and regular expressions, structural code search tools allow developers to search for code based on its syntactic structure. This has numerous applications ranging from bug finding to systematically refactoring code. However, these structural code search tools operate on queries expressed in domain-specific languages (DSL) that can be difficult to learn and write. We propose to allow developers to use natural language to search for code structurally. Expressing queries in natural language provides an intuitive way to search for code and lowers the barrier to entry. In this work, we develop a novel general approach that combines the reasoning capabilities of an LLM to interpret natural language search queries with the power of structural search tools to efficiently and accurately retrieve relevant code. We then instantiate this approach for two structural code search DSLs: Semgrep and GQL. In our evaluation, we construct a new benchmark for structural code search consisting of 400 queries over 10 Java projects. We show that our approach for structural code search based on translating NL queries to DSL queries using an LLM is effective and robust, achieving a high precision and recall ranging from 55% - 70%. Further, our approach significantly outperforms baselines based on semantic code search and LLM retrievals by up to 57% and 14% on F1 scores.</p></details> |  |
| **[KeyNode-Driven Geometry Coding for Real-World Scanned Human Dynamic Mesh Compression](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.01717v2)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The compression of real-world scanned 3D human dynamic meshes is an emerging research area, driven by applications such as telepresence, virtual reality, and 3D digital streaming. Unlike synthesized dynamic meshes with fixed topology, scanned dynamic meshes often not only have varying topology across frames but also scan defects such as holes and outliers, increasing the complexity of prediction and compression. Additionally, human meshes often combine rigid and non-rigid motions, making accurate prediction and encoding significantly more difficult compared to objects that exhibit purely rigid motion. To address these challenges, we propose a compression method designed for real-world scanned human dynamic meshes, leveraging embedded key nodes. The temporal motion of each vertex is formulated as a distance-weighted combination of transformations from neighboring key nodes, requiring the transmission of solely the key nodes' transformations. To enhance the quality of the KeyNode-driven prediction, we introduce an octree-based residual coding scheme and a Dual-direction prediction mode, which uses I-frames from both directions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves significant improvements over the state-of-the-art, with an average bitrate savings of 58.43% across the evaluated sequences, particularly excelling at low bitrates.</p></details> |  |

For this task, transparency plays an important role for medical coders and regulatory bodies, which can be achieved using explainability methods. However, the evaluation of these approaches has been mostly limited to short text and binary settings due to a scarcity of annotated data. Recent efforts by Cheng et al. (2023) have introduced the MDACE dataset, which provides a valuable resource containing code evidence in clinical records. In this work, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the MDACE dataset and perform plausibility evaluation of current explainable medical coding systems from an applied perspective. With this, we contribute to a deeper understanding of automatic medical coding and evidence extraction. Our findings reveal that ground truth evidence aligns with code descriptions to a certain degree. An investigation into state-of-the-art approaches shows a high overlap with ground truth evidence. We propose match measures and highlight success and failure cases. Based on our findings, we provide recommendations for developing and evaluating explainable medical coding systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[Perception-Oriented Latent Coding for High-Performance Compressed Domain Semantic Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01608v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, compressed domain semantic inference has primarily relied on learned image coding models optimized for mean squared error (MSE). However, MSE-oriented optimization tends to yield latent spaces with limited semantic richness, which hinders effective semantic inference in downstream tasks. Moreover, achieving high performance with these models often requires fine-tuning the entire vision model, which is computationally intensive, especially for large models. To address these problems, we introduce Perception-Oriented Latent Coding (POLC), an approach that enriches the semantic content of latent features for high-performance compressed domain semantic inference. With the semantically rich latent space, POLC requires only a plug-and-play adapter for fine-tuning, significantly reducing the parameter count compared to previous MSE-oriented methods. Experimental results demonstrate that POLC achieves rate-perception performance comparable to state-of-the-art generative image coding methods while markedly enhancing performance in vision tasks, with minimal fine-tuning overhead.

However, in the factory automation sector, particularly motion control, manual programming, alongside inefficient and unsafe debugging practices, remains prevalent. This stems from the complex interplay of mechanical and electrical systems and stringent safety requirements. Moreover, most current AI-assisted motion control programming efforts focus on PLCs, with little attention given to high-level languages and function libraries. To address these challenges, we introduce MCCoder, an LLM-powered system tailored for generating motion control code, integrated with a soft-motion controller. MCCoder improves code generation through a structured workflow that combines multitask decomposition, hybrid retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and iterative self-correction, utilizing a well-established motion library. Additionally, it integrates a 3D simulator for intuitive motion validation and logs of full motion trajectories for data verification, significantly enhancing accuracy and safety. In the absence of benchmark datasets and metrics tailored for evaluating motion control code generation, we propose MCEVAL, a dataset spanning motion tasks of varying complexity. Experiments show that MCCoder outperforms baseline models using Advanced RAG, achieving an overall performance gain of 33.09% and a 131.77% improvement on complex tasks in the MCEVAL dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE CASE 2025 Best Student Paper Finalists</p></details> |

However, its application to the fading channel with imperfect CSI at the transmitter (I-CSIT) is challenging since the SK scheme is sensitive to the CSI. In this paper, we investigate how to design SK-type scheme for the quasi-static fading channel with I-CSIT and quantized feedback. By introducing modulo lattice function and an auxiliary signal into the SK-type encoder-decoder of the transceiver, we show that the decoding error caused by the I-CSIT can be perfectly eliminated, resulting in the success of designing SK-type scheme for such a case. The study of this paper provides a way to design efficient coding scheme for fading channels in the presence of imperfect CSI and quantized feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, conference, this paper will be presented at the 2025 IEEE ITW</p></details> |

In contrast, most visual representation learning systems use fixed-length representations for all inputs, ignoring variations in complexity or familiarity. Recent adaptive tokenization methods address this by allocating variable-length representations but typically require test-time search over multiple encodings to find the most predictive one. Inspired by Kolmogorov Complexity principles, we propose a single-pass adaptive tokenizer, KARL, which predicts the appropriate number of tokens for an image in a single forward pass, halting once its approximate KC is reached. The token count serves as a proxy for the minimum description length. KARL's training procedure closely resembles the Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning paradigm, as it learns to conditionally predict token halting based on a desired reconstruction quality. KARL matches the performance of recent adaptive tokenizers while operating in a single pass. We present scaling laws for KARL, analyzing the role of encoder/decoder size, continuous vs. discrete tokenization and more. Additionally, we offer a conceptual study drawing an analogy between Adaptive Image Tokenization and Algorithmic Information Theory, examining the predicted image complexity (KC) across axes such as structure vs. noise and in- vs. out-of-distribution familiarity -- revealing alignment with human intuition.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code at: https://github.com/ShivamDuggal4/karl Keywords: Representation Learning, Adaptive Tokenization, Compression, Algorithmic Information Theory, Kolmogorov Complexity, Upside-Down RL</p></details> |

| **[Combinatorial Algorithm for Tropical Linearly Factorized Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07596v1)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tropical semiring is a set of numbers $\mathbb{R}\cup\{-\infty\}$ with addition $a\oplus b:=\max(a,b)$ and multiplication $a\otimes b:=a+b$. As well as in conventional algebra, linear programming problem in the tropical semiring has been developed. In this study, we introduce a new type of tropical optimization problem, namely, tropical linearly factorized programming problem. This problem involves minimizing the objective function given by the product of tropical linear forms $c_{k,1}\otimes x_1\oplus \cdots\oplus c_{k,n}\otimes x_n$ divided by a tropical monomial, subject to tropical linear inequality constraints. The objective function is convex in the conventional sense but not in the tropical sense, while the feasible set is convex in the tropical sense but not in the conventional sense. Our algorithm for tropical linearly factorized programming is based on the descent method and exploits tangent digraphs. First, we demonstrate that the feasible descent direction at the current solution can be obtained by solving the minimum $s$-$t$ cut problem on a specific subgraph of the tangent digraph. Although exponentially many such digraphs may exist in general, a more efficient algorithm is devised in cases where the problem is non-degenerate. Focusing on the fact that tangent digraphs become spanning trees in non-degenerate cases, we present a simplex-like algorithm that updates the tree structure iteratively. We show that each iteration can be executed in $O(r_A+r_C)$ time, where $r_A$ and $r_C$ are the numbers of ``non-zero'' coefficients in the linear constraints and objective function, respectively. For integer instances, our algorithm finds a local optimum in $O((m+n)(r_A+r_C)MD)$ time, where $n$ and $m$ are the number of decision variables and constraints, respectively, $M$ is the maximum absolute value of coefficients and $D$ is the degree of the objective function.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modular Reasoning about Error Bounds for Concurrent Probabilistic Programs (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04512v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Coneris, the first higher-order concurrent separation logic for reasoning about error probability bounds of higher-order concurrent probabilistic programs with higher-order state. To support modular reasoning about concurrent (non-probabilistic) program modules, state-of-the-art program logics internalize the classic notion of linearizability within the logic through the concept of logical atomicity. Coneris extends this idea to probabilistic concurrent program modules. Thus Coneris supports modular reasoning about probabilistic concurrent modules by capturing a novel notion of randomized logical atomicity within the logic. To do so, Coneris utilizes presampling tapes and a novel probabilistic update modality to describe how state is changed probabilistically at linearization points. We demonstrate this approach by means of smaller synthetic examples and larger case studies. All of the presented results, including the meta-theory, have been mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant and the Iris separation logic framework</p></details> |  |

However, if we abstract away the semantics of statements, then this problem becomes not just decidable, but practically feasible. For instance, a program of the form "if $b$ then $e$ else $f$" should be equivalent to "if not $b$ then $f$ else $e$" - no matter what $b$, $e$ and $f$ are. This kind of equivalence is known as propositional equivalence. In this extended abstract, we discuss recent developments in propositional program equivalence from the perspective of (Guarded) Kleene Algebra with Tests, or (G)KAT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraint Programming Models For Serial Batch Scheduling With Minimum Batch Size](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08793v2)** | 2025-07-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In serial batch (s-batch) scheduling, jobs are grouped in batches and processed sequentially within their batch. This paper considers multiple parallel machines, nonidentical job weights and release times, and sequence-dependent setup times between batches of different families. Although s-batch has been widely studied in the literature, very few papers have taken into account a minimum batch size, typical in practical settings such as semiconductor manufacturing and the metal industry. The problem with this minimum batch size requirement has been mostly tackled with dynamic programming and meta-heuristics, and no article has ever used constraint programming (CP) to do so. This paper fills this gap by proposing, three CP models for s-batching with minimum batch size: (i) an \textit{Interval Assignment} model that computes and bounds the size of the batches using the presence literals of interval variables of the jobs. (ii) A \textit{Global} model that exclusively uses global constraints that track the size of the batches over time. (iii) And a \textit{Hybrid} model that combines the benefits of the extra global constraints with the efficiency of the sum-of-presences constraints to ensure the minimum batch sizes. The computational experiments on standard cases compare the three CP models with two existing mixed-integer programming (MIP) models from the literature. The results demonstrate the versatility of the proposed CP models to handle multiple variations of s-batching; and their ability to produce, in large instances, better solutions than the MIP models faster.</p></details> | 18 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Planning Anything with Rigor: General-Purpose Zero-Shot Planning with LLM-based Formalized Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.12112v3)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated strong potential in solving planning problems, there is a trade-off between flexibility and complexity. LLMs, as zero-shot planners themselves, are still not capable of directly generating valid plans for complex planning problems such as multi-constraint or long-horizon tasks. On the other hand, many frameworks aiming to solve complex planning problems often rely on task-specific preparatory efforts, such as task-specific in-context examples and pre-defined critics/verifiers, which limits their cross-task generalization capability. In this paper, we tackle these challenges by observing that the core of many planning problems lies in optimization problems: searching for the optimal solution (best plan) with goals subject to constraints (preconditions and effects of decisions). With LLMs' commonsense, reasoning, and programming capabilities, this opens up the possibilities of a universal LLM-based approach to planning problems. Inspired by this observation, we propose LLMFP, a general-purpose framework that leverages LLMs to capture key information from planning problems and formally formulate and solve them as optimization problems from scratch, with no task-specific examples needed. We apply LLMFP to 9 planning problems, ranging from multi-constraint decision making to multi-step planning problems, and demonstrate that LLMFP achieves on average 83.7% and 86.8% optimal rate across 9 tasks for GPT-4o and Claude 3.5 Sonnet, significantly outperforming the best baseline (direct planning with OpenAI o1-preview) with 37.6% and 40.7% improvements. We also validate components of LLMFP with ablation experiments and analyzed the underlying success and failure reasons.

We show that our proposed representation results in the various paradoxes of deontic modal logic being elegantly resolved.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fractional Programming for Stochastic Precoding over Generalized Fading Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06944v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper seeks an efficient algorithm for stochastic precoding to maximize the long-term average weighted sum rates throughout a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) network. Unlike many existing works that assume a particular probability distribution model for fading channels (which is typically Gaussian), our approach merely relies on the first and second moments of fading channels. For the stochastic precoding problem, a naive idea is to directly apply the fractional programming (FP) method to the data rate inside the expectation; it does not work well because the auxiliary variables introduced by FP are then difficult to decide. To address the above issue, we propose using a lower bound to approximate the expectation of data rate. This lower bound stems from a nontrivial use of the matrix FP, and outperforms the existing lower bounds in that it accounts for generalized fading channels whose first and second moments are known. The resulting approximate problem can be efficiently solved in closed form in an iterative fashion. Furthermore, for large-scale MIMO, we improve the efficiency of the proposed algorithm by eliminating the large matrix inverse. Simulations show that the proposed stochastic precoding method outperforms the benchmark methods in both Gaussian and non-Gaussian fading channel cases.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[Sound Interval-Based Synthesis for Probabilistic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.06939v1)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic programming has become a standard practice to model stochastic events and learn about the behavior of nature in different scientific contexts, ranging from Genetics and Ecology to Linguistics and Psychology. However, domain practitioners (such as biologists) also need to be experts in statistics in order to select which probabilistic model is suitable for a given particular problem, relying then on probabilistic inference engines such as Stan, Pyro or Edward to fine-tune the parameters of that particular model. Probabilistic Programming would be more useful if the model selection is made automatic, without requiring statistics expertise from the end user. Automatically selecting the model is challenging because of the large search space of probabilistic programs needed to be explored, because the fact that most of that search space contains invalid programs, and because invalid programs may only be detected in some executions, due to its probabilistic nature. We propose a type system to statically reject invalid probabilistic programs, a type-directed synthesis algorithm that guarantees that generated programs are type-safe by construction, and an heuristic search procedure to handle the vast search space. We collect a number of probabilistic programs from the literature, and use them to compare our method with both a type-agnostic random search, and a data-guided method from the literature (DaPPer). Our results show that our technique both outperforms random search and DaPPer, specially on more complex programs. This drastic performance difference in synthesis allows for fast sampling of programs and enables techniques that previously suffered from the complexity of synthesis, such as Genetic Programming, to be applied.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimizing Multiple-Control Toffoli Quantum Circuit Design with Constraint Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.14384v3)** | 2025-07-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As quantum technology advances, the efficient design of quantum circuits has become an important area of research. This paper provides an introduction to the MCT quantum circuit design problem for reversible Boolean functions with the necessary background in quantum computing to comprehend the problem. While this is a well-studied problem, optimization models that minimize the true objective have only been explored recently. This paper introduces a new optimization model and symmetry-breaking constraints that improve solving time by up to two orders of magnitude compared to earlier work when a Constraint Programming solver is used. Experiments with up to seven qubits and using up to 15 quantum gates result in several new best-known circuits, obtained by any method, for well-known benchmarks. Several in-depth analyses are presented to validate the effectiveness of the symmetry-breaking constraints from multiple perspectives. Finally, an extensive comparison with other approaches shows that optimization models may require more time but can provide superior circuits with optimality guarantees.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Dynamic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/1706.00834v4)** | 2025-07-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a general method for combinatorial online learning problems whose offline optimization problem can be solved efficiently via a dynamic programming algorithm defined by an arbitrary min-sum recurrence. Examples include online learning of Binary Search Trees, Matrix-Chain Multiplications, $k$-sets, Knapsacks, Rod Cuttings, and Weighted Interval Schedulings. For each of these problems we use the underlying graph of subproblems (called a multi-DAG) for defining a representation of the solutions of the dynamic programming problem by encoding them as a generalized version of paths (called multipaths). These multipaths encode each solution as a series of successive decisions or components over which the loss is linear. We then show that the dynamic programming algorithm for each problem leads to online algorithms for learning multipaths in the underlying multi-DAG. The algorithms maintain a distribution over the multipaths in a concise form as their hypothesis. More specifically we generalize the existing Expanded Hedge and Component Hedge algorithms for the online shortest path problem to learning multipaths. Additionally, we introduce a new and faster prediction technique for Component Hedge which in our case directly samples from a distribution over multipaths, bypassing the need to decompose the distribution over multipaths into a mixture with small support.</p></details> |  |

However, enhancing data quality at scale remains a significant challenge, primarily due to the trade-off between refinement effectiveness and processing efficiency. While rule-based filtering remains the dominant paradigm, it typically operates at the document level and lacks the granularity needed to refine specific content within documents. Inspired by emerging work such as ProX, we propose $\textbf{RefineX}$, a novel framework for large-scale, surgical refinement of pre-training data through programmatic editing tasks. RefineX enables efficient and fine-grained data refinement while reliably preserving the diversity and naturalness of raw text. The core strength of RefineX lies in distilling high-quality, expert-guided end-to-end refinement results into minimal edit-based deletion programs. This high-precision distillation pipeline is used to train an efficient and reliable refine model that can systematically improve every instance in the corpus at scale. We evaluate RefineX across from-scratch pre-training at multiple model scales and find that it consistently outperforms models trained on raw, filtered, or alternatively refined data across diverse downstream tasks. On the 750M model, RefineX yields 2.6%-7.2% average gains on lighteval tasks, and achieves comparable performance using significantly fewer training tokens. Further analysis shows that RefineX reliably enhances text quality with both high efficiency and precision, outperforming prior approaches such as end-to-end generation and Prox-C. These results position RefineX as a scalable, effective, and reliable solution for optimizing pre-training data in modern LLM pipelines.</p></details> |  |

However, limitations of LLMs such as irrelevant or incorrect code have highlighted the need for prompt programming (or prompt engineering) where engineers apply specific prompt techniques (e.g., chain-of-thought or input-output examples) to improve the generated code. While some prompt techniques have been studied, the impact of different techniques -- and their interactions -- on code generation is still not fully understood. In this study, we introduce CodePromptEval, a dataset of 7072 prompts designed to evaluate five prompt techniques (few-shot, persona, chain-of-thought, function signature, list of packages) and their effect on the correctness, similarity, and quality of complete functions generated by three LLMs (GPT-4o, Llama3, and Mistral). Our findings show that while certain prompt techniques significantly influence the generated code, combining multiple techniques does not necessarily improve the outcome. Additionally, we observed a trade-off between correctness and quality when using prompt techniques.

In particular, we extend known result of Caminada, Schultz and Toni by showing that assumption-based argumentation can represent not only normal logic programs, but also disjunctive logic programs and their extensions. For this, we consider some inference rules for disjunction that the core logic of the argumentation frameworks should respect, and show the correspondence to the handling of disjunctions in the heads of the logic programs' rules.

Although domain-specific languages like Triton simplify GPU programming by abstracting low-level details, developers must still manually tune critical parameters such as tile sizes and memory access patterns through iterative experimentation, creating substantial barriers to optimal performance and wider adoption. In this work, we introduce AutoTriton, the first model dedicated to Triton programming powered by reinforcement learning (RL). AutoTriton performs supervised fine-tuning (SFT) to be equipped with essential Triton programming expertise using a high-quality data gathering pipeline, and conducts RL with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) algorithm, combining a rule-based reward and an execution-based reward to further improve Triton programming ability, sequentially. Experiments across five evaluation channels of TritonBench and KernelBench illustrate that our 8B model AutoTriton achieves performance comparable to mainstream large models, including Claude-4-Sonnet and DeepSeek-R1-0528. Further experimental analysis demonstrates the crucial role of each module within AutoTriton, including the SFT stage, the RL stage, and the reward design strategy. These findings underscore the promise of RL for automatically generating high-performance kernels, and since high-performance kernels are core components of AI systems, this breakthrough establishes an important foundation for building more efficient AI systems. The model and code will be available at https://github.com/AI9Stars/AutoTriton.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Rules Represent Causal Knowledge: Causal Modeling with Abductive Logic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.05088v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pearl observes that causal knowledge enables predicting the effects of interventions, such as actions, whereas descriptive knowledge only permits drawing conclusions from observation. This paper extends Pearl's approach to causality and interventions to the setting of stratified abductive logic programs. It shows how stable models of such programs can be given a causal interpretation by building on philosophical foundations and recent work by Bochman and Eelink et al. In particular, it provides a translation of abductive logic programs into causal systems, thereby clarifying the informal causal reading of logic program rules and supporting principled reasoning about external actions. The main result establishes that the stable model semantics for stratified programs conforms to key philosophical principles of causation, such as causal sufficiency, natural necessity, and irrelevance of unobserved effects. This justifies the use of stratified abductive logic programs as a framework for causal modeling and for predicting the effects of interventions</p></details> |  |
| **[AI for the Routine, Humans for the Complex: Accuracy-Driven Data Labelling with Mixed Integer Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04990v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The scarcity of accurately labelled data remains a major challenge in deep learning (DL). Many DL approaches rely on semi-supervised methods, which focus on constructing large datasets that require only a minimal amount of human-labelled data. Since DL training algorithms can tolerate moderate label noise, it has generally been acceptable for the accuracy of labels in large training datasets to fall well short of a perfect 100%. However, when it comes to testing DL models, achieving high label accuracy-as close to 100% as possible-is paramount for reliable verification. In this article, we introduce OPAL, a human-assisted labelling method that can be configured to target a desired accuracy level while minimizing the manual effort required for labelling. The main contribution of OPAL is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that minimizes labelling effort subject to a specified accuracy target. We evaluate OPAL for two tasks in the context of testing vision systems: automatic labelling of test data and automated validation of test data. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on seven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL, relying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, just 1.2% below perfect accuracy, while cutting manual labelling by more than half. Further, OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in labelling accuracy across all seven datasets, with large effect sizes, when all methods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated test-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while achieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA validation baselines. Finally, we show that augmenting OPAL with an active learning loop leads to an additional 4.5% reduction in required manual labelling, without compromising accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[DYNAMO: Dynamic Neutral Atom Multi-programming Optimizer Towards Quantum Operating Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04874v1)** | 2025-07-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As quantum computing advances towards practical applications, quantum operating systems become inevitable, where multi-programming -- the core functionality of operating systems -- enables concurrent execution of multiple quantum programs to enhance hardware utilization. However, most quantum compilation work focuses solely on single-circuit execution, severely limiting resource efficiency and hindering quantum operating system development. We propose Dynamic Neutral Atom Multi-programming Optimizer (DYNAMO), a method that realizes multi-programming on neutral atom quantum architectures through parallel compilation and intelligent resource allocation across multiple quantum processing units (QPUs). DYNAMO addresses two critical challenges: inefficient and difficult resource partitioning, and complex scheduling conflicts from concurrent program. Our method enables efficient spatial and temporal resource sharing while maintaining circuit correctness and hardware constraints. Experimental evaluation across circuits ranging from 12 to over 1200 gates demonstrates that DYNAMO achieves up to 14.39x compilation speedup while reducing execution stages by an average of 50.47%. Furthermore, DYNAMO successfully distributes workloads across multiple QPUs with balanced resource utilization. By enabling efficient multi-programming capabilities, DYNAMO establishes a critical foundation towards realizing practical quantum operating systems.</p></details> |  |

In a differentiable programming framework, this information, such as gradients, can be automatically derived from the computational graph. We explore how nonlinear control algorithms, often employing linear and/or quadratic approximations, can be effectively cast within this framework. Our approach illuminates shared components and differences between gradient descent, Gauss-Newton, Newton, and differential dynamic programming methods in the context of discrete time nonlinear control. Furthermore, we present line-search strategies and regularized variants of these algorithms, along with a comprehensive analysis of their computational complexities. We study the performance of the aforementioned algorithms on various nonlinear control benchmarks, including autonomous car racing simulations using a simplified car model.

Direct methods for solving systems, such as Cholesky, LU, and QR factorizations, exhibit data-independent time complexity of $O(n^3)$. This raises a natural question: could there exist algorithms for solving QPs that also achieve \textit{data-independent} time complexity of $O(n^3)$? This raises a natural question: could there exist algorithms for solving QPs that also achieve data-independent time complexity of $O(n^3)$? This is critical for offering an execution time certificate for real-time optimization-based applications such as model predictive control. This article first demonstrates that solving real-time strictly convex QPs, Lasso problems, and support vector machine problems can be turned into solving box-constrained QPs (Box-QPs), which support a cost-free initialization strategy for feasible interior-point methods (IPMs). Next, focusing on solving Box-QPs, this article replaces the exact Newton step with an approximated Newton step (substituting the matrix-inversion operation with multiple rank-1 updates) within feasible IPMs. For the first time, this article proposes an implementable feasible IPM algorithm with $O(n^3)$ time complexity, by proving the number of iterations is exact $O(\sqrt{n})$ and the number of rank-1 updates is bounded by $O(n)$. Numerical validations/applications and codes are provided.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Generalizing the idea behind Pauli tableaux, we introduce a type system and lambda calculus for projective Cliffords called LambdaPC, which captures well-formed Clifford operations via a Curry-Howard correspondence with a particular encoding of the Clifford and Pauli groups. Importantly, the language captures not just qubit operations, but qudit operations for any dimension $d$. Throughout the paper we explore what it means to program with projective Cliffords through a number of examples and a case study focusing on stabilizer error correcting codes.</p></details> | 42 pages |

Similar to the relationship between first-order logic and SMT, it is based on a recent proposal of the functional stable model semantics by fixing interpretations of background theories. Analogously to a known relationship between ASP and SAT, ``tight'' ASPMT programs can be translated into SMT instances. We demonstrate the usefulness of ASPMT by enhancing action language C+ to handle continuous changes as well as discrete changes. We reformulate the semantics of C+ in terms ofASPMT, and show that SMT solvers can be used to compute the language. We also show how the language can represent cumulative effects on continuous resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 23rd International Joint Conference on Artificial Intelligence (IJCAI 2013), pages 990-996, 2013</p></details> |

However, concerns about potential biases in these instruments, even when thoroughly validated and standardised, have driven growing interest in alternatives in combining these measures with more objective methods, such as physiological measures. We aimed to (i) compare psychometric stress measures and biometric indicators and (ii) identify stress-related patterns in biometric data during software engineering tasks. We conducted an experiment where participants completed a pre-survey, then programmed two tasks wearing biometric sensors, answered brief post-surveys for each, and finally went through a short exit interview. Our results showed diverse outcomes; we found no stress in the psychometric instruments. Participants in the interviews reported a mix of feeling no stress and experiencing time pressure. Finally, the biometrics showed a significant difference only in EDA phasic peaks. We conclude that our chosen way of inducing stress by imposing a stricter time limit was insufficient. We offer methodological insights for future studies working with stress, biometrics, and psychometric instruments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating the Effectiveness of Large Language Models in Solving Simple Programming Tasks: A User-Centered Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04043v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become more common in educational tools and programming environments, questions arise about how these systems should interact with users. This study investigates how different interaction styles with ChatGPT-4o (passive, proactive, and collaborative) affect user performance on simple programming tasks. I conducted a within-subjects experiment where fifteen high school students participated, completing three problems under three distinct versions of the model. Each version was designed to represent a specific style of AI support: responding only when asked, offering suggestions automatically, or engaging the user in back-and-forth dialogue.Quantitative analysis revealed that the collaborative interaction style significantly improved task completion time compared to the passive and proactive conditions. Participants also reported higher satisfaction and perceived helpfulness when working with the collaborative version. These findings suggest that the way an LLM communicates, how it guides, prompts, and responds, can meaningfully impact learning and performance. This research highlights the importance of designing LLMs that go beyond functional correctness to support more interactive, adaptive, and user-centered experiences, especially for novice programmers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining Graph Neural Networks and Mixed Integer Linear Programming for Molecular Inference under the Two-Layered Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03920v1)** | 2025-07-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, a novel two-phase framework named mol-infer for inference of chemical compounds with prescribed abstract structures and desired property values has been proposed. The framework mol-infer is primarily based on using mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to simulate the computational process of machine learning methods and describe the necessary and sufficient conditions to ensure such a chemical graph exists. The existing approaches usually first convert the chemical compounds into handcrafted feature vectors to construct prediction functions, but because of the limit on the kinds of descriptors originated from the need for tractability in the MILP formulation, the learning performances on datasets of some properties are not good enough. A lack of good learning performance can greatly lower the quality of the inferred chemical graphs, and thus improving learning performance is of great importance. On the other hand, graph neural networks (GNN) offer a promising machine learning method to directly utilize the chemical graphs as the input, and many existing GNN-based approaches to the molecular property prediction problem have shown that they can enjoy better learning performances compared to the traditional approaches that are based on feature vectors. In this study, we develop a molecular inference framework based on mol-infer, namely mol-infer-GNN, that utilizes GNN as the learning method while keeping the great flexibility originated from the two-layered model on the abstract structure of the chemical graph to be inferred. We conducted computational experiments on the QM9 dataset to show that our proposed GNN model can obtain satisfying learning performances for some properties despite its simple structure, and can infer small chemical graphs comprising up to 20 non-hydrogen atoms within reasonable computational time.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2107.02381, arXiv:2109.02628</p></details> |

We will be showing a vivid and comprehensive application of the classical mathematical multi-criteria decision model: Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP), using the eigenvector method. We will also seek the key criteria for the sustainability development of human society, by assessing the important elements of waste recycling.First, we considered the evaluation for a quantified score of the benefits and costs of recycling household glass wastes in Shanghai, respectively. In the evaluation of each score, we both adopted the AHP method to build a hierarchical structure of the problem we are facing. We first identified the key assessment criteria of the evaluation, on various perspectives including direct money costs and benefits, and further environmental and indirect considerations. Then, we distributed questionnaires to our school science teachers, taking the geometric mean, to build the pairwise comparison matrix of the criterion. After the theoretical modeling works are done, we began collecting the essential datasets for the evaluation of each score, by doing research on the official statistics, Internet information, market information and news reports. Sometimes, we proceed a logical pre-procession of the data from other data, if the data wanted isn't directly accessible. Then, we crucially considered the generalization of our mathematical model. We considered from several perspectives, including the extension of assessment criteria, and the consideration of the dynamic interdependency between the wastes, inside a limited transportation container.</p></details> | 31 pages, 6 figures |

Differentiable forward reasoning has been developed to integrate reasoning with gradient-based machine learning paradigms. However, due to the memory intensity, most existing approaches do not bring the best of the expressivity of first-order logic, excluding a crucial ability to solve abstract visual reasoning, where agents need to perform reasoning by using analogies on abstract concepts in different scenarios. To overcome this problem, we propose NEUro-symbolic Message-pAssiNg reasoNer (NEUMANN), which is a graph-based differentiable forward reasoner, passing messages in a memory-efficient manner and handling structured programs with functors. Moreover, we propose a computationally-efficient structure learning algorithm to perform explanatory program induction on complex visual scenes. To evaluate, in addition to conventional visual reasoning tasks, we propose a new task, visual reasoning behind-the-scenes, where agents need to learn abstract programs and then answer queries by imagining scenes that are not observed. We empirically demonstrate that NEUMANN solves visual reasoning tasks efficiently, outperforming neural, symbolic, and neuro-symbolic baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at Machine Learning</p></details> |

However, debugging and repairing the underlying faults can be complex and time-consuming when verification fails. Automated Program Repair (APR) aims to ease this by automatically identifying and fixing faults. Traditional APR techniques often depend on test suites for validation, but these may fail to capture all scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide stronger correctness criteria for effective repairs. We present an innovative APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare Logic to determine the state of each statement within the program and state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The chosen models were GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% accuracy in fault localization, with GPT-4o mini yielding the highest repair success rate (74.18%). These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-driven program synthesis for automated program repair.</p></details> |  |

Both tasks are solved by a two-step hierarchical algorithm. The first step differs for the two tasks generating either a piecewise-affine or a Dubins reference path. The second step leverages a transformation of vehicle dynamics from the time domain into the spatial domain and linear programming. Benefits, such as a hyperparameter-free objective function and spatial constraints useful for area coverage gaps avoidance and precision path planning, are discussed.

We show how to transform a linear program characterizing competitive equilibrium prices into one that characterizes universal competitive equilibrium (UCE) prices, which elicit precisely the information needed to compute VCG payments. By applying a primal-dual algorithm to these transformed programs, we derive iterative Vickrey auctions that maintain a single price path, eliminating the overhead and incentive problems associated with multiple price paths used solely for payment calculations. We demonstrate the versatility of our method by developing a novel iterative Vickrey auction for the multi-unit setting and an iterative variant of the Product-Mix auction. The resulting auctions combine the transparency of iterative price discovery with the efficiency and incentive properties of the VCG mechanism.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables</p></details> |

Due to the intensive computational demands of running TGP, GPU acceleration is crucial for achieving scalable performance. However, efficient GPU-based execution of TGP still remains challenging, primarily due to three core issues: (1) the structural heterogeneity of program individuals, (2) the complexity of integrating multiple levels of parallelism, and (3) the incompatibility between high-performance CUDA execution and flexible Python-based environments. To address these issues, we propose EvoGP, a high-performance framework tailored for comprehensive GPU acceleration of TGP via population-level parallel execution. First, EvoGP introduces a tensorized representation that encodes variable-sized trees into fixed-shape, memory-aligned arrays, enabling uniform memory access and parallel computation across diverse individuals. Second, EvoGP adopts an adaptive parallelism strategy that dynamically combines intra- and inter-individual parallelism based on dataset size, ensuring high GPU utilization across a broad spectrum of tasks. Third, EvoGP embeds custom CUDA kernels into the PyTorch runtime, achieving seamless integration with Python-based environments such as Gym, MuJoCo, Brax, and Genesis. Comprehensive experiments show that EvoGP achieves up to 140x speedup over state-of-the-art GPU-based TGP implementations, while maintaining competitive accuracy and significantly improving scalability under large population sizes.

Communication between nodes can be observed by network level attackers as it inherently takes place in the open. Despite online services increasingly using encrypted traffic, the shape of the traffic is not hidden. To prevent traffic analysis, the shape of a system's traffic must be independent of secrets. We investigate adapting the data-oblivious approach the reactive setting and present OblivIO, a secure language for writing reactive programs driven by network events. Our approach pads with dummy messages to hide which program sends are genuinely executed. We use an information-flow type system to provably enforce timing-sensitive noninterference. The type system is extended with potentials to bound the overhead in traffic introduced by our approach. We address challenges that arise from joining data-oblivious and reactive programming and demonstrate the feasibility of our resulting language by developing an interpreter that implements security critical operations as constant-time algorithms.</p></details> | <details><summary>40 pa...</summary><p>40 pages, 16 figures, Technical report for paper submitted to CSF 2023</p></details> |
| **[A computationally frugal open-source foundation model for thoracic disease detection in lung cancer screening programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01881v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-dose computed tomography (LDCT) imaging employed in lung cancer screening (LCS) programs is increasing in uptake worldwide. LCS programs herald a generational opportunity to simultaneously detect cancer and non-cancer-related early-stage lung disease. Yet these efforts are hampered by a shortage of radiologists to interpret scans at scale. Here, we present TANGERINE, a computationally frugal, open-source vision foundation model for volumetric LDCT analysis. Designed for broad accessibility and rapid adaptation, TANGERINE can be fine-tuned off the shelf for a wide range of disease-specific tasks with limited computational resources and training data. Relative to models trained from scratch, TANGERINE demonstrates fast convergence during fine-tuning, thereby requiring significantly fewer GPU hours, and displays strong label efficiency, achieving comparable or superior performance with a fraction of fine-tuning data. Pretrained using self-supervised learning on over 98,000 thoracic LDCTs, including the UK's largest LCS initiative to date and 27 public datasets, TANGERINE achieves state-of-the-art performance across 14 disease classification tasks, including lung cancer and multiple respiratory diseases, while generalising robustly across diverse clinical centres. By extending a masked autoencoder framework to 3D imaging, TANGERINE offers a scalable solution for LDCT analysis, departing from recent closed, resource-intensive models by combining architectural simplicity, public availability, and modest computational requirements. Its accessible, open-source lightweight design lays the foundation for rapid integration into next-generation medical imaging tools that could transform LCS initiatives, allowing them to pivot from a singular focus on lung cancer detection to comprehensive respiratory disease management in high-risk populations.</p></details> |  |
| **[APRMCTS: Improving LLM-based Automated Program Repair with Iterative Tree Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01827v1)** | 2025-07-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) attempts to fix software bugs without human intervention, which plays a crucial role in software development and maintenance. Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a rapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt trial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1) inherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low search efficiency due to redundant exploration. In this paper, we propose APRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. APRMCTS incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing a global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising one for subsequent refinement and generation. APRMCTS effectively resolves the problems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of patch searching. Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that, when integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs, respectively. More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance advantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the 500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies. In terms of cost, compared to existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and monetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively. Our extensive study demonstrates that APRMCTS exhibits good effectiveness and efficiency, with particular advantages in addressing complex bugs.</p></details> |  |

Particularly, its RISC-V Vector Extension (RVV) becomes of interest for the acceleration of AI workloads. But writing software that efficiently utilizes the vector units of RISC-V CPUs without expert knowledge requires the programmer to rely on the autovectorization features of compilers or hand-crafted libraries like muRISCV-NN. Smarter approaches, like autotuning frameworks, have been missing the integration with the RISC-V RVV extension, thus heavily limiting the efficient deployment of complex AI workloads. In this paper, we present a workflow based on the TVM compiler to efficiently map AI workloads onto RISC-V vector units. Instead of relying on hand-crafted libraries, we integrated the RVV extension into TVM's MetaSchedule framework, a probabilistic program framework for tensor operation tuning. We implemented different RISC-V SoCs on an FPGA and tuned a wide range of AI workloads on them. We found that our proposal shows a mean improvement of 46% in execution latency when compared against the autovectorization feature of GCC, and 29% against muRISCV-NN. Moreover, the binary resulting from our proposal has a smaller code memory footprint, making it more suitable for embedded devices. Finally, we also evaluated our solution on a commercially available RISC-V SoC implementing the RVV 1.0 Vector Extension and found our solution is able to find mappings that are 35% faster on average than the ones proposed by LLVM. We open-sourced our proposal for the community to expand it to target other RISC-V extensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 10 figures, 2 algorithms</p></details> |

It defines an aggregate problem whose optimal cost function can be obtained off-line by exact DP and then used as a terminal cost approximation for an on-line reinforcement learning (RL) scheme. We derive a bound on the error between the optimal cost functions of the aggregate problem and the original problem. This bound was first derived by Tsitsiklis and van Roy [TvR96] for the special case of hard aggregation. Our bound is similar but applies far more broadly, including to soft aggregation and feature-based aggregation schemes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Speedups for Polynomial-Time Dynamic Programming Algorithms](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00823v1)** | 2025-07-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a quantum dynamic programming framework that allows us to directly extend to the quantum realm a large body of classical dynamic programming algorithms. The corresponding quantum dynamic programming algorithms retain the same space complexity as their classical counterpart, while achieving a computational speedup. For a combinatorial (search or optimization) problem $\mathcal P$ and an instance $I$ of $\mathcal P$, such a speedup can be expressed in terms of the average degree $\delta$ of the dependency digraph $G_{\mathcal{P}}(I)$ of $I$, determined by a recursive formulation of $\mathcal P$. The nodes of this graph are the subproblems of $\mathcal P$ induced by $I$ and its arcs are directed from each subproblem to those on whose solution it relies. In particular, our framework allows us to solve the considered problems in $\tilde{O}(|V(G_{\mathcal{P}}(I))| \sqrt{\delta})$ time. As an example, we obtain a quantum version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm for computing shortest paths from a single source vertex to all the other vertices in a weighted $n$-vertex digraph with $m$ edges that runs in $\tilde{O}(n\sqrt{nm})$ time, which improves the best known classical upper bound when $m \in \Omega(n^{1.4})$.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the extended version of a paper to appear at the 19th Algorithms and Data Structures Symposium (WADS 2025)</p></details> |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful mathematical capabilities, and the Chain-of-Thought technique, which guides LLMs through step-by-step reasoning, has yielded impressive results. However, this reasoning ability is limited by the computational weaknesses of LLMs themselves, where calculation errors can accumulate, leading to incorrect final answers. To address this, we propose Program of Equations Thoughts (POET), which transforms the task of generating step-by-step reasoning answers into a two-stage task of predicting equations and generating code, offloading complex computations to a Python interpreter to avoid calculation errors in LLMs. Furthermore, we propose Zero-shot POET, which utilizes a manually designed template to enable LLMs to directly generate Python code for one-step solving. Our method achieves accuracies of 95.3% and 98.0% on the PEN and ALG514 datasets, respectively, setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Zero-shot POET also achieves the SOTA result of 95.5% on the DRAW-1K dataset.</p></details> | <details><summary>Withd...</summary><p>Withdrawn pending institutional authorization and core revisions to address methodological inconsistencies in Sections 3-4</p></details> |

Our approach first regularizes the primal problem with the von Neumann entropy, then solve the regularized problem using dual gradient ascent with respect to a problem-adapted norm. In particular, we show that the dual gradient norm converges to zero at a rate independent of the ambient dimension and, via rounding arguments, construct primal-feasible solutions in certain special cases. We also derive explicit convergence rates for the objective. In order to achieve optimal computational scaling, we must accommodate the use of stochastic gradients constructed via randomized trace estimators. Throughout we illustrate the generality of our framework via three important special cases -- the Goemans-Williamson SDP relaxation of the Max-Cut problem, the optimal transport linear program, and several SDP relaxations of the permutation synchronization problem. Numerical experiments confirm that our methods achieve dimension-independent convergence in practice.</p></details> |  |

With the rise of large language models (LLMs) in recent years, research in programming education has increasingly focused on automated feedback generation to help teachers provide timely support to every student. However, prior studies often overlook key pedagogical principles, such as mastery and progress adaptation, that shape effective feedback strategies. This paper introduces a novel pedagogical framework for LLM-driven feedback generation derived from established feedback models and local insights from secondary school teachers. To evaluate this framework, we implemented a web-based application for Python programming with LLM-based feedback that follows the framework and conducted a mixed-method evaluation with eight secondary-school computer science teachers. Our findings suggest that teachers consider that, when aligned with the framework, LLMs can effectively support students and even outperform human teachers in certain scenarios through instant and precise feedback. However, we also found several limitations, such as its inability to adapt feedback to dynamic classroom contexts. Such a limitation highlights the need to complement LLM-generated feedback with human expertise to ensure effective student learning. This work demonstrates an effective way to use LLMs for feedback while adhering to pedagogical standards and highlights important considerations for future systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version of a poster paper accepted and published at ECTEL-2025</p></details> |

This transformation is also manifesting in introductory programming courses at universities around the world, generating an in-depth debate about how programming content should be taught, learned, and assessed in the context of generative artificial intelligence. This article aims, on the one hand, to review the most relevant studies on this issue, highlighting the advantages and disadvantages identified in the specialized literature. On the other hand, it proposes enriching teaching and learning methodologies by focusing on code comprehension and execution rather than on mere coding or program functionality. In particular, it advocates for the use of visual representations of code and visual simulations of its execution as effective tools for teaching, learning, and assessing programming, thus fostering a deeper understanding among students. Finally, the opinions of students who took the object-oriented programming course are presented to provide preliminary context supporting the incorporation of visual simulations in Java (or other languages) as part of the training process.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bug Fixing with Broader Context: Enhancing LLM-Based Program Repair via Layered Knowledge Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24015v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting LLMs with bug-related context (e.g., error messages, stack traces) improves automated program repair, but many bugs still remain unresolved. In real-world projects, developers often rely on broader repository and project-level context beyond the local code to resolve such bugs. In this paper, we investigate how automatically extracting and providing such knowledge can improve LLM-based program repair. We propose a layered knowledge injection framework that incrementally augments LLMs with structured context. It starts with the Bug Knowledge Layer, which includes information such as the buggy function and failing tests; expands to the Repository Knowledge Layer, which adds structural dependencies, related files, and commit history; and finally injects the Project Knowledge Layer, which incorporates relevant details from documentation and previously fixed bugs. We evaluate this framework on a dataset of 314 bugs from BugsInPy using two LLMs (Llama 3.3 and GPT-4o-mini), and analyze fix rates across six bug types. By progressively injecting knowledge across layers, our approach achieves a fix rate of 79% (250/314) using Llama 3.3, a significant improvement of 23% over previous work. All bug types show improvement with the addition of repository-level context, while only a subset benefit further from project-level knowledge, highlighting that different bug types require different levels of contextual information for effective repair. We also analyze the remaining unresolved bugs and find that more complex and structurally isolated bugs, such as Program Anomaly and GUI bugs, remain difficult even after injecting all available information. Our results show that layered context injection improves program repair and suggest the need for interactive and adaptive APR systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Using Read Promotion and Mixed Isolation Levels for Performant Yet Serializable Execution of Transaction Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.18377v3)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a theory that can determine the lowest isolation level that can be allocated to each transaction program in an application in a mixed-isolation-level setting, to guarantee that all executions will be serializable and thus preserve all integrity constraints, even those that are not explicitly declared. This extends prior work applied to completely known transactions, to deal with the realistic situation where transactions are generated by running programs with parameters that are not known in advance. Using our theory, we propose an optimization method that allows for high throughput while ensuring that all executions are serializable. Our method is based on searching for application code modifications that are semantics-preserving while improving the isolation level allocation. We illustrate our approach to the SmallBank benchmark.</p></details> |  |

We categorize the recent 63 LLM-based APR systems published from January 2022 to June 2025 into four paradigms, and show how retrieval- or analysis-augmented contexts strengthen any of them. This taxonomy clarifies key trade-offs: fine-tuning delivers strong task alignment at high training cost; prompting enables rapid deployment but is limited by prompt design and context windows; procedural pipelines offer reproducible control with moderate overhead; agentic frameworks tackle multi-hunk or cross-file bugs at the price of increased latency and complexity. Persistent challenges include verifying semantic correctness beyond test suites, repairing repository-scale defects, and lowering the costs of LLMs. We outline research directions that combine lightweight human feedback, repository-aware retrieval, code analysis, and cost-aware planning to advance reliable and efficient LLM-based APR.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Challenges Do Developers Face When Using Verification-Aware Programming Languages?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23696v1)** | 2025-06-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software reliability is critical in ensuring that the digital systems we depend on function correctly. In software development, increasing software reliability often involves testing. However, for complex and critical systems, developers can use Design by Contract (DbC) methods to define precise specifications that software components must satisfy. Verification-Aware (VA) programming languages support DbC and formal verification at compile-time or run-time, offering stronger correctness guarantees than traditional testing. However, despite the strong guarantees provided by VA languages, their adoption remains limited. In this study, we investigate the barriers to adopting VA languages by analyzing developer discussions on public forums using topic modeling techniques. We complement this analysis with a developer survey to better understand the practical challenges associated with VA languages. Our findings reveal key obstacles to adoption, including steep learning curves and usability issues. Based on these insights, we identify actionable recommendations to improve the usability and accessibility of VA languages. Our findings suggest that simplifying tool interfaces, providing better educational materials, and improving integration with everyday development environments could improve the usability and adoption of these languages. Our work provides actionable insights for improving the usability of VA languages and making verification tools more accessible.</p></details> |  |

We analysed a curated set of videos depicting extended vibe coding sessions with rich think-aloud reflections. Using framework analysis, we investigated programmers' goals, workflows, prompting techniques, debugging approaches, and challenges encountered. We find that vibe coding follows iterative goal satisfaction cycles where developers alternate between prompting AI, evaluating generated code through rapid scanning and application testing, and manual editing. Prompting strategies blend vague, high-level directives with detailed technical specifications. Debugging remains a hybrid process combining AI assistance with manual practices. Critically, vibe coding does not eliminate the need for programming expertise but rather redistributes it toward context management, rapid code evaluation, and decisions about when to transition between AI-driven and manual manipulation of code. Trust in AI tools during vibe coding is dynamic and contextual, developed through iterative verification rather than blanket acceptance. Vibe coding is an evolution of AI-assisted programming that represents an early manifestation of "material disengagement", where practitioners orchestrate code production and manipulation, mediated through AI, while maintaining selective and strategic oversight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Repair Ingredients Are All You Need: Improving Large Language Model-Based Program Repair via Repair Ingredients Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23100v1)** | 2025-06-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) techniques aim to automatically fix buggy programs. Among these, Large Language Model-based (LLM-based) approaches have shown great promise. Recent advances demonstrate that directly leveraging LLMs can achieve leading results. However, these techniques remain suboptimal in generating contextually relevant and accurate patches, as they often overlook repair ingredients crucial for practical program repair. In this paper, we propose ReinFix, a novel framework that enables LLMs to autonomously search for repair ingredients throughout both the reasoning and solution phases of bug fixing. In the reasoning phase, ReinFix integrates static analysis tools to retrieve internal ingredients, such as variable definitions, to assist the LLM in root cause analysis when it encounters difficulty understanding the context. During the solution phase, when the LLM lacks experience in fixing specific bugs, ReinFix searches for external ingredients from historical bug fixes with similar bug patterns, leveraging both the buggy code and its root cause to guide the LLM in identifying appropriate repair actions, thereby increasing the likelihood of generating correct patches. Evaluations on two popular benchmarks (Defects4J V1.2 and V2.0) demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach over SOTA baselines. Notably, ReinFix fixes 146 bugs, which is 32 more than the baselines on Defects4J V1.2. On Defects4J V2.0, ReinFix fixes 38 more bugs than the SOTA. Importantly, when evaluating on the recent benchmarks that are free of data leakage risk, ReinFix also maintains the best performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2026.

| **[Evaluating and Improving Large Language Models for Competitive Program Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.22954v1)** | 2025-06-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Due to the demand for strong algorithmic reasoning, complex logic implementation, and strict adherence to input/output formats and resource constraints, competitive programming generation by large language models (LLMs) is considered the most challenging problem in current LLM-based code generation. However, previous studies often evaluate LLMs using simple prompts and benchmark datasets prone to data leakage. Moreover, prior work has limited consideration of the diversity in algorithm types and difficulty levels. Objective: In this study, we aim to evaluate and improve LLMs in solving real-world competitive programming problems. Methods: We initially collect 117 problems from nine regional ICPC/CCPC contests held in 2024 and design four filtering criteria to construct a curated benchmark consisting of 80 problems. Leveraging DeepSeek-R1 as the LLM, we evaluate its competitive program generation capabilities through the online judge (OJ) platforms, guided by a carefully designed basic prompt. For incorrect submissions, we construct a fine-grained error taxonomy and then propose a targeted improvement framework by combining a multi-turn dialogue-based repair phase and an information-augmented regeneration phase. Results: Experimental results show that only 5 out of 80 problems are fully accepted when using basic prompts. For the unsolved problems, we construct the error taxonomy, including general errors (such as design, boundary, condition, data type, syntax, and input/output errors) and specialized errors (such as those in mathematical problems, greedy algorithms, and graph theories). After applying our proposed improvement strategies, we substantially increased the number of correct solutions, with 46 out of 80 problems successfully accepted.</p></details> |  |

Prior research indicates that LLMs pre-trained with programming language data exhibit high mathematical and reasoning abilities; however, this causal relationship has not been rigorously tested. Our research aims to verify which programming languages and features during pre-training affect logical inference performance. Specifically, we pre-trained decoder-based language models from scratch using datasets from ten programming languages (e.g., Python, C, Java) and three natural language datasets (Wikipedia, Fineweb, C4) under identical conditions. Thereafter, we evaluated the trained models in a few-shot in-context learning setting on logical reasoning tasks: FLD and bAbi, which do not require commonsense or world knowledge. The results demonstrate that nearly all models trained with programming languages consistently outperform those trained with natural languages, indicating that programming languages contain factors that elicit logic inference performance. In addition, we found that models trained with programming languages exhibit a better ability to follow instructions compared to those trained with natural languages. Further analysis reveals that the depth of Abstract Syntax Trees representing parsed results of programs also affects logical reasoning performance. These findings will offer insights into the essential elements of pre-training for acquiring the foundational abilities of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP2024</p></details> |

However, the current practice of incorporating these helpful physics-informed inductive biases inevitably runs into significant manual labor and domain expertise, making them prohibitive for general users. This work explores a symbolic approach to distill physics-informed inductive biases into RL agents, where the physics priors are expressed in a domain-specific language (DSL) that is human-readable and naturally explainable. Yet, the DSL priors do not translate directly into an implementable policy due to partial and noisy observations and additional physical constraints in navigation tasks. To address this gap, we develop a physics-informed program-guided RL (PiPRL) framework with applications to indoor navigation. PiPRL adopts a hierarchical and modularized neuro-symbolic integration, where a meta symbolic program receives semantically meaningful features from a neural perception module, which form the bases for symbolic programming that encodes physics priors and guides the RL process of a low-level neural controller. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PiPRL consistently outperforms purely symbolic or neural policies and reduces training time by over 26% with the help of the program-based inductive biases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Spotl...</summary><p>Spotlight paper at Reinforcement Learning Conference 2025, Workshop on Inductive Biases in Reinforcement Learning</p></details> |

A prominent engineering challenge revolves around programming the collective adaptive behaviour of such computational ecosystems. This requires abstractions able to capture concepts like ensembles (dynamic groups of cooperating devices) and collective tasks (joint activities carried out by ensembles). In this work, we consider collections of devices interacting with neighbours and that execute in nearly-synchronised sense-compute-interact rounds, where the computation is given by a single program mapping sensing values and incoming messages to output and outcoming messages. To support programming whole computational collectives, we propose the abstraction of a distributed collective process, which can be used to define at once the ensemble formation logic and its collective task. We formalise the abstraction in the eXchange Calculus (XC), a core functional language based on neighbouring values (maps from neighbours to values) where state and interaction is handled through a single primitive, exchange, and provide a corresponding implementation in the FCPP language. Then, we exercise distributed collective processes using two case studies: multi-hop message propagation and distributed monitoring of spatial properties. Finally, we discuss the features of the abstraction and its suitability for different kinds of distributed computing applications.</p></details> | 41 pages, 17 figures |

This study seeks to establish the groundwork for Integer Evolution Strategies (IESs), a class of randomized search heuristics inherently designed for continuous spaces. IESs already excel in treating IP in practice, but accomplish it via discretization and by applying sophisticated patches to their continuous operators, while persistently using the $\ell_2$-norm as their operation pillar. We lay foundations for discrete search, by adopting the $\ell_1$-norm, accounting for the suitable step-size, and questioning alternative measures to quantify correlations over the integer lattice. We focus on mutation distributions for unbounded integer decision variables. We briefly discuss a couple of candidate discrete probabilities induced by the uniform and binomial distributions, which we show to possess less appealing theoretical properties, and then narrow down to the Truncated Normal (TN) and Double Geometric (DG) distributions. We explore their theoretical properties, including entropy functions, and propose a procedure to generate scalable correlated mutation distributions. Our investigations are accompanied by extensive numerical simulations, which consistently support the claim that the DG distribution is better suited for unbounded integer search. We link our theoretical perspective to empirical evidence indicating that an IES with correlated DG mutations outperformed other strategies over non-separable quadratic IP. We conclude that while the replacement of the default TN distribution by the DG is theoretically justified and practically beneficial, the truly crucial change lies in adopting the $\ell_1$-norm over the $\ell_2$-norm.</p></details> |  |

However, integrating deep learning on UAVs remains challenging due to platform heterogeneity, real-time constraints, and the need for seamless cloud-edge coordination. To address these challenges, we introduce AeroDaaS, a service-oriented framework that abstracts UAV-based sensing complexities and provides a Drone-as-a-Service (DaaS) model for intelligent decision-making. AeroDaaS offers modular service primitives for on-demand UAV sensing, navigation, and analytics as composable microservices, ensuring cross-platform compatibility and scalability across heterogeneous UAV and edge-cloud infrastructures. We implement and evaluate a preliminary version of AeroDaaS for two real-world DaaS applications. We require <=40 lines of code for the applications and see minimal platform overhead of <=20 ms per frame and <=0.5 GB memory usage on Orin Nano. These early results are promising for AeroDaaS as an efficient, flexible and scalable UAV programming framework for autonomous aerial analytics.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, To Appear as a Short Paper at the 2025 IEEE International Conference on Web Services (ICWS)</p></details> |

It allows verifying that the students correctly apply the features and concepts they are taught, or finding students' misconceptions. However, existing data collection tools have limitations, e.g., no control over the granularity of the collected code, not collecting the specific events of the programming environment used, and overall being hard to configure. To overcome these limitations, we propose KOALA, a convenient and highly configurable tool for collecting code snapshots and feature usage from students solving programming tasks in JetBrains IDEs. The plugin can be installed in IDEs and configured to provide the students with the necessary tasks, enable or disable certain IDE features like code completion, and run surveys. During problem solving, the plugin collects code snapshots at the configured granularity, all IDE actions like running and debugging, as well as some data not collected in prior works, like employed hotkeys and switching focus between files. The collected data is sent to the server that comes with the tool, where it is stored and can be converted to the standardized ProgSnap2 format. To showcase the tool, we collected data from 28 students solving tasks in two courses within the IDE, highlighting some insights from this data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CompEd'25, 7 pages, 4 figures</p></details> |

In recent years, the substantial advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) and the Chain-of-Thought (CoT) techniques have significantly enhanced the reasoning capabilities of these models. However, due to the complex logic and multi-step reasoning ability needed, the application of CoT techniques in the APR domain remains insufficient. This study systematically evaluates the performance of several common CoT techniques in APR tasks and proposes an innovative framework $T^3$, which integrates the powerful reasoning capabilities of LLMs with tree search, effectively improving the precision of generating candidate repair solutions. Furthermore, $T^3$ provides valuable guidance for optimizing sample selection and repair strategies in APR tasks, establishing a robust framework for achieving efficient automated debugging.</p></details> |  |

This is particularly so with younger children, who are known to have difficulties with pervasive screen time. Working with a tangible programming robot called Cubetto, we propose an approach to benefit from the capabilities of LLMs by employing such models in the preparation of personalised storytelling, necessary for preschool children to get accustomed to the practice of commanding the robot. We engage in action research to develop an early version of a formalised process to rapidly prototype game stories for Cubetto. Our approach has both reproducible results, because it employs open weight models, and is model-agnostic, because we test it with 5 different LLMs. We document on one hand the process, the used materials and prompts, and on the other the learning experience and outcomes. We deem the generation successful for the intended purposes of using the results as a teacher aid. Testing the models on 4 different task scenarios, we encounter issues of consistency and hallucinations and document the corresponding evaluation process and attempts (some successful and some not) to overcome these issues. Importantly, the process does not expose children to LLMs directly. Rather, the technology is used to help teachers easily develop personalised narratives on children's preferred topics. We believe our method is adequate for preschool classes and we are planning to further experiment in real-world educational settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at D-SAIL Workshop - Transformative Curriculum Design: Digitalization, Sustainability, and AI Literacy for 21st Century Learning</p></details> |

| **[Integrating Various Software Artifacts for Better LLM-based Bug Localization and Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03905v3)** | 2025-06-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa.

We introduce COBRA-PPM, a novel causal Bayesian reasoning architecture that combines causal Bayesian networks and probabilistic programming to perform interventional inference for robot manipulation under uncertainty. We demonstrate its capabilities through high-fidelity Gazebo-based experiments on an exemplar block stacking task, where it predicts manipulation outcomes with high accuracy (Pred Acc: 88.6%) and performs greedy next-best action selection with a 94.2% task success rate. We further demonstrate sim2real transfer on a domestic robot, showing effectiveness in handling real-world uncertainty from sensor noise and stochastic actions. Our generalised and extensible framework supports a wide range of manipulation scenarios and lays a foundation for future work at the intersection of robotics and causality.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 7 figures, accepted to the 2025 IEEE European Conference on Mobile Robots (ECMR 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Interpretable Hybrid Machine Learning Models Using FOLD-R++ and Answer Set Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19573v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) techniques play a pivotal role in high-stakes domains such as healthcare, where accurate predictions can greatly enhance decision-making. However, most high-performing methods such as neural networks and ensemble methods are often opaque, limiting trust and broader adoption. In parallel, symbolic methods like Answer Set Programming (ASP) offer the possibility of interpretable logical rules but do not always match the predictive power of ML models. This paper proposes a hybrid approach that integrates ASP-derived rules from the FOLD-R++ algorithm with black-box ML classifiers to selectively correct uncertain predictions and provide human-readable explanations. Experiments on five medical datasets reveal statistically significant performance gains in accuracy and F1 score. This study underscores the potential of combining symbolic reasoning with conventional ML to achieve high interpretability without sacrificing accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication as a Technical Communication at ICLP 2025</p></details> |
| **[Programming Geotechnical Reliability Algorithms using Generative AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19536v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Programming reliability algorithms is crucial for risk assessment in geotechnical engineering. This study explores the possibility of automating and accelerating this task using Generative AI based on Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, the most popular LLM, i.e., ChatGPT, is used to test the ability to generate MATLAB codes for four classical reliability algorithms. The four specific examples considered in this study are: (1) First Order Reliability Method (FORM); (2) Subset simulation; (3) Random field simulation; and (4) Bayesian update using Gibbs sampling. The results obtained using the generated codes are compared with benchmark methods. It is found that the use of LLMs can be promising for generating reliability codes. Failure, limitations, and challenges of adopting LLMs are also discussed. Overall, this study demonstrates that existing LLMs can be leveraged powerfully and can contribute toward accelerating the adoption of reliability techniques in routine geotechnical engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Pair Programming as a Work Practice](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19511v1)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Pair programming (PP) is more relevant than ever. As modern systems grow in complexity, knowledge sharing and collaboration across teams have become essential. However, despite well-documented benefits of PP, its adoption remains inconsistent across software teams. Objective: This study aims to understand the factors that facilitate or hinder team members' adoption as well as lasting engagement in PP. Method: We have conducted an exploratory single-case study in a mature agile company in Norway. We collected data through two rounds of interviews with team members in different roles and performed a thematic analysis of the interviews. Results: Our key finding is that multiple factors, related to the perceptions of how PP contributes to daily work, efforts associated with engaging in PP sessions, company and team attitudes, resources, infrastructure, and task characteristics, affect PP engagement. Conclusion: Long-term engagement in PP requires expected benefits with the practice being confirmed in firsthand experiences. Adapting the practice to each unique team, with insights drawn from collective learning, is also beneficial. Our findings will be beneficial for software practitioners seeking to make PP an integrated part of their team's workflow.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The pre-print is submitted to the Journal of Systems and Software</p></details> |
| **[The Elements of Differentiable Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.14606v3)** | 2025-06-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Artificial intelligence has recently experienced remarkable advances, fueled by large models, vast datasets, accelerated hardware, and, last but not least, the transformative power of differentiable programming. This new programming paradigm enables end-to-end differentiation of complex computer programs (including those with control flows and data structures), making gradient-based optimization of program parameters possible. As an emerging paradigm, differentiable programming builds upon several areas of computer science and applied mathematics, including automatic differentiation, graphical models, optimization and statistics. This book presents a comprehensive review of the fundamental concepts useful for differentiable programming. We adopt two main perspectives, that of optimization and that of probability, with clear analogies between the two. Differentiable programming is not merely the differentiation of programs, but also the thoughtful design of programs intended for differentiation. By making programs differentiable, we inherently introduce probability distributions over their execution, providing a means to quantify the uncertainty associated with program outputs.</p></details> | Draft version 3 |
| **[Total Outcome Logic: Unified Reasoning for a Taxonomy of Program Logics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.00197v2)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While there is a long tradition of reasoning about (non)termination in program analysis, specialized logics are typically needed to give different termination criteria. This includes partial correctness, where termination is not guaranteed, and total correctness, where it is guaranteed. We present Total Outcome Logic (TOL), a single logic which can express the full spectrum of termination conditions and program properties offered by the aforementioned logics. TOL extends (non)termination and (in)correctness reasoning across different kinds of branching effects, so that a single metatheory powers this reasoning in different kinds of programs, including nondeterministic and probabilistic. We also show that TOL subsumes several recently created taxonomies of (in)correctness logics, so that many different kinds of properties can be proven with a single unified theory.</p></details> |  |
| **[Programming by Backprop: LLMs Acquire Reusable Algorithmic Abstractions During Code Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18777v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models (LLMs) on source code significantly enhances their general-purpose reasoning abilities, but the mechanisms underlying this generalisation are poorly understood. In this paper, we propose Programming by Backprop (PBB) as a potential driver of this effect - teaching a model to evaluate a program for inputs by training on its source code alone, without ever seeing I/O examples. To explore this idea, we finetune LLMs on two sets of programs representing simple maths problems and algorithms: one with source code and I/O examples (w/ IO), the other with source code only (w/o IO). We find evidence that LLMs have some ability to evaluate w/o IO programs for inputs in a range of experimental settings, and make several observations. Firstly, PBB works significantly better when programs are provided as code rather than semantically equivalent language descriptions. Secondly, LLMs can produce outputs for w/o IO programs directly, by implicitly evaluating the program within the forward pass, and more reliably when stepping through the program in-context via chain-of-thought. We further show that PBB leads to more robust evaluation of programs across inputs than training on I/O pairs drawn from a distribution that mirrors naturally occurring data. Our findings suggest a mechanism for enhanced reasoning through code training: it allows LLMs to internalise reusable algorithmic abstractions. Significant scope remains for future work to enable LLMs to more effectively learn from symbolic procedures, and progress in this direction opens other avenues like model alignment by training on formal constitutional principles.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semidefinite Programming for the Asymmetric Stochastic Block Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18754v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider semidefinite programming (SDP) for the binary stochastic block model with equal-sized communities. Prior work of Hajek, Wu, and Xu proposed an SDP (sym-SDP) for the symmetric case where the intra-community edge probabilities are equal, and showed that the SDP achieves the information-theoretic threshold for exact recovery under the symmetry assumption. A key open question is whether SDPs can be used to achieve exact recovery for non-symmetric block models. In order to inform the design of a new SDP for the non-symmetric setting, we investigate the failure of sym-SDP when it is applied to non-symmetric settings. We formally show that sym-SDP fails to return the correct labeling of the vertices in some information-theoretically feasible, asymmetric cases. In addition, we give an intuitive geometric interpretation of the failure of sym-SDP in asymmetric settings, which in turn suggests an SDP formulation to handle the asymmetric setting. Still, this new SDP cannot be readily analyzed by existing techniques, suggesting a fundamental limitation in the design of SDPs for community detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bloch Vector Assertions for Debugging Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.18458v1)** | 2025-06-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum programs must be reliable to ensure trustworthy results, yet debugging them is notoriously challenging due to quantum-specific faults like gate misimplementations and hardware noise, as well as their inherently probabilistic nature. Assertion-based debugging provides a promising solution by enabling localized correctness checks during execution. However, current approaches face challenges including manual assertion generation, reliance on mid-circuit-measurements, and poor scalability. In this paper, we present Bloq, a scalable, automated fault localization approach introducing Bloch-vector-based assertions utilizing expectation value measurements of Pauli operators, enabling low-overhead fault localization without mid-circuit measurements. In addition, we introduce AutoBloq, a component of Bloq for automatically generating assertion schemes from quantum algorithms. An experimental evaluation over 684432 programs using two algorithms (Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) and Grover) shows that Bloq consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art approach Proq, notably as circuit depth and noise increase. For Grover, Bloq achieves a mean F1 score across all experimental instances of 0.74 versus 0.38 for Proq under ideal conditions, and maintains performance under noise (0.43 versus 0.06). Bloq also reduces Proq's runtime by a factor of 5 and circuit depth overhead by a factor of 23. These results underline Bloq's potential to make assertion-based debugging scalable and effective for near-term quantum devices.</p></details> | <details><summary>Journ...</summary><p>Journal Submission, 40 pages</p></details> |
| **[HPVM-HDC: A Heterogeneous Programming System for Accelerating Hyperdimensional Computing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15179v3)** | 2025-06-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperdimensional Computing (HDC), a technique inspired by cognitive models of computation, has been proposed as an efficient and robust alternative basis for machine learning. HDC programs are often manually written in low-level and target specific languages targeting CPUs, GPUs, and FPGAs -- these codes cannot be easily retargeted onto HDC-specific accelerators. No previous programming system enables productive development of HDC programs and generates efficient code for several hardware targets. We propose a heterogeneous programming system for HDC: a novel programming language, HDC++, for writing applications using a unified programming model, including HDC-specific primitives to improve programmability, and a heterogeneous compiler, HPVM-HDC, that provides an intermediate representation for compiling HDC programs to many hardware targets. We implement two tuning optimizations, automatic binarization and reduction perforation, that exploit the error resilient nature of HDC. Our evaluation shows that HPVM-HDC generates performance-competitive code for CPUs and GPUs, achieving a geomean speed-up of 1.17x over optimized baseline CUDA implementations with a geomean reduction in total lines of code of 1.6x across CPUs and GPUs. Additionally, HPVM-HDC targets an HDC Digital ASIC and an HDC ReRAM accelerator simulator, enabling the first execution of HDC applications on these devices.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncertainty-Aware Planning for Heterogeneous Robot Teams using Dynamic Topological Graphs and Mixed-Integer Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.08396v5)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-robot planning and coordination in uncertain environments is a fundamental computational challenge, since the belief space increases exponentially with the number of robots. In this paper, we address the problem of planning in uncertain environments with a heterogeneous robot team of fast scout vehicles for information gathering and more risk-averse carrier robots from which the scouts vehicles are deployed. To overcome the computational challenges, we represent the environment and operational scenario using a topological graph, where the parameters of the edge weight distributions vary with the state of the robot team on the graph, and we formulate a computationally efficient mixed-integer program which removes the dependence on the number of robots from its decision space. Our formulation results in the capability to generate optimal multi-robot, long-horizon plans in seconds that could otherwise be computationally intractable. Ultimately our approach enables real-time re-planning, since the computation time is significantly faster than the time to execute one step. We evaluate our algorithm in a scenario where the robot team must traverse an environment while minimizing detection by observers in positions that are uncertain to the robot team. We demonstrate that our method is computationally tractable, can improve performance in the presence of imperfect information, and can be adjusted for different risk profiles.</p></details> | <details><summary>\copy...</summary><p>\copyright 2025 IEEE.

| **[A Fully Digital Relaxation-Aware Analog Programming Technique for HfOx RRAM Arrays](http://arxiv.org/abs/2301.08516v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For neuromorphic engineering to emulate the human brain, improving memory density with low power consumption is an indispensable but challenging goal. In this regard, emerging RRAMs have attracted considerable interest for their unique qualities like low power consumption, high integration potential, durability, and CMOS compatibility. Using RRAMs to imitate the more analog storage behavior of brain synapses is also a promising strategy for further improving memory density and power efficiency. However, RRAM devices display strong stochastic behavior, together with relaxation effects, making it more challenging to precisely control their multi-level storage capability. To address this, researchers have reported different multi-level programming strategies, mostly involving the precise control of analog parameters like compliance current during write operations and/or programming voltage amplitudes. Here, we present a new fully digital relaxation-aware method for tuning the conductance of analog RRAMs. The method is based on modulating digital pulse widths during erase operations while keeping other parameters fixed, and therefore requires no precise alterations to analog parameters like compliance currents or programming voltage amplitudes. Experimental results, with and without relaxation effect awareness, on a 64 RRAM 1T1R HfOx memory array of cells, fabricated in 130nm CMOS technology, indicate that it is possible to obtain 2-bit memory per cell multi-value storage at the array level, verified 1000 seconds after programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 10 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Adversarial Reasoning for Repair Based on Inferred Program Intent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13008v2)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has shown promising results, particularly with the use of neural networks. Currently, most APR tools focus on code transformations specified by test suites, rather than reasoning about the program intent and the high-level bug specification. Without a proper understanding of program intent, these tools tend to generate patches that overfit incomplete test suites and fail to reflect the developers intentions. However, reasoning about program intent is challenging. In our work, we propose an approach called AdverIntent-Agent, based on critique and adversarial reasoning. Our approach is novel to shift the focus from generating multiple APR patches to inferring multiple potential program intents. Ideally, we aim to infer intents that are, to some extent, adversarial to each other, maximizing the probability that at least one aligns closely with the developers original intent. AdverIntent-Agent is a multi-agent approach consisting of three agents: a reasoning agent, a test agent, and a repair agent. First, the reasoning agent generates adversarial program intents along with the corresponding faulty statements. Next, the test agent produces adversarial test cases that align with each inferred intent, constructing oracles that use the same inputs but have different expected outputs. Finally, the repair agent uses dynamic and precise LLM prompts to generate patches that satisfy both the inferred program intent and the generated tests. AdverIntent-Agent was evaluated on two benchmarks: Defects4J 2.0 and HumanEval-Java. AdverIntent-Agent correctly repaired 77 and 105 bugs in both benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[PasteTrace: A Single Source Plagiarism Detection Tool For Introductory Programming Courses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.17355v1)** | 2025-06-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Introductory Computer Science classes are important for laying the foundation for advanced programming courses. However, students without prior programming experience may find these courses challenging, leading to difficulties in understanding concepts and engaging in academic dishonesty such as plagiarism. While there exists plagiarism detection techniques and tools, not all of them are suitable for academic settings, especially in introductory programming courses. This paper introduces PasteTrace, a novel open-source plagiarism detection tool designed specifically for introductory programming courses. Unlike traditional methods, PasteTrace operates within an Integrated Development Environment that tracks the student's coding activities in real-time for evidence of plagiarism. Our evaluation of PasteTrace in two introductory programming courses demonstrates the tool's ability to provide insights into student behavior and detect various forms of plagiarism, outperforming an existing well-established tool. A video demonstration of PasteTrace and its source code, and case study data are made available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.27115852</p></details> |  |
