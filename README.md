| **[A Novel Taxonomy and Classification Scheme for Code Smell Interactions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18469v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code smells are indicators of potential design flaws in source code and do not appear alone but in combination with other smells, creating complex interactions. While existing literature classifies these smell interactions into collocated, coupled, and inter-smell relations, however, to the best of our knowledge, no research has used the existing knowledge of code smells and (or) their relationships with other code smells in the detection of code smells. This gap highlights the need for deeper investigation into how code smells interact with each other and assist in their detection. This would improve the overall comprehension of code smells and how they interact more effectively. This study presents a novel taxonomy and a proposed classification scheme for the possible code smell interactions considering a specific programming language as a domain. This paper has dealt with one scenario called Inter smell detection within the domain. The experiments have been carried out using several popular machine learning (ML) models. Results primarily show the presence of code smell interactions namely Inter-smell Detection within domain. These results are compatible with the available facts in the literature suggesting a promising direction for future research in code smell detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Bias Detection in Source Code Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18449v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bias is an inherent threat to human decision-making, including in decisions made during software development. Extensive research has demonstrated the presence of biases at various stages of the software development life-cycle. Notably, code reviews are highly susceptible to prejudice-induced biases, and individuals are often unaware of these biases as they occur. Developing methods to automatically detect these biases is crucial for addressing the associated challenges. Recent advancements in visual data analytics have shown promising results in detecting potential biases by analyzing user interaction patterns. In this project, we propose a controlled experiment to extend this approach to detect potentially biased outcomes in code reviews by observing how reviewers interact with the code. We employ the "spotlight model of attention", a cognitive framework where a reviewer's gaze is tracked to determine their focus areas on the review screen. This focus, identified through gaze tracking, serves as an indicator of the reviewer's areas of interest or concern. We plan to analyze the sequence of gaze focus using advanced sequence modeling techniques, including Markov Models, Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), and Conditional Random Fields (CRF). These techniques will help us identify patterns that may suggest biased interactions. We anticipate that the ability to automatically detect potentially biased interactions in code reviews will significantly reduce unnecessary push-backs, enhance operational efficiency, and foster greater diversity and inclusion in software development. This approach not only helps in identifying biases but also in creating a more equitable development environment by mitigating these biases effectively</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatically Generating UI Code from Screenshot: A Divide-and-Conquer-Based Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.16386v3)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Websites are critical in today's digital world, with over 1.11 billion currently active and approximately 252,000 new sites launched daily. Converting website layout design into functional UI code is a time-consuming yet indispensable step of website development. Manual methods of converting visual designs into functional code present significant challenges, especially for non-experts. To explore automatic design-to-code solutions, we first conduct a motivating study on GPT-4o and identify three types of issues in generating UI code: element omission, element distortion, and element misarrangement. We further reveal that a focus on smaller visual segments can help multimodal large language models (MLLMs) mitigate these failures in the generation process. In this paper, we propose DCGen, a divide-and-conquer-based approach to automate the translation of webpage design to UI code. DCGen starts by dividing screenshots into manageable segments, generating code for each segment, and then reassembling them into complete UI code for the entire screenshot. We conduct extensive testing with a dataset comprised of real-world websites and various MLLMs and demonstrate that DCGen achieves up to a 15% improvement in visual similarity and 8% in code similarity for large input images. Human evaluations show that DCGen can help developers implement webpages significantly faster and more similar to the UI designs. To the best of our knowledge, DCGen is the first segment-aware MLLM-based approach for generating UI code directly from screenshots.</p></details> | Accepted by FSE 2025 |
| **[Are We on the Same Page? Examining Developer Perception Alignment in Open Source Code Reviews](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18407v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code reviews are a critical aspect of open-source software (OSS) development, ensuring quality and fostering collaboration. This study examines perceptions, challenges, and biases in OSS code review processes, focusing on the perspectives of Contributors and Maintainers. Through surveys (n=289), interviews (n=23), and repository analysis (n=81), we identify key areas of alignment and disparity. While both groups share common objectives, differences emerge in priorities, e.g, with Maintainers emphasizing alignment with project goals while Contributors overestimated the value of novelty. Bias, particularly familiarity bias, disproportionately affects underrepresented groups, discouraging participation and limiting community growth. Misinterpretation of approach differences as bias further complicates reviews. Our findings underscore the need for improved documentation, better tools, and automated solutions to address delays and enhance inclusivity. This work provides actionable strategies to promote fairness and sustain the long-term innovation of OSS ecosystems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Paradigm shift on Coding Productivity Using GenAI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18404v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI (GenAI) applications are transforming software engineering by enabling automated code co-creation. However, empirical evidence on GenAI's productivity effects in industrial settings remains limited. This paper investigates the adoption of GenAI coding assistants (e.g., Codeium, Amazon Q) within telecommunications and FinTech domains. Through surveys and interviews with industrial domain-experts, we identify primary productivity-influencing factors, including task complexity, coding skills, domain knowledge, and GenAI integration. Our findings indicate that GenAI tools enhance productivity in routine coding tasks (e.g., refactoring and Javadoc generation) but face challenges in complex, domain-specific activities due to limited context-awareness of codebases and insufficient support for customized design rules. We highlight new paradigms for coding transfer, emphasizing iterative prompt refinement, immersive development environment, and automated code evaluation as essential for effective GenAI usage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Partition Map-Based Fast Block Partitioning for VVC Inter Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18398v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Among the new techniques of Versatile Video Coding (VVC), the quadtree with nested multi-type tree (QT+MTT) block structure yields significant coding gains by providing more flexible block partitioning patterns. However, the recursive partition search in the VVC encoder increases the encoder complexity substantially. To address this issue, we propose a partition map-based algorithm to pursue fast block partitioning in inter coding. Based on our previous work on partition map-based methods for intra coding, we analyze the characteristics of VVC inter coding, and thus improve the partition map by incorporating an MTT mask for early termination. Next, we develop a neural network that uses both spatial and temporal features to predict the partition map. It consists of several special designs including stacked top-down and bottom-up processing, quantization parameter modulation layers, and partitioning-adaptive warping. Furthermore, we present a dual-threshold decision scheme to achieve a fine-grained trade-off between complexity reduction and rate-distortion (RD) performance loss. The experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method achieves an average 51.30% encoding time saving with a 2.12% Bjontegaard Delta Bit Rate (BDBR) under the random access configuration.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 26 figures.

| **[On the Generalization of Kitaev Codes as Generalized Bicycle Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18360v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Surface codes have historically been the dominant choice for quantum error correction due to their superior error threshold performance. However, recently, a new class of Generalized Bicycle (GB) codes, constructed from binary circulant matrices with three non-zero elements per row, achieved comparable performance with fewer physical qubits and higher encoding efficiency. In this article, we focus on a subclass of GB codes, which are constructed from pairs of binary circulant matrices with two non-zero elements per row. We introduce a family of codes that generalizes both standard and optimized Kitaev codes for which we have a lower bound on their minimum distance, ensuring performance better than standard Kitaev codes. These codes exhibit parameters of the form $ [| 2n , 2, \geq \sqrt{n} |] $ where $ n$ is a factor of $ 1 + d^2 $. For code lengths below 200, our analysis yields $21$ codes, including $7$ codes from Pryadko and Wang's database, and unveils $14$ new codes with enhanced minimum distance compared to standard Kitaev codes. Among these, $3$ surpass all previously known weight-4 GB codes for distances $4$, $8$, and $12$.</p></details> |  |
| **[NRevisit: A Cognitive Behavioral Metric for Code Understandability Assessment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18345v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Measuring code understandability is both highly relevant and exceptionally challenging. This paper proposes a dynamic code understandability assessment method, which estimates a personalized code understandability score from the perspective of the specific programmer handling the code. The method consists of dynamically dividing the code unit under development or review in code regions (invisible to the programmer) and using the number of revisits (NRevisit) to each region as the primary feature for estimating the code understandability score. This approach removes the uncertainty related to the concept of a "typical programmer" assumed by static software code complexity metrics and can be easily implemented using a simple, low-cost, and non-intrusive desktop eye tracker or even a standard computer camera. This metric was evaluated using cognitive load measured through electroencephalography (EEG) in a controlled experiment with 35 programmers. Results show a very high correlation ranging from rs = 0.9067 to rs = 0.9860 (with p nearly 0) between the scores obtained with different alternatives of NRevisit and the ground truth represented by the EEG measurements of programmers' cognitive load, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach in reflecting the cognitive effort required for code comprehension. The paper also discusses possible practical applications of NRevisit, including its use in the context of AI-generated code, which is already widely used today.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rack-Aware Minimum Storage Partially Cooperative Regenerating Codes with Small Sub-Packetization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18335v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the rack-aware model, there are $\bar{n}$ racks each of which has $u$ nodes with the same storage capacity. Assume that there are $h$ failed nodes uniformly distributed in $\bar{h}$ host racks ( defined as racks containing failed nodes), each rack containing $h/\bar{h}$ failed nodes where $h$ is divisible by $\bar{h}$. Then together with its internal helper nodes, each host rack downloads recovery data from $\bar{d}$ helper racks and repairs its failed nodes. The repair bandwidth is defined as the total inter-rack data transfer required for failures recovery, as the intra-rack communication does not contribute to this cost. The full cooperative repair model requires that each host rack must exchange the data with all the other $\bar{h}$ host racks during the cooperative repair phase. However, in the partial cooperative repair model, each host rack only needs to exchange data with $\bar{h}-\delta\ (1\leq\delta\leq\bar{h}-1)$ other host racks, during the cooperative repair phase. In this paper, we focus on the rack-aware minimum storage partially cooperative regenerating (MSPCR) codes for repairing the $h$ node failures. We first derive the lower bound on the repair bandwidth for rack-aware MSPCR codes using extremal combinatorics, and then construct two classes of optimal repair schemes for rack-aware MSPCR codes with small sub-packetization level. In particular, when $\delta=1$, our second codes reduce to rack-aware minimum-storage cooperative regenerating (MSCR) codes, while achieving an $(\bar{h}+1)$-fold reduction in sub-packetization level compared to known rack-aware MSCR codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Demand Private Coded Caching: Small Cache Size](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18242v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the demand private coded caching problem, which is an $(N,K)$ coded caching problem with $N$ files, $K$ users, each equipped with a cache of size $M$, and an additional privacy constraint on user demands, i.e., each user can not gain any information about the demands of other users. We focus on scenarios where the size of users' caches is small, aiming to further characterize the fundamental limits of this problem. We first present a new virtual-user-based achievable scheme for arbitrary number of users and files, and two MDS-code-based achievable schemes for the case $N \le K$. With a newly derived converse bound for the case $N \le K$, these proposed schemes lead to the optimal memory-rate tradeoff of the demand private coded caching problem for $M \in \big[0, \frac{N}{(K+1)(N-1)} \big] $ where $N \le K \le 2N-2$, and the optimal memory-rate tradeoff for $M \in \big[0, \frac{1}{K+1} \big] $ where $ K > 2N-2$. Moreover, for the case of 2 files and arbitrary number of users, by deriving another new converse bound, the optimal memory-rate tradeoff is characterized for $M\in \big[0,\frac{2}{K}\big] \cup \big[\frac{2(K-1)}{K+1},2\big]$. Finally, we provide the optimal memory-rate tradeoff of the demand private coded caching problem for 2 files and 3 users.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning by gaming, coding and making with EDUMING: A new approach to utilising atypical digital games for learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13878v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Papert's constructionism makes it clear that learning is particularly effective when learners create tangible artifacts and share and discuss them in social contexts. Technological progress in recent decades has created numerous opportunities for learners to not only passively consume media, but to actively shape it through construction. This article uses the EDUMING concept to present a new method to simplify the development of digital learning games and thus support their integration into learning situations. A key difference between the concept and established ideas such as game-based learning, gamification, serious games, etc. is that games are not closed and are consumed passively, but can also be actively developed by users individually by modifying the source code with the help of an IDE. As part of an empirical study, the usability of the game "Professor Chip's Learning Quest" (PCLQ) is recorded, as well as previous experience with digital learning games and the acceptance and motivation to use new technologies. The purpose of this article is to test the PCLQ digital learning game, developed according to the EDUMING concept, as part of an exploratory study regarding its usability, acceptance and suitability for use in schools. The study is intended as a first empirical approach to practical testing of the concept.</p></details> | 13 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Optimal Secure Coded Distributed Computation over all Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18038v1)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We construct optimal secure coded distributed schemes that extend the known optimal constructions over fields of characteristic 0 to all fields. A serendipitous result is that we can encode \emph{all} functions over finite fields with a recovery threshold proportional to the complexity (tensor rank or multiplicative); this is due to the well-known result that all functions over a finite field can be represented as multivariate polynomials (or symmetric tensors). We get that a tensor of order $\ell$ (or a multivariate polynomial of degree $\ell$) can be computed in the faulty network of $N$ nodes setting within a factor of $\ell$ and an additive term depending on the genus of a code with $N$ rational points and distance covering the number of faulty servers; in particular, we present a coding scheme for general matrix multiplication of two $m \times m $ matrices with a recovery threshold of $2 m^{\omega } -1+g$ where $\omega $ is the exponent of matrix multiplication which is optimal for coding schemes using AG codes. Moreover, we give sufficient conditions for which the Hadamard-Shur product of general linear codes gives a similar recovery threshold, which we call \textit{log-additive codes}. Finally, we show that evaluation codes with a \textit{curve degree} function (first defined in [Ben-Sasson et al. (STOC '13)]) that have well-behaved zero sets are log-additive.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReasoningV: Efficient Verilog Code Generation with Adaptive Hybrid Reasoning Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14560v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced Verilog code generation significantly, yet face challenges in data quality, reasoning capabilities, and computational efficiency. This paper presents ReasoningV, a novel model employing a hybrid reasoning strategy that integrates trained intrinsic capabilities with dynamic inference adaptation for Verilog code generation. Our framework introduces three complementary innovations: (1) ReasoningV-5K, a high-quality dataset of 5,000 functionally verified instances with reasoning paths created through multi-dimensional filtering of PyraNet samples; (2) a two-stage training approach combining parameter-efficient fine-tuning for foundational knowledge with full-parameter optimization for enhanced reasoning; and (3) an adaptive reasoning mechanism that dynamically adjusts reasoning depth based on problem complexity, reducing token consumption by up to 75\% while preserving performance. Experimental results demonstrate ReasoningV's effectiveness with a pass@1 accuracy of 57.8\% on VerilogEval-human, achieving performance competitive with leading commercial models like Gemini-2.0-flash (59.5\%) and exceeding the previous best open-source model by 10.4 percentage points. ReasoningV offers a more reliable and accessible pathway for advancing AI-driven hardware design automation, with our model, data, and code available at https://github.com/BUAA-CLab/ReasoningV.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Crypto-ncRNA: Non-coding RNA (ncRNA) Based Encryption Algorithm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17878v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the looming post-quantum era, traditional cryptographic systems are increasingly vulnerable to quantum computing attacks that can compromise their mathematical foundations. To address this critical challenge, we propose crypto-ncRNA-a bio-convergent cryptographic framework that leverages the dynamic folding properties of non-coding RNA (ncRNA) to generate high-entropy, quantum-resistant keys and produce unpredictable ciphertexts. The framework employs a novel, multi-stage process: encoding plaintext into RNA sequences, predicting and manipulating RNA secondary structures using advanced algorithms, and deriving cryptographic keys through the intrinsic physical unclonability of RNA molecules. Experimental evaluations indicate that, although crypto-ncRNA's encryption speed is marginally lower than that of AES, it significantly outperforms RSA in terms of efficiency and scalability while achieving a 100% pass rate on the NIST SP 800-22 randomness tests. These results demonstrate that crypto-ncRNA offers a promising and robust approach for securing digital infrastructures against the evolving threats posed by quantum computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AI4NA workshop at ICLR 2025. 18pages, 4figures</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Error Correction with Girth-16 Non-Binary LDPC Codes via Affine Permutation Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17790v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a method for constructing quantum error-correcting codes based on non-binary low-density parity-check codes with girth 16. In conventional constructions using circulant permutation matrices, the girth is upper-bounded by 12, which limits the suppression of harmful short cycles. Our construction employs affine permutation matrices and a randomized sequential selection procedure designed to eliminate short cycles, which are known to limit decoding performance. Joint belief propagation decoding is applied over depolarizing channels. Numerical experiments confirm that the proposed codes reduce the number of low-weight codewords in $C_X \setminus C_Z^\perp$ and $C_Z \setminus C_X^\perp$, and thus have the potential to suppress error floors. In addition, we obtain a significantly improved upper bound on the minimum distance, which we conjecture to be tight.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Grounded Reasoning by Code-Assisted Large Language Models for Mathematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17665v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Assisting LLMs with code generation improved their performance on mathematical reasoning tasks. However, the evaluation of code-assisted LLMs is generally restricted to execution correctness, lacking a rigorous evaluation of their generated programs. In this work, we bridge this gap by conducting an in-depth analysis of code-assisted LLMs' generated programs in response to math reasoning tasks. Our evaluation focuses on the extent to which LLMs ground their programs to math rules, and how that affects their end performance. For this purpose, we assess the generations of five different LLMs, on two different math datasets, both manually and automatically. Our results reveal that the distribution of grounding depends on LLMs' capabilities and the difficulty of math problems. Furthermore, mathematical grounding is more effective for closed-source models, while open-source models fail to employ math rules in their solutions correctly. On MATH500, the percentage of grounded programs decreased to half, while the ungrounded generations doubled in comparison to ASDiv grade-school problems. Our work highlights the need for in-depth evaluation beyond execution accuracy metrics, toward a better understanding of code-assisted LLMs' capabilities and limits in the math domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Function-Correcting Codes for Locally Bounded Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07804v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a class of functions that assume only a limited number $\lambda$ of values within a given Hamming $\rho$-ball and call them locally $(\rho, \lambda)$-bounded functions. We develop function-correcting codes (FCCs) for these functions and propose an upper bound on the redundancy of FCCs. The bound is based on the minimum length of an error-correcting code with a given number of codewords and a minimum distance. Furthermore, we provide a sufficient optimality condition for FCCs when $\lambda =4$. We also demonstrate that any function can be represented as a locally $(\rho, \lambda)$-bounded function, illustrating this with a representation of Hamming weight distribution functions. Furthermore, we present another construction of function-correcting codes for Hamming weight distribution functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>The t...</summary><p>The title has been updated</p></details> |
| **[TSUE: A Two-Stage Data Update Method for an Erasure Coded Cluster File System](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17598v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compared to replication-based storage systems, erasure-coded storage incurs significantly higher overhead during data updates. To address this issue, various parity logging methods have been pro- posed. Nevertheless, due to the long update path and substantial amount of random I/O involved in erasure code update processes, the resulting long latency and low throughput often fail to meet the requirements of high performance applications. To this end, we propose a two-stage data update method called TSUE. TSUE divides the update process into a synchronous stage that records updates in a data log, and an asynchronous stage that recycles the log in real-time. TSUE effectively reduces update latency by transforming random I/O into sequential I/O, and it significantly reduces recycle overhead by utilizing a three-layer log and the spatio-temporal locality of access patterns. In SSDs cluster, TSUE significantly im- proves update performance, achieving improvements of 7.6X under Ali-Cloud trace, 5X under Ten-Cloud trace, while it also extends the SSD's lifespan by up to 13X through reducing the frequencies of reads/writes and of erase operations.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 8 figures, accepted by ACM HPDC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Towards Machine-Generated Code for the Resolution of User Intentions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17531v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing capabilities of Artificial Intelligence (AI), particularly Large Language Models (LLMs), prompt a reassessment of the interaction mechanisms between users and their devices. Currently, users are required to use a set of high-level applications to achieve their desired results. However, the advent of AI may signal a shift in this regard, as its capabilities have generated novel prospects for user-provided intent resolution through the deployment of model-generated code, which is tantamount to the generation of workflows comprising a multitude of interdependent steps. This development represents a significant progression in the realm of hybrid workflows, where human and artificial intelligence collaborate to address user intentions, with the former responsible for defining these intentions and the latter for implementing the solutions to address them. In this paper, we investigate the feasibility of generating and executing workflows through code generation that results from prompting an LLM with a concrete user intention, such as \emph{Please send my car title to my insurance company}, and a simplified application programming interface for a GUI-less operating system. We provide in-depth analysis and comparison of various user intentions, the resulting code, and its execution. The findings demonstrate a general feasibility of our approach and that the employed LLM, GPT-4o-mini, exhibits remarkable proficiency in the generation of code-oriented workflows in accordance with provided user intentions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Subcode Ensemble Decoding of Polar Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17511v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the short block length regime, pre-transformed polar codes together with successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding possess excellent error correction capabilities. However, in practice, the list size is limited due to the suboptimal scaling of the required area in hardware implementations. Automorphism ensemble decoding (AED) can improve performance for a fixed list size by running multiple parallel SCL decodings on permuted received words, yielding a list of estimates from which the final estimate is selected. Yet, AED is limited to appropriately designed polar codes. Subcode ensemble decoding (ScED) was recently proposed for low-density parity-check codes and does not impose such design constraints. It uses multiple decodings in different subcodes, ensuring that the selected subcodes jointly cover the original code. We extend ScED to polar codes by expressing polar subcodes through suitable pre-transformations (PTs). To this end, we describe a framework classifying pre-transformations for pre-transformed polar codes based on their role in encoding and decoding. Within this framework, we propose a new type of PT enabling ScED for polar codes, analyze its properties, and discuss how to construct an efficient ensemble.</p></details> | Submitted to IEEE |
| **[Capacity of Hierarchical Secure Coded Gradient Aggregation with Straggling Communication Links](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.11496v2)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing privacy concerns in distributed learning have led to the widespread adoption of secure aggregation techniques in distributed machine learning systems, such as federated learning. Motivated by a coded gradient aggregation problem in a user-helper-master hierarchical network setting with straggling communication links, we formulate a new secure hierarchical coded gradient aggregation problem. In our setting, \( K \) users communicate with the master through an intermediate layer of \( N \) helpers, who can communicate with each other. With a resiliency threshold of \( N_r \) for straggling communication links, and at most \( T \) colluding helpers and any number of colluding users, the master aims to recover the sum of all users' gradients while remaining unaware of any individual gradient that exceeds the expected sum. In addition, helpers cannot infer more about users' gradients than what is already known by the colluding users. We propose an achievable scheme where users' upload messages are based on a globally known Vandermonde matrix, and helper communication is facilitated using an extended Vandermonde matrix with special structural properties. A matching converse bound is also derived, establishing the optimal result for this hierarchical coded gradient aggregation problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Leveraging Large Language Model Summaries for Topic Modeling in Source Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17426v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding source code is a topic of great interest in the software engineering community, since it can help programmers in various tasks such as software maintenance and reuse. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable program comprehension capabilities, while transformer-based topic modeling techniques offer effective ways to extract semantic information from text. This paper proposes and explores a novel approach that combines these strengths to automatically identify meaningful topics in a corpus of Python programs. Our method consists in applying topic modeling on the descriptions obtained by asking an LLM to summarize the code. To assess the internal consistency of the extracted topics, we compare them against topics inferred from function names alone, and those derived from existing docstrings. Experimental results suggest that leveraging LLM-generated summaries provides interpretable and semantically rich representation of code structure. The promising results suggest that our approach can be fruitfully applied in various software engineering tasks such as automatic documentation and tagging, code search, software reorganization and knowledge discovery in large repositories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coding for Computation: Efficient Compression of Neural Networks for Reconfigurable Hardware](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17403v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As state of the art neural networks (NNs) continue to grow in size, their resource-efficient implementation becomes ever more important. In this paper, we introduce a compression scheme that reduces the number of computations required for NN inference on reconfigurable hardware such as FPGAs. This is achieved by combining pruning via regularized training, weight sharing and linear computation coding (LCC). Contrary to common NN compression techniques, where the objective is to reduce the memory used for storing the weights of the NNs, our approach is optimized to reduce the number of additions required for inference in a hardware-friendly manner. The proposed scheme achieves competitive performance for simple multilayer perceptrons, as well as for large scale deep NNs such as ResNet-34.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 IEEE Statistical Signal Processing (SSP) Workshop, Edinburgh</p></details> |
| **[Error Exponents for DNA Storage Codes with a Variable Number of Reads](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17337v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study error exponents for a concatataned coding based class of DNA storage codes in which the number of reads performed can be variable. That is, the decoder can sequentially perform reads and choose whether to output the final decision or take more reads, and we are interested in minimizing the average number of reads performed rather than a fixed pre-specified value. We show that this flexibility leads to a considerable reduction in the error probability compared to a fixed number of reads, not only in terms of constants in the error exponent but also in the scaling laws. This is shown via an achievability result for a suitably-designed protocol, and in certain parameter regimes we additionally establish a matching converse that holds for all protocols within a broader concatenated coding based class.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cracking the Code of Action: a Generative Approach to Affordances for Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17282v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents that can autonomously navigate the web through a graphical user interface (GUI) using a unified action space (e.g., mouse and keyboard actions) can require very large amounts of domain-specific expert demonstrations to achieve good performance. Low sample efficiency is often exacerbated in sparse-reward and large-action-space environments, such as a web GUI, where only a few actions are relevant in any given situation. In this work, we consider the low-data regime, with limited or no access to expert behavior. To enable sample-efficient learning, we explore the effect of constraining the action space through $\textit{intent-based affordances}$ -- i.e., considering in any situation only the subset of actions that achieve a desired outcome. We propose $\textbf{Code as Generative Affordances}$ $(\textbf{$\texttt{CoGA}$})$, a method that leverages pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) to generate code that determines affordable actions through implicit intent-completion functions and using a fully-automated program generation and verification pipeline. These programs are then used in-the-loop of a reinforcement learning agent to return a set of affordances given a pixel observation. By greatly reducing the number of actions that an agent must consider, we demonstrate on a wide range of tasks in the MiniWob++ benchmark that: $\textbf{1)}$ $\texttt{CoGA}$ is orders of magnitude more sample efficient than its RL agent, $\textbf{2)}$ $\texttt{CoGA}$'s programs can generalize within a family of tasks, and $\textbf{3)}$ $\texttt{CoGA}$ performs better or on par compared with behavior cloning when a small number of expert demonstrations is available.</p></details> |  |
| **[AlphaTrans: A Neuro-Symbolic Compositional Approach for Repository-Level Code Translation and Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.24117v4)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation transforms programs from one programming language (PL) to another. Several rule-based transpilers have been designed to automate code translation between different pairs of PLs. However, the rules can become obsolete as the PLs evolve and cannot generalize to other PLs. Recent studies have explored the automation of code translation using Large Language Models (LLMs). One key observation is that such techniques may work well for crafted benchmarks but fail to generalize to the scale and complexity of real-world projects with dependencies, custom types, PL-specific features, etc. We propose AlphaTrans, a neuro-symbolic approach to automate repository-level code translation. AlphaTrans translates both source and test code, and employs multiple levels of validation to ensure the translation preserves the functionality of the source program. To break down the problem for LLMs, AlphaTrans leverages program analysis to decompose the program into fragments and translates them in the reverse call order. We leveraged AlphaTrans to translate ten real-world open-source projects consisting of <836, 8575, 2719> classes, methods, and tests. AlphaTrans breaks down these projects into 17874 fragments and translates the entire repository. 96.40% of the translated fragments are syntactically correct, and AlphaTrans validates the translations' runtime behavior and functional correctness for 27.03% and 25.14% of fragments. On average, the integrated translation and validation take 34 hours to translate a project, showing its scalability in practice. For the incorrect translations, AlphaTrans generates a report including existing translation, stack trace, test errors, or assertion failures. We provided these artifacts to two developers to fix the translation bugs in four projects. They were able to fix the issues in 20.1 hours on average and achieve all passing tests.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in FSE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Service Rate Regions of MDS Codes & Fractional Matchings in Quasi-uniform Hypergraphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17244v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The service rate region (SRR) has emerged as a critical performance metric for distributed systems that store data redundantly. It measures the system's ability to serve multiple users concurrently. Mathematically, the SRR is a polytope in R^k where each dimension corresponds to the service request rate of one of the k data objects. This paper focuses on systems employing a class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes. For each code in the class, we characterize the k axes intercept points of its SRR, and the smallest standard simplex that includes the SRR. We use these results to show that the SRR grows with the increasing number of systematic columns in the generator matrices. We establish a graph-theoretic framework associating this SRR problem with fractional matchings in quasi-uniform hypergraphs. Identifying the SRR polytope is equivalent to determining a particular image of the fractional-matching polytope. We introduce a notion of Greedy Matching and show that it is sufficient to focus on these matchings to characterize the SRR rather than the entire matching polytope. With these tools, we determine the SRR of a large subset of the considered class of codes. Our results generalize previous characterizations of systematic and non-systematic MDS-coded systems, offering a unified framework for analyzing service rate regions of codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Practitioners' Expectations on Clear Code Review Comments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06515v4)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The code review comment (CRC) is pivotal in the process of modern code review. It provides reviewers with the opportunity to identify potential bugs, offer constructive feedback, and suggest improvements. Clear and concise code review comments (CRCs) facilitate the communication between developers and are crucial to the correct understanding of the identified issues and proposed solutions. Despite the importance of CRCs' clarity, there is still a lack of guidelines on what constitutes a good clarity and how to evaluate it. In this paper, we conduct a comprehensive study on understanding and evaluating the clarity of CRCs. We first derive a set of attributes related to the clarity of CRCs, namely RIE attributes (i.e., Relevance, Informativeness, and Expression), as well as their corresponding evaluation criteria based on our literature review and survey with practitioners. We then investigate the clarity of CRCs in open-source projects written in nine programming languages and find that a large portion (i.e., 28.8%) of the CRCs lack the clarity in at least one of the attributes. Finally, we explore the potential of automatically evaluating the clarity of CRCs by proposing ClearCRC. Experimental results show that ClearCRC with pre-trained language models is promising for effective evaluation of the clarity of CRCs, achieving a balanced accuracy up to 73.04% and a F-1 score up to 94.61%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by 34th ACM SIGSOFT International Symposium on Software Testing and Analysis (ISSTA 2025)</p></details> |
| **[High-Fidelity And Complex Test Data Generation For Real-World SQL Code Generation Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17203v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The demand for high-fidelity test data is paramount in industrial settings where access to production data is largely restricted. Traditional data generation methods often fall short, struggling with low-fidelity and the ability to model complex data structures and semantic relationships that are critical for testing complex SQL code generation services like Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL). In this paper, we address the critical need for generating syntactically correct and semantically ``meaningful'' mock data for complex schema that includes columns with nested structures that we frequently encounter in Google SQL code generation workloads. We highlight the limitations of existing approaches used in production, particularly their inability to handle large and complex schema, as well as the lack of semantically coherent test data that lead to limited test coverage. We demonstrate that by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and incorporating strategic pre- and post-processing steps, we can generate realistic high-fidelity test data that adheres to complex structural constraints and maintains semantic integrity to the test targets (SQL queries/functions). This approach supports comprehensive testing of complex SQL queries involving joins, aggregations, and even deeply nested subqueries, ensuring robust evaluation of SQL code generation services, like NL2SQL and SQL Code Assistant services. Our results demonstrate the practical utility of an out-of-the-box LLM (\textit{gemini}) based test data generation for industrial SQL code generation services where generating realistic test data is essential due to the frequent unavailability of production datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Paper2Code: Automating Code Generation from Scientific Papers in Machine Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17192v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the rapid growth of machine learning research, corresponding code implementations are often unavailable, making it slow and labor-intensive for researchers to reproduce results and build upon prior work. In the meantime, recent Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at understanding scientific documents and generating high-quality code. Inspired by this, we introduce PaperCoder, a multi-agent LLM framework that transforms machine learning papers into functional code repositories. PaperCoder operates in three stages: planning, where it constructs a high-level roadmap, designs the system architecture with diagrams, identifies file dependencies, and generates configuration files; analysis, which focuses on interpreting implementation-specific details; and generation, where modular, dependency-aware code is produced. Moreover, each phase is instantiated through a set of specialized agents designed to collaborate effectively across the pipeline. We then evaluate PaperCoder on generating code implementations from machine learning papers based on both model-based and human evaluations, specifically from the original paper authors, with author-released repositories as ground truth if available. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of PaperCoder in creating high-quality, faithful implementations. Furthermore, it consistently shows strengths in the recently released PaperBench benchmark, surpassing strong baselines by substantial margins.</p></details> |  |
| **[P$_\ell$-Kyber: Packing $\ell$ Plaintexts and Lattice Coding for Kyber](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17185v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we propose a joint design of encoding and encryption processes for KEMs like Kyber, without assuming the independence of the decoding noise entries. Our design features two techniques: ciphertext packing and lattice packing. First, we extend the Peikert-Vaikuntanathan-Waters (PVW) method to the Kyber: $\ell$ plaintexts are packed into a single ciphertext. This scheme is referred to as P$_\ell$-Kyber. We prove that the P$_\ell$-Kyber is IND-CCA secure under the M-LWE hardness assumption. We show that the decryption decoding noise entries across the $\ell$ plaintexts (also known as layers) are mutually independent. Second, we propose a cross-layer lattice encoding scheme for the P$_\ell$-Kyber, where every $\ell$ cross-layer information symbols are encoded to a lattice point. This way we obtain a \emph{coded} P$_\ell$-Kyber, where the decoding noise entries for each lattice point are mutually independent. Therefore, the decryption failure rate (DFR) analysis does not require the assumption of independence among the decryption decoding noise entries. Both DFR and communication cost (CER) are greatly decreased thanks to ciphertext packing and lattice packing. Finally, we demonstrate that with $\ell=24$ and Leech lattice encoder, the proposed coded P$_\ell$-KYBER1024 achieves DFR $<2^{-281}$ and CER $ = 4.6$, i.e., a decrease of CER by $90\%$ compared to KYBER1024.</p></details> | 8 Tables, 1 Figure |
| **[Less is More: Towards Green Code Large Language Models via Unified Structural Pruning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15921v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The extensive application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in generative coding tasks has raised concerns due to their high computational demands and energy consumption. Unlike previous structural pruning methods designed for classification models that deal with lowdimensional classification logits, generative Code LLMs produce high-dimensional token logit sequences, making traditional pruning objectives inherently limited. Moreover, existing single component pruning approaches further constrain the effectiveness when applied to generative Code LLMs. In response, we propose Flab-Pruner, an innovative unified structural pruning method that combines vocabulary, layer, and Feed-Forward Network (FFN) pruning. This approach effectively reduces model parameters while maintaining performance. Additionally, we introduce a customized code instruction data strategy for coding tasks to enhance the performance recovery efficiency of the pruned model. Through extensive evaluations on three state-of-the-art Code LLMs across multiple generative coding tasks, the results demonstrate that Flab-Pruner retains 97% of the original performance after pruning 22% of the parameters and achieves the same or even better performance after post-training. The pruned models exhibit significant improvements in storage, GPU usage, computational efficiency, and environmental impact, while maintaining well robustness. Our research provides a sustainable solution for green software engineering and promotes the efficient deployment of LLMs in real-world generative coding intelligence applications.</p></details> | UNDER REVIEW |

We introduce SWE-PolyBench, a new multi-language benchmark for repository-level, execution-based evaluation of coding agents. SWE-PolyBench contains 2110 instances from 21 repositories and includes tasks in Java (165), JavaScript (1017), TypeScript (729) and Python (199), covering bug fixes, feature additions, and code refactoring. We provide a task and repository-stratified subsample (SWE-PolyBench500) and release an evaluation harness allowing for fully automated evaluation. To enable a more comprehensive comparison of coding agents, this work also presents a novel set of metrics rooted in syntax tree analysis. We evaluate leading open source coding agents on SWE-PolyBench, revealing their strengths and limitations across languages, task types, and complexity classes. Our experiments show that current agents exhibit uneven performances across languages and struggle with complex problems while showing higher performance on simpler tasks. SWE-PolyBench aims to drive progress in developing more versatile and robust AI coding assistants for real-world software engineering.

Existing approaches often formulate code editing as an implicit end-to-end task, omitting the fact that code-editing procedures inherently consist of discrete and explicit steps. Thus, they suffer from suboptimal performance and lack of robustness and generalization. We introduce EditLord, a code editing framework that makes the code transformation steps explicit. Our key insight is to employ a language model (LM) as an inductive learner to extract code editing rules from the training code pairs as concise meta-rule sets. Such rule sets will be manifested for each training sample to augment them for finetuning or assist in prompting- and iterative-based code editing. EditLordoutperforms the state-of-the-art by an average of 22.7% in editing performance and 58.1% in robustness while achieving 20.2% higher functional correctness across critical software engineering and security applications, LM models, and editing modes.</p></details> |  |

However, their effectiveness for Android malware analysis remains underexplored. Decompiled Android malware code presents unique challenges for analysis, due to the malicious logic being buried within a large number of functions and the frequent lack of meaningful function names. This paper presents CAMA, a benchmarking framework designed to systematically evaluate the effectiveness of Code LLMs in Android malware analysis. CAMA specifies structured model outputs to support key malware analysis tasks, including malicious function identification and malware purpose summarization. Built on these, it integrates three domain-specific evaluation metrics (consistency, fidelity, and semantic relevance), enabling rigorous stability and effectiveness assessment and cross-model comparison. We construct a benchmark dataset of 118 Android malware samples from 13 families collected in recent years, encompassing over 7.5 million distinct functions, and use CAMA to evaluate four popular open-source Code LLMs. Our experiments provide insights into how Code LLMs interpret decompiled code and quantify the sensitivity to function renaming, highlighting both their potential and current limitations in malware analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper has been accepted to the 34th ACM SIGSOFT ISSTA Companion (LLMSC Workshop 2025)</p></details> |

Yet, companies with a long history of rapid delivery exist. Our primary aim is to discover how such companies manage to keep their codebases maintainable. Method: we investigate Meta's practices by collaborating with engineers on code quality and by analyzing rich source code change history to reveal a range of practices used for continual improvement of the codebase. In addition, we replicate several aspects of previous industry cases studies investigating the impact of code reengineering. Results: Code improvements at Meta range from completely organic grass-roots done at the initiative of individual engineers, to regularly blocked time and engagement via gamification of Better Engineering (BE) work, to major explicit initiatives aimed at reengineering the complex parts of the codebase or deleting accumulations of dead code. Over 14% of changes are explicitly devoted to code improvement and the developers are given ``badges'' to acknowledge the type of work and the amount of effort. Our investigation to prioritize which parts of the codebase to improve lead to the development of metrics to guide this decision making. Our analysis of the impact of reengineering activities revealed substantial improvements in quality and speed as well as a reduction in code complexity. Overall, such continual improvement is an effective way to develop software with rapid releases, while maintaining high quality.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we aim to enhance and balance the communication reliability in GTWCs by minimizing the sum of error probabilities via joint design of encoders and decoders at the users. We first formulate general encoding/decoding functions, where the user cooperation is captured by the coupling of user encoding processes. The coupling effect renders the encoder/decoder design non-trivial, requiring effective decoding to capture this effect, as well as efficient power management at the encoders within power constraints. To address these challenges, we propose two different two-way coding strategies: linear coding and learning-based coding. For linear coding, we propose optimal linear decoding and discuss new insights on encoding regarding user cooperation to balance reliability. We then propose an efficient algorithm for joint encoder/decoder design. For learning-based coding, we introduce a novel recurrent neural network (RNN)-based coding architecture, where we propose interactive RNNs and a power control layer for encoding, and we incorporate bi-directional RNNs with an attention mechanism for decoding. Through simulations, we show that our two-way coding methodologies outperform conventional channel coding schemes (that do not utilize user cooperation) significantly in sum-error performance. We also demonstrate that our linear coding excels at high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), while our RNN-based coding performs best at low SNRs. We further investigate our two-way coding strategies in terms of power distribution, two-way coding benefit, different coding rates, and block-length gain.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been accepted for publication in the IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |
| **[Case Study: Fine-tuning Small Language Models for Accurate and Private CWE Detection in Python Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16584v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capabilities in understanding and analyzing code for security vulnerabilities, such as Common Weakness Enumerations (CWEs). However, their reliance on cloud infrastructure and substantial computational requirements pose challenges for analyzing sensitive or proprietary codebases due to privacy concerns and inference costs. This work explores the potential of Small Language Models (SLMs) as a viable alternative for accurate, on-premise vulnerability detection. We investigated whether a 350-million parameter pre-trained code model (codegen-mono) could be effectively fine-tuned to detect the MITRE Top 25 CWEs specifically within Python code. To facilitate this, we developed a targeted dataset of 500 examples using a semi-supervised approach involving LLM-driven synthetic data generation coupled with meticulous human review. Initial tests confirmed that the base codegen-mono model completely failed to identify CWEs in our samples. However, after applying instruction-following fine-tuning, the specialized SLM achieved remarkable performance on our test set, yielding approximately 99% accuracy, 98.08% precision, 100% recall, and a 99.04% F1-score. These results strongly suggest that fine-tuned SLMs can serve as highly accurate and efficient tools for CWE detection, offering a practical and privacy-preserving solution for integrating advanced security analysis directly into development workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables.

Existing studies mainly explored the quality, e.g., correctness and security, of AI-generated code, while in real-world software development, the prerequisite is to distinguish AI-generated code from human-written code, which emphasizes the need to explicitly declare AI-generated code by developers. To this end, this study intends to understand the ways developers use to self-declare AI-generated code and explore the reasons why developers choose to self-declare or not. We conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of two phases. In the first phase, we mined GitHub repositories and collected 613 instances of AI-generated code snippets. In the second phase, we conducted a follow-up industrial survey, which received 111 valid responses. Our research revealed the practices followed by developers to self-declare AI-generated code. Most practitioners (76.6%) always or sometimes self-declare AI-generated code. In contrast, other practitioners (23.4%) noted that they never self-declare AI-generated code. The reasons for self-declaring AI-generated code include the need to track and monitor the code for future review and debugging, and ethical considerations. The reasons for not self-declaring AI-generated code include extensive modifications to AI-generated code and the developers' perception that self-declaration is an unnecessary activity. We finally provided guidelines for practitioners to self-declare AI-generated code, addressing ethical and code quality concerns.</p></details> | <details><summary>35 pa...</summary><p>35 pages, 17 images, 8 tables, Manuscript submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[ITERTL: An Iterative Framework for Fine-tuning LLMs for RTL Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.12022v3)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated excellent performance, inspiring researchers to explore their use in automating register transfer level (RTL) code generation and improving hardware design efficiency. However, the existing approaches to fine-tune LLMs for RTL generation typically are conducted on fixed datasets, which do not fully stimulate the capability of LLMs and require large amounts of reference data, which are costly to acquire. To mitigate these issues, we innovatively introduce an iterative training paradigm named ITERTL. During each iteration, samples are drawn from the model trained in the previous cycle. Then these new samples are employed for training in current loop. Furthermore, we introduce a plug-and-play data filtering strategy, thereby encouraging the model to generate high-quality, self-contained code. Our model outperforms GPT4 and state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source models, achieving remarkable 53.8% pass@1 rate on VerilogEval-human benchmark. Under similar conditions of data quantity and quality, our approach significantly outperforms the baseline. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Coding-Enhanced Jamming Approach for Secure Semantic Communication over Wiretap Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16960v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As semantic communication (SemCom) gains increasing attention as a novel communication paradigm, ensuring the security of transmitted semantic information over open wireless channels becomes crucial. Existing secure SemCom solutions often lack explicit control over security. To address this, we propose a coding-enhanced jamming approach for secure SemCom over wiretap channels. This approach integrates deep joint source and channel coding (DeepJSCC) with neural network-based digital modulation, enabling controlled jamming through two-layer superposition coding. The outer constellation sequence encodes the source image, while the inner constellation sequence, derived from a secret image, acts as the jamming signal. By minimizing the mutual information between the outer and inner constellation sequences, the jamming effect is enhanced. The jamming signal is superposed on the outer constellation sequence, preventing the eavesdropper from recovering the source image. The power allocation coefficient (PAC) in the superposition coding can be adjusted to control system security. Experiments show that our approach matches existing methods in security while significantly improving reconstruction performance across varying channel signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and compression ratios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Give LLMs a Security Course: Securing Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation via Knowledge Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16429v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Code Generation (RACG) leverages external knowledge to enhance Large Language Models (LLMs) in code synthesis, improving the functional correctness of the generated code. However, existing RACG systems largely overlook security, leading to substantial risks. Especially, the poisoning of malicious code into knowledge bases can mislead LLMs, resulting in the generation of insecure outputs, which poses a critical threat in modern software development. To address this, we propose a security-hardening framework for RACG systems, CodeGuarder, that shifts the paradigm from retrieving only functional code examples to incorporating both functional code and security knowledge. Our framework constructs a security knowledge base from real-world vulnerability databases, including secure code samples and root cause annotations. For each code generation query, a retriever decomposes the query into fine-grained sub-tasks and fetches relevant security knowledge. To prioritize critical security guidance, we introduce a re-ranking and filtering mechanism by leveraging the LLMs' susceptibility to different vulnerability types. This filtered security knowledge is seamlessly integrated into the generation prompt. Our evaluation shows CodeGuarder significantly improves code security rates across various LLMs, achieving average improvements of 20.12\% in standard RACG, and 31.53\% and 21.91\% under two distinct poisoning scenarios without compromising functional correctness. Furthermore, CodeGuarder demonstrates strong generalization, enhancing security even when the targeted language's security knowledge is lacking. This work presents CodeGuarder as a pivotal advancement towards building secure and trustworthy RACG systems.</p></details> |  |

For the lossy source coding with side-information, also known as the Wyner-Ziv (WZ) problem, a lower bound on the strong converse exponent was derived by Oohama. In this paper, we derive the tight strong converse exponent for the WZ problem; as a special case, we also derive the tight strong converse exponent for the distributed function computation problem. For the converse part, we use the change-of-measure argument developed in the literature and the soft Markov constraint introduced by Oohama; the matching achievability is proved via the Poisson matching approach recently introduced by Li and Anantharam. Our result is build upon the recently derived tight strong converse exponent for the Wyner-Ahlswede-Korner (WAK) problem; however, compared to the WAK problem, more sophisticated argument is needed. As an illustration of the necessity of the soft Markov constraint, we present an example such that the soft Markov constraint is strictly positive.</p></details> | 19 pages, 1 figure |

We present an advanced NLP system leveraging transformer-based architectures to automatically extract defined terms, their definitions, and their scope from the U.S.C. We address the challenges of automatically identifying legal definitions, extracting defined terms, and determining their scope within this complex corpus of over 200,000 pages of federal statutory law. Building upon previous feature-based machine learning methods, our updated model employs domain-specific transformers (Legal-BERT) fine-tuned specifically for statutory texts, significantly improving extraction accuracy. Our work implements a multi-stage pipeline that combines document structure analysis with state-of-the-art language models to process legal text from the XML version of the U.S. Code. Each paragraph is first classified using a fine-tuned legal domain BERT model to determine if it contains a definition. Our system then aggregates related paragraphs into coherent definitional units and applies a combination of attention mechanisms and rule-based patterns to extract defined terms and their jurisdictional scope. The definition extraction system is evaluated on multiple titles of the U.S. Code containing thousands of definitions, demonstrating significant improvements over previous approaches.

| **[Improving Automated Secure Code Reviews: A Synthetic Dataset for Code Vulnerability Flaws](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16310v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automation of code reviews using AI models has garnered substantial attention in the software engineering community as a strategy to reduce the cost and effort associated with traditional peer review processes. These models are typically trained on extensive datasets of real-world code reviews that address diverse software development concerns, including testing, refactoring, bug fixes, performance optimization, and maintainability improvements. However, a notable limitation of these datasets is the under representation of code vulnerabilities, critical flaws that pose significant security risks, with security-focused reviews comprising a small fraction of the data. This scarcity of vulnerability-specific data restricts the effectiveness of AI models in identifying and commenting on security-critical code. To address this issue, we propose the creation of a synthetic dataset consisting of vulnerability-focused reviews that specifically comment on security flaws. Our approach leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate human-like code review comments for vulnerabilities, using insights derived from code differences and commit messages. To evaluate the usefulness of the generated synthetic dataset, we plan to use it to fine-tune three existing code review models. We anticipate that the synthetic dataset will improve the performance of the original code review models.</p></details> | <details><summary>MSR 2...</summary><p>MSR 2025 - Registered Reports</p></details> |
| **[GENCNIPPET: Automated Generation of Code Snippets for Supporting Programming Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16292v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Software developers often ask questions on Technical Q&A forums like Stack Overflow (SO) to seek solutions to their programming-related problems (e.g., errors and unexpected behavior of code). Problem: Many questions miss required code snippets due to the lack of readily available code, time constraints, employer restrictions, confidentiality concerns, or uncertainty about what code to share. Unfortunately, missing but required code snippets prevent questions from getting prompt and appropriate solutions. Objective: We plan to introduce GENCNIPPET, a tool designed to integrate with SO's question submission system. GENCNIPPET will generate relevant code examples (when required) to support questions for their timely solutions. Methodology: We first downloaded the SO April 2024 data dump, which contains 1.94 million questions related to Python that have code snippets and 1.43 million questions related to Java. Then, we filter these questions to identify those that genuinely require code snippets using a state-of-the-art machine learning model. Next, we select questions with positive scores to ensure high-quality data. Our plan is to fine-tune Llama-3 models (e.g., Llama-3-8B), using 80% of the selected questions for training and 10% for validation. The primary reasons for choosing Llama models are their open-source accessibility and robust fine-tuning capabilities, which are essential for deploying a freely accessible tool. GENCNIPPET will be integrated with the SO question submission system as a browser plugin. It will communicate with the fine-tuned model to generate code snippets tailored to the target questions. The effectiveness of the generated code examples will be assessed using automatic evaluation against ground truth, user perspectives, and live (wild) testing in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR 2025 Registered Reports Track)</p></details> |
| **[Coded Downlink Massive Random Access and a Finite de Finetti Theorem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08301v3)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers a massive connectivity setting in which a base-station (BS) aims to communicate sources $(X_1,\cdots,X_k)$ to a randomly activated subset of $k$ users, among a large pool of $n$ users, via a common message in the downlink. Although the identities of the $k$ active users are assumed to be known at the BS, each active user only knows whether itself is active and does not know the identities of the other active users. A naive coding strategy is to transmit the sources alongside the identities of the users for which the source information is intended. This requires $H(X_1,\cdots,X_k) + k\log(n)$ bits, because the cost of specifying the identity of one out of $n$ users is $\log(n)$ bits. For large $n$, this overhead can be significant. This paper shows that it is possible to develop coding techniques that eliminate the dependency of the overhead on $n$, if the source distribution follows certain symmetry. Specifically, if the source distribution is independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) then the overhead can be reduced to at most $O(\log(k))$ bits, and in case of uniform i.i.d. sources, the overhead can be further reduced to $O(1)$ bits. For sources that follow a more general exchangeable distribution, the overhead is at most $O(k)$ bits, and in case of finite-alphabet exchangeable sources, the overhead can be further reduced to $O(\log(k))$ bits. The downlink massive random access problem is closely connected to the study of finite exchangeable sequences. The proposed coding strategy allows bounds on the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence between finite exchangeable distributions and i.i.d. mixture distributions to be developed, and gives a new KL divergence version of the finite de Finetti theorem which is scaling optimal.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 Pa...</summary><p>18 Pages.

| **[A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method for Efficient Finite-Length LDPC Code Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16071v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are among the most prominent error-correction schemes. They find application to fortify various modern storage, communication, and computing systems. Protograph-based (PB) LDPC codes offer many degrees of freedom in the code design and enable fast encoding and decoding. In particular, spatially-coupled (SC) and multi-dimensional (MD) circulant-based codes are PB-LDPC codes with excellent performance. Efficient finite-length (FL) algorithms are required in order to effectively exploit the available degrees of freedom offered by SC partitioning, lifting, and MD relocations. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC or MC$^2$) method to perform this FL optimization, addressing the removal of short cycles. While iterating, we draw samples from a defined distribution where the probability decreases as the number of short cycles from the previous iteration increases. We analyze our MC$^2$ method theoretically as we prove the invariance of the Markov chain where each state represents a possible partitioning or lifting arrangement. Via our simulations, we then fit the distribution of the number of cycles resulting from a given arrangement on a Gaussian distribution. We derive estimates for cycle counts that are close to the actual counts. Furthermore, we derive the order of the expected number of iterations required by our approach to reach a local minimum as well as the size of the Markov chain recurrent class. Our approach is compatible with code design techniques based on gradient-descent. Numerical results show that our MC$^2$ method generates SC codes with remarkably less number of short cycles compared with the current state-of-the-art. Moreover, to reach the same number of cycles, our method requires orders of magnitude less overall time compared with the available literature methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages (double column), 0 figures, submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Communications (TCOM)</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking LLM for Code Smells Detection: OpenAI GPT-4.0 vs DeepSeek-V3](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16027v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Determining the most effective Large Language Model for code smell detection presents a complex challenge. This study introduces a structured methodology and evaluation matrix to tackle this issue, leveraging a curated dataset of code samples consistently annotated with known smells. The dataset spans four prominent programming languages Java, Python, JavaScript, and C++; allowing for cross language comparison. We benchmark two state of the art LLMs, OpenAI GPT 4.0 and DeepSeek-V3, using precision, recall, and F1 score as evaluation metrics. Our analysis covers three levels of detail: overall performance, category level performance, and individual code smell type performance. Additionally, we explore cost effectiveness by comparing the token based detection approach of GPT 4.0 with the pattern-matching techniques employed by DeepSeek V3. The study also includes a cost analysis relative to traditional static analysis tools such as SonarQube. The findings offer valuable guidance for practitioners in selecting an efficient, cost effective solution for automated code smell detection</p></details> |  |
| **[Token-Aware Coding Flow: A Study with Nano Surge in Reasoning Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15989v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of large-scale language models (LLMs) in software engineering, the Chain of Thought (CoT) approach has emerged as a crucial tool for driving automated code generation and optimization. However, despite the significant success of CoT methods in generating high-quality code, the issue of token inflation during the reasoning process remains a formidable challenge to model performance and efficiency, particularly when dealing with complex code smells. Code smells not only affect the maintainability and scalability of code but also significantly increase the computational burden during LLM inference, leading to excessive token consumption and, consequently, reduced reasoning efficiency. This paper introduces an innovative Token-Aware Coding Flow method, aimed at addressing the token inflation problem caused by smelly code in the CoT process. Through experimentation, we validate the synergistic effect of code refactoring and prompt engineering strategies, demonstrating that after eliminating code smells, token consumption during model inference is significantly reduced. The experimental results show that refactored code, while maintaining functional consistency, can reduce token consumption by up to 50\%. Additionally, by explicitly prompting the type of code smells in the prompt and incorporating strategies such as context awareness and role constraints, we further optimize the reasoning process, achieving a 24.5\% to 30\% reduction in token consumption. These optimizations not only significantly enhance the model's reasoning efficiency and improve code generation quality but also provide new insights for addressing performance bottlenecks in complex code generation tasks.</p></details> | 11 pages, 10 figures |

| **[Inducing Vulnerable Code Generation in LLM Coding Assistants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15867v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Due to insufficient domain knowledge, LLM coding assistants often reference related solutions from the Internet to address programming problems. However, incorporating external information into LLMs' code generation process introduces new security risks. In this paper, we reveal a real-world threat, named HACKODE, where attackers exploit referenced external information to embed attack sequences, causing LLMs to produce code with vulnerabilities such as buffer overflows and incomplete validations. We designed a prototype of the attack, which generates effective attack sequences for potential diverse inputs with various user queries and prompt templates. Through the evaluation on two general LLMs and two code LLMs, we demonstrate that the attack is effective, achieving an 84.29% success rate. Additionally, on a real-world application, HACKODE achieves 75.92% ASR, demonstrating its real-world impact.</p></details> |  |
| **[Effective Application of Normalized Min-Sum Decoding for Short BCH Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.20828v3)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces an enhanced normalized min-sum decoder designed to address the performance and complexity challenges associated with developing parallelizable decoders for short BCH codes in high-throughput applications. The decoder optimizes the standard parity-check matrix using heuristic binary summation and random cyclic row shifts, resulting in a Tanner graph with low density, controlled redundancy, and minimized length-4 cycles. The impact of row redundancy and rank deficiency in the dual code's minimum-weight codewords on decoding performance is analyzed. To improve convergence, three random automorphisms are applied simultaneously to the inputs, with the resulting messages merged at the end of each iteration. Extensive simulations demonstrate that, for BCH codes with block lengths of 63 and 127, the enhanced normalized min-sum decoder achieves a 1-2 dB performance gain and 100X faster convergence compared to existing parallel and iterative decoders. Additionally, a hybrid decoding scheme is proposed, which selectively activates order statistics decoding when the enhanced normalized min-sum decoder fails. This hybrid approach is shown to approach maximum-likelihood performance while retaining the advantages of the normalized min-sum decoder across a broad SNR range.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Code size constraints in b-symbol read channels: A bound analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10088v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In classical coding theory, error-correcting codes are designed to protect against errors occurring at individual symbol positions in a codeword. However, in practical storage and communication systems, errors often affect multiple adjacent symbols rather than single symbols independently. To address this, symbol-pair read channels were introduced \cite{Yuval2011}, and later generalized to $b$-symbol read channels \cite{yaakobi2016} to better model such error patterns. $b$-Symbol read channels generalize symbol-pair read channels to account for clustered errors in modern storage and communication systems. By developing bounds and efficient codes, researchers improve data reliability in applications such as storage devices, wireless networks, and DNA-based storage. Given integers $q$, $n$, $d$, and $b \geq 2$, let $A_b(n,d,q)$ denote the largest possible code size for which there exists a $q$-ary code of length $n$ with minimum $b$-symbol distance at least $d$. In \cite{chen2022}, various upper and lower bounds on $A_b(n,d,q)$ are given for $b=2$. In this paper, we generalize some of these bounds to the $b$-symbol read channels for $b>2$ and present several new bounds on $A_b(n,d,q)$. In particular, we establish the linear programming bound, a recurrence relation on $A_b(n,d,q)$, the Johnson bound (even), the restricted Johnson bound, the Gilbert-Varshamov-type bound, and the Elias bound for the metric of symbols $b$, $b\geq 2$. Furthermore, we provide examples demonstrating that the Gilbert-Varshamov bound we establish offers a stronger lower bound than the one presented in \cite{Song2018}. Additionally, we introduce an alternative approach to deriving the Sphere-packing and Plotkin bounds.</p></details> |  |
| **[VeriCoder: Enhancing LLM-Based RTL Code Generation through Functional Correctness Validation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15659v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have sparked growing interest in applying them to Electronic Design Automation (EDA) tasks, particularly Register Transfer Level (RTL) code generation. While several RTL datasets have been introduced, most focus on syntactic validity rather than functional validation with tests, leading to training examples that compile but may not implement the intended behavior. We present VERICODER, a model for RTL code generation fine-tuned on a dataset validated for functional correctness. This fine-tuning dataset is constructed using a novel methodology that combines unit test generation with feedback-directed refinement. Given a natural language specification and an initial RTL design, we prompt a teacher model (GPT-4o-mini) to generate unit tests and iteratively revise the RTL design based on its simulation results using the generated tests. If necessary, the teacher model also updates the tests to ensure they comply with the natural language specification. As a result of this process, every example in our dataset is functionally validated, consisting of a natural language description, an RTL implementation, and passing tests. Fine-tuned on this dataset of over 125,000 examples, VERICODER achieves state-of-the-art metrics in functional correctness on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with relative gains of up to 71.7% and 27.4% respectively. An ablation study further shows that models trained on our functionally validated dataset outperform those trained on functionally non-validated datasets, underscoring the importance of high-quality datasets in RTL code generation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we closely examine the reasons behind this phenomenon, focusing on the pre-training corpus. We find that the existence of code-switching, alternating between different languages within a context, is key to multilingual capabilities. We conduct an analysis to investigate code-switching in the pre-training corpus, examining its presence and categorizing it into four types within two quadrants. We then assess its impact on multilingual performance. These types of code-switching data are unbalanced in proportions and demonstrate different effects on facilitating language transfer. To better explore the power of code-switching for language alignment during pre-training, we investigate the strategy of synthetic code-switching. We continuously scale up the synthetic code-switching data and observe remarkable improvements in both benchmarks and representation space. Extensive experiments indicate that incorporating synthetic code-switching data enables better language alignment and generalizes well to high, medium, and low-resource languages with pre-training corpora of varying qualities.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing benchmarks focus on isolated functions and fail to capture the complexity of real-world, class-level software structures. To address this gap, we introduce a large-scale, Python class-level dataset curated from $13{,}174$ real-world open-source projects. The dataset contains over 842,000 class skeletons, each including class and method signatures, along with associated docstrings when available. We preserve structural and contextual dependencies critical to realistic software development scenarios and enrich the dataset with static code metrics to support downstream analysis. To evaluate the usefulness of this dataset, we use extracted class skeletons as prompts for GPT-4 to generate full class implementations. Results show that the LLM-generated classes exhibit strong lexical and structural similarity to human-written counterparts, with average ROUGE@L, BLEU, and TSED scores of 0.80, 0.59, and 0.73, respectively. These findings confirm that well-structured prompts derived from real-world class skeletons significantly enhance LLM performance in class-level code generation. This dataset offers a valuable resource for benchmarking, training, and improving LLMs in realistic software engineering contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was submitted to the 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE 2025) AI models/data track</p></details> |

This condition imposes a less stringent distance requirement than classical error-correcting codes (ECCs), allowing for reduced redundancy. FCCs were introduced by Lenz et al. (2021), who also established a lower bound on the optimal redundancy for FCCs over the binary field. Here, we derive an upper bound within a logarithmic factor of this lower bound. We show that the same lower bound holds for any finite field. Moreover, we show that this bound is tight for sufficiently large fields by demonstrating that it also serves as an upper bound. Furthermore, we construct an encoding scheme that achieves this optimal redundancy. Finally, motivated by these two extreme regimes, we conjecture that our bound serves as a valid upper bound across all finite fields.</p></details> | <details><summary>Remov...</summary><p>Remove 1 redundant page at the end.

Fortran has served as one of the go to programming languages in legacy high-performance computing (HPC) for scientific discoveries.

Here, we studied the applicability of LLM-based translation of Fortran to C++ as a step towards building an agentic-workflow using open-weight LLMs on two different computational platforms. We statistically quantified the compilation accuracy of the translated C++ codes, measured the similarity of the LLM translated code to the human translated C++ code, and statistically quantified the output similarity of the Fortran to C++ translation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Capacity on BMS Channels via Code Symmetry and Nesting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15394v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The past decade has seen notable advances in our understanding of structured error-correcting codes, particularly binary Reed--Muller (RM) codes. While initial breakthroughs were for erasure channels based on symmetry, extending these results to the binary symmetric channel (BSC) and other binary memoryless symmetric (BMS) channels required new tools and conditions. Recent work uses nesting to obtain multiple weakly correlated "looks" that imply capacity-achieving performance under bit-MAP and block-MAP decoding. This paper revisits and extends past approaches, aiming to simplify proofs, unify insights, and remove unnecessary conditions. By leveraging powerful results from the analysis of boolean functions, we derive recursive bounds using two or three looks at each stage. This gives bounds on the bit error probability that decay exponentially in the number of stages. For the BSC, we incorporate level-k inequalities and hypercontractive techniques to achieve the faster decay rate required for vanishing block error probability. The results are presented in a semitutorial style, providing both theoretical insights and practical implications for future research on structured codes.</p></details> | 35 pages, 1 figure |

We also present a section on two-dimensional cyclic codes in the quotient ring $\mathbb{F}_q[x, y] / \langle x^{l} - 1, y^{m} - 1 \rangle$. These two-dimensional cyclic codes can be analyzed using the group ring $\mathbb{F}_q(C_{l} \times C_{m})$, where $C_{l}$ and $C_{m}$ represent cyclic groups of orders $l$ and $m$, respectively. The aim is to show that studying group ring codes provides a more compact approach compared to the quotient ring method. We further extend this group ring framework to study codes over other group structures, such as the dihedral group, direct products of cyclic and dihedral groups, direct products of two cyclic groups, and semidirect products of two groups. Additionally, we explore necessary and sufficient conditions for such group ring codes to be self-orthogonal under Euclidean, Hermitian, and symplectic inner products and propose a construction for quantum codes.</p></details> |  |

| **[Empowering AI to Generate Better AI Code: Guided Generation of Deep Learning Projects with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15080v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) have been widely applied to code generation, they struggle with generating entire deep learning projects, which are characterized by complex structures, longer functions, and stronger reliance on domain knowledge than general-purpose code. An open-domain LLM often lacks coherent contextual guidance and domain expertise for specific projects, making it challenging to produce complete code that fully meets user requirements. In this paper, we propose a novel planning-guided code generation method, DLCodeGen, tailored for generating deep learning projects. DLCodeGen predicts a structured solution plan, offering global guidance for LLMs to generate the project. The generated plan is then leveraged to retrieve semantically analogous code samples and subsequently abstract a code template. To effectively integrate these multiple retrieval-augmented techniques, a comparative learning mechanism is designed to generate the final code. We validate the effectiveness of our approach on a dataset we build for deep learning code generation. Experimental results demonstrate that DLCodeGen outperforms other baselines, achieving improvements of 9.7% in CodeBLEU and 3.6% in human evaluation metrics.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, when Gagie and Nekrich's algorithm is modified for adaptive alphabetic prefix-free coding its decoding time slows down to $O (\log \log n)$ per character, but ours can be modified for this problem with no asymptotic slowdown. As far as we know, this gives the first algorithm for this alphabetic problem that is simultaneously worst-case optimal in terms of encoding and decoding time and of encoding length.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we investigate to which degree refactorings for deprecated Java APIs can be automated, and quantify the benefit of Javadoc code hints for this task. To this end, we build a symbolic and a neural engine for the automatic refactoring of deprecated APIs. The former is based on type-directed and component-based program synthesis, whereas the latter uses LLMs. We applied our engines to refactor the deprecated methods in the Oracle JDK 15. Our experiments show that code hints are enabling for the automation of this task: even the worst engine correctly refactors 71% of the tasks with code hints, which drops to at best 14% on tasks without. Adding more code hints to Javadoc can hence boost the refactoring of code that uses deprecated APIs.</p></details> |  |

Students use LLMs to assist them in programming courses, including generating source code. Previous work has evaluated the ability of LLMs in solving introductory-course programming assignments. The results have shown that LLMs are highly effective in generating code for introductory Computer Science (CS) courses. However, there is a gap in research on evaluating LLMs' ability to generate code that solves advanced programming assignments. In this work, we evaluate the ability of four LLM tools to solve programming assignments from advanced CS courses in three popular programming languages, Java, Python, and C. We manually select 12 problems, three problems from introductory courses as the baseline and nine programming assignments from second- and third-year CS courses. To evaluate the LLM-generated code, we generate a test suite of 1000 test cases per problem and analyze the program output. Our evaluation shows that although LLMs are highly effective in generating source code for introductory programming courses, solving advanced programming assignments is more challenging. Nonetheless, in many cases, LLMs identify the base problem and provide partial solutions that may be useful to CS students. Furthermore, our results may provide useful guidance for teachers of advanced programming courses on how to design programming assignments.</p></details> |  |

However, these LLMs can be leveraged by attackers to create malicious software, which may pose potential threats to the software ecosystem. For example, they can automate the creation of advanced phishing malware. To address this issue, we first conduct an empirical study and design a prompt dataset, MCGTest, which involves approximately 400 person-hours of work and consists of 406 malicious code generation tasks. Utilizing this dataset, we propose MCGMark, the first robust, code structure-aware, and encodable watermarking approach to trace LLM-generated code. We embed encodable information by controlling the token selection and ensuring the output quality based on probabilistic outliers. Additionally, we enhance the robustness of the watermark by considering the structural features of malicious code, preventing the embedding of the watermark in easily modified positions, such as comments. We validate the effectiveness and robustness of MCGMark on the DeepSeek-Coder. MCGMark achieves an embedding success rate of 88.9% within a maximum output limit of 400 tokens. Furthermore, it also demonstrates strong robustness and has minimal impact on the quality of the output code. Our approach assists SSPs in tracing and holding responsible parties accountable for malicious code generated by LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[APIRAT: Integrating Multi-source API Knowledge for Enhanced Code Translation with LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14852v1)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation is an essential task in software migration, multilingual development, and system refactoring. Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in this task. However, prior studies have highlighted that LLMs often struggle with domain-specific code, particularly in resolving cross-lingual API mappings. To tackle this challenge, we propose APIRAT, a novel code translation method that integrates multi-source API knowledge. APIRAT employs three API knowledge augmentation techniques, including API sequence retrieval, API sequence back-translation, and API mapping, to guide LLMs to translating code, ensuring both the correct structure of API sequences and the accurate usage of individual APIs. Extensive experiments on two public datasets, CodeNet and AVATAR, indicate that APIRAT significantly surpasses existing LLM-based methods, achieving improvements in computational accuracy ranging from 4% to 15.1%. Additionally, our evaluation across different LLMs showcases the generalizability of APIRAT. An ablation study further confirms the individual contributions of each API knowledge component, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by COMPSAC2025</p></details> |

We discover that the MAP forward and backward decoding can be implemented by the corresponding dual soft input and soft output (SISO) encoders using shift registers. The bidrectional MAP decoding output can be obtained by combining the contents of respective forward and backward dual encoders. Represented using simple shift-registers, LMAP decoder maps naturally to hardware registers and thus can be easily implemented. Simulation results demonstrate that the LMAP decoding achieves the same performance as the BCJR MAP decoding, but has a significantly reduced decoding delay. For the block length 64, the CC of the memory length 14 with LMAP decoding surpasses the random coding union (RCU) bound by approximately 0.5 dB at a BLER of $10^{-3}$, and closely approaches both the normal approximation (NA) and meta-converse (MC) bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ISIT 2025</p></details> |

They provide an optimal trade-off between these two factors, making them suitable for demanding communication and storage systems, post-quantum cryptography, radar and sonar systems, wireless sensor networks, and space communications. This paper aims to investigate cyclic codes by an efficient approach introduced by Ding \cite{SETA5} from several known classes of permutation monomials and trinomials over $\mathbb{F}_{2^m}$. We present several infinite families of binary cyclic codes of length $2^m-1$ with dimensions larger than $(2^m-1)/2$. By applying the Hartmann-Tzeng bound, some of the lower bounds on the minimum distances of these cyclic codes are relatively close to the square root bound. Moreover, we obtain a new infinite family of optimal binary cyclic codes with parameters $[2^m-1,2^m-2-3m,8]$, where $m\geq 5$ is odd, according to the sphere-packing bound.</p></details> |  |
| **[DMPCN: Dynamic Modulated Predictive Coding Network with Hybrid Feedback Representations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14665v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Traditional predictive coding networks, inspired by theories of brain function, consistently achieve promising results across various domains, extending their influence into the field of computer vision. However, the performance of the predictive coding networks is limited by their error feedback mechanism, which traditionally employs either local or global recurrent updates, leading to suboptimal performance in processing both local and broader details simultaneously. In addition, traditional predictive coding networks face difficulties in dynamically adjusting to the complexity and context of varying input data, which is crucial for achieving high levels of performance in diverse scenarios. Furthermore, there is a gap in the development and application of specific loss functions that could more effectively guide the model towards optimal performance. To deal with these issues, this paper introduces a hybrid prediction error feedback mechanism with dynamic modulation for deep predictive coding networks by effectively combining global contexts and local details while adjusting feedback based on input complexity. Additionally, we present a loss function tailored to this framework to improve accuracy by focusing on precise prediction error minimization. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of our model over other approaches, showcasing faster convergence and higher predictive accuracy in CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, MNIST, and FashionMNIST datasets.</p></details> |  |

By curating LeetCode Python problems with rich metadata, broad coverage, 100+ test cases per problem, and temporal splits (pre/post July 2024), our dataset enables contamination-free evaluation and efficient supervised fine-tuning (SFT). Experiments show reasoning models significantly outperform non-reasoning counterparts, while SFT with only 2.6K model-generated solutions achieves performance comparable to 110K-sample counterparts. The dataset and evaluation framework are available on Hugging Face and Github.</p></details> |  |
| **[Risk Assessment Framework for Code LLMs via Leveraging Internal States](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14640v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The pre-training paradigm plays a key role in the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), which have been recognized as one of the most significant advancements of AI recently. Building on these breakthroughs, code LLMs with advanced coding capabilities bring huge impacts on software engineering, showing the tendency to become an essential part of developers' daily routines. However, the current code LLMs still face serious challenges related to trustworthiness, as they can generate incorrect, insecure, or unreliable code. Recent exploratory studies find that it can be promising to detect such risky outputs by analyzing LLMs' internal states, akin to how the human brain unconsciously recognizes its own mistakes. Yet, most of these approaches are limited to narrow sub-domains of LLM operations and fall short of achieving industry-level scalability and practicability. To address these challenges, in this paper, we propose PtTrust, a two-stage risk assessment framework for code LLM based on internal state pre-training, designed to integrate seamlessly with the existing infrastructure of software companies. The core idea is that the risk assessment framework could also undergo a pre-training process similar to LLMs. Specifically, PtTrust first performs unsupervised pre-training on large-scale unlabeled source code to learn general representations of LLM states. Then, it uses a small, labeled dataset to train a risk predictor. We demonstrate the effectiveness of PtTrust through fine-grained, code line-level risk assessment and demonstrate that it generalizes across tasks and different programming languages. Further experiments also reveal that PtTrust provides highly intuitive and interpretable features, fostering greater user trust. We believe PtTrust makes a promising step toward scalable and trustworthy assurance for code LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the 33rd ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE Companion'25 Industry Track), June 23-28, 2025, Trondheim, Norway.

| **[Semantic HARQ for Intelligent Transportation Systems: Joint Source-Channel Coding-Powered Reliable Retransmissions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14615v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The surge of data traffic in Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) places a significant challenge on limited wireless resources. Semantic communication, which transmits essential semantics of the raw data, offers a promising solution by reducing redundancy and improving spectrum efficiency. However, high vehicle mobility, dynamic channel conditions, and dense vehicular networks severely impact transmission reliability in ITS. To address these limitations, we integrate Hybrid Automatic Repeat reQuest (HARQ) with Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) to provide reliable semantic communications for ITS. To counteract the adverse effects of time-varying fading channels and noise, we propose a generative signal reconstructor module supported by a local knowledge base, which employs a discriminator for channel error detection and a conditional generative network for error correction. We propose three innovative semantic HARQ (sem-HARQ) schemes, Type I sem-HARQ (sem-HARQ-I), sem-HARQ with weighted combining (sem-HARQ-WC), and sem-HARQ with synonymous combining (sem-HARQ-SC) to enable reliable JSCC-based semantic communications. At the transmitter, both sem-HARQ-I and sem-HARQ-WC retransmit the same semantic signals, while sem-HARQ-SC introduces redundant semantics across different HARQ rounds through synonymous mapping. At the receiver, sem-HARQ-I performs semantic decoding based solely on the currently received signal. In contrast, sem-HARQ-WC enhances reliability by fusing the current received semantic signal with prior erroneous signals at the feature or decision level, thereby exploiting semantic information from failed HARQ rounds. Similarly, sem-HARQ-SC employs feature-level combining, leveraging incremental semantic redundancy to merge semantic features from retransmissions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bounds and Optimal Constructions of Generalized Merge-Convertible Codes for Code Conversion into LRCs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09580v2)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Error-correcting codes are essential for ensuring fault tolerance in modern distributed data storage systems. However, in practice, factors such as the failure rates of storage devices can vary significantly over time, resulting in changes to the optimal code parameters. To reduce storage cost while maintaining efficiency, Maturana and Rashmi introduced a theoretical framework known as code conversion, which enables dynamic adjustment of code parameters according to device performance. In this paper, we focus exclusively on the bounds and constructions of generalized merge-convertible codes. First, we establish a new lower bound on the access cost when the final code is an $(r,\delta)$-LRC. This bound unifies and generalizes all previously known bounds for merge conversion, where the initial and final codes are either LRCs or MDS codes. We then construct a family of access-optimal MDS convertible codes by leveraging subgroups of the automorphism group of a rational function field. It is worth noting that our construction is also per-symbol read access-optimal. Next, we further extend our MDS-based construction to design access-optimal convertible codes for the conversion between $(r,\delta)$-LRCs with parameters that have not been previously reported. Finally, using the parity-check matrix approach, we present a construction of access-optimal convertible codes that enable merge conversion from MDS codes to an $(r,\delta)$-LRC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first explicit optimal construction of code conversion between MDS codes and LRCs. All of our constructions are performed over finite fields whose sizes grow linearly with the code length.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing LLM-based Quantum Code Generation with Multi-Agent Optimization and Quantum Error Correction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14557v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent frameworks with Large Language Models (LLMs) have become promising tools for generating general-purpose programming languages using test-driven development, allowing developers to create more accurate and robust code. However, their potential has not been fully unleashed for domain-specific programming languages, where specific domain exhibits unique optimization opportunities for customized improvement. In this paper, we take the first step in exploring multi-agent code generation for quantum programs. By identifying the unique optimizations in quantum designs such as quantum error correction, we introduce a novel multi-agent framework tailored to generating accurate, fault-tolerant quantum code. Each agent in the framework focuses on distinct optimizations, iteratively refining the code using a semantic analyzer with multi-pass inference, alongside an error correction code decoder. We also examine the effectiveness of inference-time techniques, like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in the context of quantum programming, uncovering observations that are different from general-purpose code generation. To evaluate our approach, we develop a test suite to measure the impact each optimization has on the accuracy of the generated code. Our findings indicate that techniques such as structured CoT significantly improve the generation of quantum algorithms by up to 50%. In contrast, we have also found that certain techniques such as RAG show limited improvement, yielding an accuracy increase of only 4%. Moreover, we showcase examples of AI-assisted quantum error prediction and correction, demonstrating the effectiveness of our multi-agent framework in reducing the quantum errors of generated quantum programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted by DAC'25</p></details> |

The quantum language we are considering can be seen as an extension of PCF, featuring unbounded recursion. The language admits classical and quantum data, as well as a tick operator to account for costs. Our quantum expectation transformer translates such programs into a functional, non-quantum language, enriched with a type and operations over so called cost-structures. By specializing the cost-structure, this methodology makes it possible to study several expectation based properties of quantum programs, such as average case cost, probabilities of events or expected values, in terms of the translated non-quantum programs, this way enabling classical reasoning techniques. As a show-case, we adapt a refinement type system, capable of reasoning on upper-bounds.</p></details> |  |

However, effectively leveraging accelerator capabilities is not always simple: low-level programming toolkits may require substantial developer effort while high-level programming toolkits may abstract critical optimization features. This work aims to increase efficiency of designers using IRON, a toolkit for close-to-metal NPU performance engineers. We provide an updated programmer interface to IRON containing new and refined programming constructs. The new interface includes extensible features for placement and data transformation. These contributions are evaluated in terms of 1) efficiency, with analysis showing ~26% average reduction in lines of code and decreases in Halstead metrics for a variety of designs; 2) expressivity, demonstrating the new interface supports the wide range of features and patterns already supported by IRON; and 3) extensibility, illustrating the new tooling for placement and tiling can be extended to accommodate common use-cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted FCCM 25; artifact submitted for evaluation.

| **[The Road to Hybrid Quantum Programs: Characterizing the Evolution from Classical to Hybrid Quantum Software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11450v3)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing exhibits the unique capability to natively and efficiently encode various natural phenomena, promising theoretical speedups of several orders of magnitude. However, not all computational tasks can be efficiently executed on quantum machines, giving rise to hybrid systems, where some portions of an application run on classical machines, while others utilize quantum resources. Efforts to identify quantum candidate code fragments that can meaningfully execute on quantum machines primarily rely on static code analysis. Yet, the state-of-the-art in static code analysis for quantum candidates remains in its infancy, with limited applicability to specific frameworks and languages, and a lack of generalizability. Existing methods often involve a trial-and-error approach, relying on the intuition and expertise of computer scientists, resulting in varying identification durations ranging from minutes to days for a single application. This paper aims to systematically formalize the process of identifying quantum candidates and their proper encoding within classical programs. Our work addresses the critical initial step in the development of automated reasoning techniques for code-to-code translation, laying the foundation for more efficient quantum software engineering. Particularly, this study investigates a sociotechnical phenomenon where the starting point is not a problem directly solvable with QC, but rather an existing classical program that addresses the problem. In doing so, it underscores the interdisciplinary nature of QC application development, necessitating collaboration between domain experts, computer scientists, and physicists to harness the potential of quantum computing effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the Second International Workshop on Quantum Software Engineering: The Next Evolution</p></details> |
| **[Certifying solutions of degenerate semidefinite programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.13625v3)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper deals with the algorithmic aspects of solving feasibility problems of semidefinite programming (SDP), aka linear matrix inequalities (LMI). Since in some SDP instances all feasible solutions have irrational entries, numerical solvers that work with rational numbers can only find an approximate solution. We study the following question: is it possible to certify feasibility of a given SDP using an approximate solution that is sufficiently close to some exact solution? Existing approaches make the assumption that there exist rational feasible solutions (and use techniques such as rounding and lattice reduction algorithms). We propose an alternative approach that does not need this assumption. More specifically, we show how to construct a system of polynomial equations whose set of real solutions is guaranteed to have an isolated correct solution (assuming that the target exact solution is maximum-rank). This allows, in particular, to use algorithms from real algebraic geometry for solving systems of polynomial equations, yielding a hybrid (or symbolic-numerical) method for SDPs. We experimentally compare it with a pure symbolic method; the hybrid method was able to certify feasibility of many SDP instances on which the exact method failed. Our approach may have further applications, such as refining an approximate solution using methods of numerical algebraic geometry for systems of polynomial equations.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 1 table; accepted to SIAM J.

Understanding How Developers Build Software Containing Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12447v2)** | 2025-04-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative pre-trained models power intelligent software features used by millions of users controlled by developer-written natural language prompts. Despite the impact of prompt-powered software, little is known about its development process and its relationship to programming. In this work, we argue that some prompts are programs and that the development of prompts is a distinct phenomenon in programming known as "prompt programming". We develop an understanding of prompt programming using Straussian grounded theory through interviews with 20 developers engaged in prompt development across a variety of contexts, models, domains, and prompt structures. We contribute 15 observations to form a preliminary understanding of current prompt programming practices. For example, rather than building mental models of code, prompt programmers develop mental models of the foundation model (FM)'s behavior on the prompt by interacting with the FM. While prior research shows that experts have well-formed mental models, we find that prompt programmers who have developed dozens of prompts still struggle to develop reliable mental models. Our observations show that prompt programming differs from traditional software development, motivating the creation of prompt programming tools and providing implications for software engineering stakeholders.</p></details> | Accepted to FSE'25 |

However, most existing code generation models mainly focus on a single or a few programming languages, resulting in unsatisfactory performance in a multilingual environment. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning can significantly improve the performance of the model without the need for retraining or fine-tuning the code generation model by reasonably decomposing complex code generation tasks into multiple subtasks and gradually deriving solutions for each subtask. Nevertheless, the existing CoT generation methods mainly concentrate on Python code, and the performance on other programming languages remains unclear. To fill this gap, we first constructed a CoT generation dataset for 12 programming languages through multi-agent technology. On this basis, we proposed a CoT generation method MSCoT applicable to multiple programming languages. By introducing CoT into the code generation large model, the performance of the code generation large model in a multilingual environment can be improved. Through large-scale empirical research, we compared the generalization abilities of MSCoT and the existing CoT generation methods on multiple programming languages and proved the effectiveness of MSCoT for multiple programming languages. In addition, we also designed a human study to prove the quality of the CoT generated by MSCoT. Finally, we opensourced the model and dataset of MSCoT to promote the research on CoT generation for multiple programming languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted in ijcnn 2025</p></details> |

Our work extends BIT1 hybrid parallelization by integrating MPI with OpenMP and OpenACC, focusing on asynchronous multi-GPU programming. Results show significant performance gains: 16 MPI ranks plus OpenMP threads reduced runtime by 53% on a petascale EuroHPC supercomputer, while OpenACC multicore achieved a 58% reduction. At 64 MPI ranks, OpenACC outperformed OpenMP, improving the particle mover function by 24%. On MareNostrum 5, OpenACC async(n) delivered strong performance, but OpenMP asynchronous multi-GPU approach proved more effective at extreme scaling, maintaining efficiency up to 400 GPUs. Speedup and parallel efficiency (PE) studies revealed OpenMP asynchronous multi-GPU achieving 8.77x speedup (54.81% PE), surpassing OpenACC (8.14x speedup, 50.87% PE). While PE declined at high node counts due to communication overhead, asynchronous execution mitigated scalability bottlenecks. OpenMP nowait and depend clauses improved GPU performance via efficient data transfer and task management. Using NVIDIA Nsight tools, we confirmed BIT1 efficiency for large-scale plasma simulations. OpenMP asynchronous multi-GPU implementation delivered exceptional performance in portability, high throughput, and GPU utilization, positioning BIT1 for exascale supercomputing and advancing fusion energy research.

Rel is a new relational language whose key design goal is to go beyond this paradigm with features that allow for programming in the large, making it possible to fully describe end to end application semantics. With the new approach we can model the semantics of entire enterprise applications relationally, which helps significantly reduce architecture complexity and avoid the well-known impedance mismatch problem. This paradigm shift is enabled by 50 years of database research, making it possible to revisit the sublanguage/host language paradigm, starting from the fundamental principles. We present the main features of Rel: those that give it the power to express traditional query language operations and those that are designed to grow the language and allow programming in the large.</p></details> |  |
| **[TileLang: A Composable Tiled Programming Model for AI Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17577v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern AI workloads rely heavily on optimized computing kernels for both training and inference. These AI kernels follow well-defined data-flow patterns, such as moving tiles between DRAM and SRAM and performing a sequence of computations on those tiles. However, writing high-performance kernels remains complex despite the clarity of these patterns. Achieving peak performance requires careful, hardware-centric optimizations to fully leverage modern accelerators. While domain-specific compilers attempt to reduce the burden of writing high-performance kernels, they often struggle with usability and expressiveness gaps. In this paper, we present TileLang, a generalized tiled programming model for more efficient AI Kernel programming. TileLang decouples scheduling space (thread binding, layout, tensorize and pipeline) from dataflow, and encapsulated them as a set of customization annotations and primitives. This approach allows users to focus on the kernel's data-flow itself, while leaving most other optimizations to compilers. We conduct comprehensive experiments on commonly-used devices, across numerous experiments, our evaluation shows that TileLang can achieve state-of-the-art performance in key kernels, demonstrating that its unified block-and-thread paradigm and transparent scheduling capabilities deliver both the power and flexibility demanded by modern AI system development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Catalytic Computing and Register Programs Beyond Log-Depth](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17412v1)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In a seminal work, Buhrman et al. (STOC 2014) defined the class $CSPACE(s,c)$ of problems solvable in space $s$ with an additional catalytic tape of size $c$, which is a tape whose initial content must be restored at the end of the computation. They showed that uniform $TC^1$ circuits are computable in catalytic logspace, i.e., $CL=CSPACE(O(\log{n}), 2^{O(\log{n})})$, thus giving strong evidence that catalytic space gives $L$ strict additional power. Their study focuses on an arithmetic model called register programs, which has been a focal point in development since then. Understanding $CL$ remains a major open problem, as $TC^1$ remains the most powerful containment to date. In this work, we study the power of catalytic space and register programs to compute circuits of larger depth. Using register programs, we show that for every $\epsilon > 0$, $SAC^2 \subseteq CSPACE\left(O\left(\frac{\log^2{n}}{\log\log{n}}\right), 2^{O(\log^{1+\epsilon} n)}\right)$ This is an $O(\log \log n)$ factor improvement on the free space needed to compute $SAC^2$, which can be accomplished with near-polynomial catalytic space. We also exhibit non-trivial register programs for matrix powering, which is a further step towards showing $NC^2 \subseteq CL$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking Programmed I/O for Fast Devices, Cheap Cores, and Coherent Interconnects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.08141v3)** | 2025-04-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional wisdom holds that an efficient interface between an OS running on a CPU and a high-bandwidth I/O device should use Direct Memory Access (DMA) to offload data transfer, descriptor rings for buffering and queuing, and interrupts for asynchrony between cores and device. In this paper we question this wisdom in the light of two trends: modern and emerging cache-coherent interconnects like CXL3.0, and workloads, particularly microservices and serverless computing. Like some others before us, we argue that the assumptions of the DMA-based model are obsolete, and in many use-cases programmed I/O, where the CPU explicitly transfers data and control information to and from a device via loads and stores, delivers a more efficient system. However, we push this idea much further. We show, in a real hardware implementation, the gains in latency for fine-grained communication achievable using an open cache-coherence protocol which exposes cache transitions to a smart device, and that throughput is competitive with DMA over modern interconnects. We also demonstrate three use-cases: fine-grained RPC-style invocation of functions on an accelerator, offloading of operators in a streaming dataflow engine, and a network interface targeting serverless functions, comparing our use of coherence with both traditional DMA-style interaction and a highly-optimized implementation using memory-mapped programmed I/O over PCIe.</p></details> |  |
| **[EduBot -- Can LLMs Solve Personalized Learning and Programming Assignments?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17824v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The prevalence of Large Language Models (LLMs) is revolutionizing the process of writing code. General and code LLMs have shown impressive performance in generating standalone functions and code-completion tasks with one-shot queries. However, the ability to solve comprehensive programming tasks with recursive requests and bug fixes remains questionable. In this paper, we propose EduBot, an intelligent automated assistant system that combines conceptual knowledge teaching, end-to-end code development, personalized programming through recursive prompt-driven methods, and debugging with limited human interventions powered by LLMs. We show that EduBot can solve complicated programming tasks consisting of sub-tasks with increasing difficulties ranging from conceptual to coding questions by recursive automatic prompt-driven systems without finetuning on LLMs themselves. To further evaluate EduBot's performance, we design and conduct a benchmark suite consisting of 20 scenarios in algorithms, machine learning, and real-world problems. The result shows that EduBot can complete most scenarios in less than 20 minutes. Based on the benchmark suites, we perform a comparative study to take different LLMs as the backbone and to verify EduBot's compatibility and robustness across LLMs with varying capabilities. We believe that EduBot is an exploratory approach to explore the potential of pre-trained LLMs in multi-step reasoning and code generation for solving personalized assignments with knowledge learning and code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at AAAI 2025 AI4EDU Workshop</p></details> |
| **[Efficient, Portable, Census-Polymorphic Choreographic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02107v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Choreographic programming (CP) is a paradigm for implementing distributed systems that uses a single global program to define the actions and interactions of all participants. Library-level CP implementations, like HasChor, integrate well with mainstream programming languages but have several limitations: Their conditionals require extra communication; they require specific host-language features (e.g., monads); and they lack support for programming patterns that are essential for implementing realistic distributed applications. We make three contributions to library-level CP to specifically address these challenges. First, we propose and formalize conclaves and multiply-located values, which enable efficient conditionals in library-level CP without redundant communication. Second, we propose end-point projection as dependency injection, a design pattern that enables library-level CP in host languages without support for monads. Third, we propose census polymorphism, a technique for abstracting over the number of participants in a choreography. We demonstrate these contributions via implementations in Haskell, Rust, and TypeScript.</p></details> | Presenting at PLDI25 |
| **[LLM impact on BLV programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17018v1)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly becoming integral to a wide range of tools, tasks, and problem-solving processes, especially in software development. Originally designed for natural language processing tasks such as text generation, LLMs are increasingly being used to assist both professionals and students in writing code. This growing reliance on LLM-based tools is reshaping programming workflows and task execution. In this study, we explore the impact of these technologies on blind and low-vision (BLV) developers. Our review of existing literature indicates that while LLMs help mitigate some of the challenges faced by BLV programmers, they also introduce new forms of inaccessibility. We conducted an evaluation of five popular LLM-powered integrated development environments (IDEs), assessing their performance across a comprehensive set of programming tasks. Our findings highlight several unsupported scenarios, instances of incorrect model output, and notable limitations in interaction support for specific tasks. Through observing BLV developers as they engaged in coding activities, we uncovered key interaction barriers that go beyond model accuracy or code generation quality. This paper outlines the challenges and corresponding opportunities for improving accessibility in the context of generative AI-assisted programming. Addressing these issues can meaningfully enhance the programming experience for BLV developers. As the generative AI revolution continues to unfold, it must also address the unique burdens faced by this community.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ASSETS 2025</p></details> |

Anyone who ignores that it is humans who use these tools risks building tools that are useless, or worse, harmful. To ensure our data engineering tools are based on solid foundations, we performed a systematic review of common programming mistakes in data engineering. We focus on programming beginners (students) by analyzing both the limited literature specific to data engineering mistakes and general programming mistakes in languages commonly used in data engineering (Python, SQL, Java). Through analysis of 21 publications spanning from 2003 to 2024, we synthesized these complementary sources into a comprehensive classification that captures both general programming challenges and domain-specific data engineering mistakes. This classification provides an empirical foundation for future tool development and educational strategies. We believe our systematic categorization will help researchers, practitioners, and educators better understand and address the challenges faced by novice data engineers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 2025 IEEE/ACM 37th International Conference on Software Engineering Education and Training (CSEE&T)</p></details> |
| **[Program Evaluation with Remotely Sensed Outcomes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10959v2)** | 2025-04-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Economists often estimate treatment effects in experiments using remotely sensed variables (RSVs), e.g. satellite images or mobile phone activity, in place of directly measured economic outcomes. A common practice is to use an observational sample to train a predictor of the economic outcome from the RSV, and then to use its predictions as the outcomes in the experiment. We show that this method is biased whenever the RSV is post-outcome, i.e. if variation in the economic outcome causes variation in the RSV. In program evaluation, changes in poverty or environmental quality cause changes in satellite images, but not vice versa. As our main result, we nonparametrically identify the treatment effect by formalizing the intuition that underlies common practice: the conditional distribution of the RSV given the outcome and treatment is stable across the samples.Based on our identifying formula, we find that the efficient representation of RSVs for causal inference requires three predictions rather than one. Valid inference does not require any rate conditions on RSV predictions, justifying the use of complex deep learning algorithms with unknown statistical properties. We re-analyze the effect of an anti-poverty program in India using satellite images.</p></details> |  |
| **[GENCNIPPET: Automated Generation of Code Snippets for Supporting Programming Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16292v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Software developers often ask questions on Technical Q&A forums like Stack Overflow (SO) to seek solutions to their programming-related problems (e.g., errors and unexpected behavior of code). Problem: Many questions miss required code snippets due to the lack of readily available code, time constraints, employer restrictions, confidentiality concerns, or uncertainty about what code to share. Unfortunately, missing but required code snippets prevent questions from getting prompt and appropriate solutions. Objective: We plan to introduce GENCNIPPET, a tool designed to integrate with SO's question submission system. GENCNIPPET will generate relevant code examples (when required) to support questions for their timely solutions. Methodology: We first downloaded the SO April 2024 data dump, which contains 1.94 million questions related to Python that have code snippets and 1.43 million questions related to Java. Then, we filter these questions to identify those that genuinely require code snippets using a state-of-the-art machine learning model. Next, we select questions with positive scores to ensure high-quality data. Our plan is to fine-tune Llama-3 models (e.g., Llama-3-8B), using 80% of the selected questions for training and 10% for validation. The primary reasons for choosing Llama models are their open-source accessibility and robust fine-tuning capabilities, which are essential for deploying a freely accessible tool. GENCNIPPET will be integrated with the SO question submission system as a browser plugin. It will communicate with the fine-tuned model to generate code snippets tailored to the target questions. The effectiveness of the generated code examples will be assessed using automatic evaluation against ground truth, user perspectives, and live (wild) testing in real-world scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in the International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR 2025 Registered Reports Track)</p></details> |
| **[Hexcute: A Tile-based Programming Language with Automatic Layout and Task-Mapping Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16214v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep learning (DL) workloads mainly run on accelerators like GPUs. Recent DL quantization techniques demand a new matrix multiplication operator with mixed input data types, further complicating GPU optimization. Prior high-level compilers like Triton lack the expressiveness to implement key optimizations like fine-grained data pipelines and hardware-friendly memory layouts for these operators, while low-level programming models, such as Hidet, Graphene, and CUTLASS, require significant programming efforts. To balance expressiveness with engineering effort, we propose Hexcute, a tile-based programming language that exposes shared memory and register abstractions to enable fine-grained optimization for these operators. Additionally, Hexcute leverages task mapping to schedule the GPU program, and to reduce programming efforts, it automates layout and task mapping synthesis with a novel type-inference-based algorithm. Our evaluation shows that Hexcute generalizes to a wide range of DL operators, achieves 1.7-11.28$\times$ speedup over existing DL compilers for mixed-type operators, and brings up to 2.91$\times$ speedup in the end-to-end evaluation.</p></details> | 17 pages, 24 figures |
| **[Program Skeletons for Automated Program Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07483v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating software between programming languages is a challenging task, for which automated techniques have been elusive and hard to scale up to larger programs. A key difficulty in cross-language translation is that one has to re-express the intended behavior of the source program into idiomatic constructs of a different target language. This task needs abstracting away from the source language-specific details, while keeping the overall functionality the same. In this work, we propose a novel and systematic approach for making such translation amenable to automation based on a framework we call program skeletons. A program skeleton retains the high-level structure of the source program by abstracting away and effectively summarizing lower-level concrete code fragments, which can be mechanically translated to the target programming language. A skeleton, by design, permits many different ways of filling in the concrete implementation for fragments, which can work in conjunction with existing data-driven code synthesizers. Most importantly, skeletons can conceptually enable sound decomposition, i.e., if each individual fragment is correctly translated, taken together with the mechanically translated skeleton, the final translated program is deemed to be correct as a whole. We present a prototype system called Skel embodying the idea of skeleton-based translation from Python to JavaScript. Our results show promising scalability compared to prior works. For 9 real-world Python programs, some with more than about 1k lines of code, 95% of their code fragments can be automatically translated, while about 5% require manual effort. All the final translations are correct with respect to whole-program test suites.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by PLDI 2025 (46th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation)</p></details> |
| **[A Time Series Analysis of Malware Uploads to Programming Language Ecosystems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15695v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software ecosystems built around programming languages have greatly facilitated software development. At the same time, their security has increasingly been acknowledged as a problem. To this end, the paper examines the previously overlooked longitudinal aspects of software ecosystem security, focusing on malware uploaded to six popular programming language ecosystems. The dataset examined is based on the new Open Source Vulnerabilities (OSV) database. According to the results, records about detected malware uploads in the database have recently surpassed those addressing vulnerabilities in packages distributed in the ecosystems. In the early 2025 even up to 80% of all entries in the OSV have been about malware. Regarding time series analysis of malware frequencies and their shares to all database entries, good predictions are available already by relatively simple autoregressive models using the numbers of ecosystems, security advisories, and media and other articles as predictors. With these results and the accompanying discussion, the paper improves and advances the understanding of the thus far overlooked longitudinal aspects of ecosystems and malware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to TrustBus@ARES</p></details> |
| **[DaPPA: A Data-Parallel Programming Framework for Processing-in-Memory Architectures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.10168v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing volume of data in modern applications has led to significant computational costs in conventional processor-centric systems. Processing-in-memory (PIM) architectures alleviate these costs by moving computation closer to memory, reducing data movement overheads. UPMEM is the first commercially available PIM system, featuring thousands of in-order processors (DPUs) integrated within DRAM modules. However, a programming UPMEM-based system remains challenging due to the need for explicit data management and workload partitioning across DPUs. We introduce DaPPA (data-parallel processing-in-memory architecture), a programming framework that eases the programmability of UPMEM systems by automatically managing data movement, memory allocation, and workload distribution. The key idea behind DaPPA is to leverage a high-level data-parallel pattern-based programming interface to abstract hardware complexities away from the programmer. DaPPA comprises three main components: (i) data-parallel pattern APIs, a collection of five primary data-parallel pattern primitives that allow the programmer to express data transformations within an application; (ii) a dataflow programming interface, which allows the programmer to define how data moves across data-parallel patterns; and (iii) a dynamic template-based compilation, which leverages code skeletons and dynamic code transformations to convert data-parallel patterns implemented via the dataflow programming interface into an optimized UPMEM binary. We evaluate DaPPA using six workloads from the PrIM benchmark suite on a real UPMEM system. Compared to hand-tuned implementations, DaPPA improves end-to-end performance by 2.1x, on average, and reduces programming complexity (measured in lines-of-code) by 94%. Our results demonstrate that DaPPA is an effective programming framework for efficient and user-friendly programming on UPMEM systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Joint Optimization of Multimodal Transit Frequency and Shared Autonomous Vehicle Fleet Size with Hybrid Metaheuristic and Nonlinear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.19401v2)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Shared autonomous vehicles (SAVs) bring competition to traditional transit services but redesigning multimodal transit network can utilize SAVs as feeders to enhance service efficiency and coverage. This paper presents an optimization framework for the joint multimodal transit frequency and SAV fleet size problem, a variant of the transit network frequency setting problem. The objective is to maximize total transit ridership (including SAV-fed trips and subtracting boarding rejections) across multiple time periods under budget constraints, considering endogenous mode choice (transit, point-to-point SAVs, driving) and route selection, while allowing for strategic route removal by setting frequencies to zero. Due to the problem's non-linear, non-convex nature and the computational challenges of large-scale networks, we develop a hybrid solution approach that combines a metaheuristic approach (particle swarm optimization) with nonlinear programming for local solution refinement. To ensure computational tractability, the framework integrates analytical approximation models for SAV waiting times based on fleet utilization, multimodal network assignment for route choice, and multinomial logit mode choice behavior, bypassing the need for computationally intensive simulations within the main optimization loop. Applied to the Chicago metropolitan area's multimodal network, our method illustrates a 33.3% increase in transit ridership through optimized transit route frequencies and SAV integration, particularly enhancing off-peak service accessibility and strategically reallocating resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 5 figures, a previous version is accepted for presentation at the Conference on Advanced Systems in Public Transport and TransitData 2025 in Kyoto, Japan on 1 - 4 July 2025</p></details> |
| **[Smooth, Integrated Proofs of Cryptographic Constant Time for Nondeterministic Programs and Compilers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15550v1)** | 2025-04-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal verification of software and compilers has been used to rule out large classes of security-critical issues, but risk of unintentional information leakage has received much less consideration. It is a key requirement for formal specifications to leave some details of a system's behavior unspecified so that future implementation changes can be accommodated, and yet it is nonetheless expected that these choices would not be made based on confidential information the system handles. This paper formalizes that notion using omnisemantics and plain single-copy assertions, giving for the first time a specification of what it means for a nondeterministic program to be constant-time or more generally to avoid leaking (a part of) its inputs. We use this theory to prove data-leak-free execution of core cryptographic routines compiled from Bedrock2 C to RISC-V machine code, showing that the smooth specification and proof experience omnisemantics provides for nondeterminism extends to constant-time properties in the same setting. We also study variants of the key program-compiler contract, highlighting pitfalls of tempting simplifications and subtle consequences of how inputs to nondeterministic choices are constrained. Our results are backed by modular program-logic and compiler-correctness theorems, and they integrate into a neat end-to-end theorem in the Coq proof assistant.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 1 table, 0 figures. to be published in PLDI 2025 proceedings</p></details> |

The while-language we consider is a simple computation model that can simulate (and be simulated by) Turing Machines with a quadratic time and constant space blow-up. Our framework derives while-programs from functional programs written in a subset of Isabelle/HOL, namely tail-recursive functions with first-order arguments and algebraic datatypes. As far as we are aware, it is the first framework targeting a computation model that is reasonable in time and space from a complexity-theoretic perspective.</p></details> |  |
| **[MaCTG: Multi-Agent Collaborative Thought Graph for Automatic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19245v2)** | 2025-04-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), LLM-based approaches have demonstrated strong problem-solving capabilities across various domains. However, in automatic programming, a single LLM is typically limited to function-level code generation, while multi-agent systems composed of multiple LLMs often suffer from inefficient task planning. This lack of structured coordination can lead to cascading hallucinations, where accumulated errors across agents result in suboptimal workflows and excessive computational costs. To overcome these challenges, we introduce MaCTG (Multi-Agent Collaborative Thought Graph), a novel multi-agent framework that employs a dynamic graph structure to facilitate precise task allocation and controlled collaboration among LLM agents. MaCTG autonomously assigns agent roles based on programming requirements, dynamically refines task distribution through context-aware adjustments, and systematically verifies and integrates project-level code, effectively reducing hallucination errors and improving overall accuracy. MaCTG enhances cost-effectiveness by implementing a hybrid LLM deployment, where proprietary models handle complex reasoning, while open-source models are used for routine coding and validation tasks. To evaluate MaCTG's effectiveness, we applied it to traditional image processing auto-programming tasks, achieving a state-of-the-art accuracy of 83.33%. Additionally, by leveraging its hybrid LLM configuration, MaCTG significantly reduced operational costs by 89.09% compared to existing multi-agent frameworks, demonstrating its efficiency, scalability, and real-world applicability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Program Synthesis From Partial Traces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14480v1)** | 2025-04-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first technique to synthesize programs that compose side-effecting functions, pure functions, and control flow, from partial traces containing records of only the side-effecting functions. This technique can be applied to synthesize API composing scripts from logs of calls made to those APIs, or a script from traces of system calls made by a workload, for example. All of the provided traces are positive examples, meaning that they describe desired behavior. Our approach does not require negative examples. Instead, it generalizes over the examples and uses cost metrics to prevent over-generalization. Because the problem is too complex for traditional monolithic program synthesis techniques, we propose a new combination of optimizing rewrites and syntax-guided program synthesis. The resulting program is correct by construction, so its output will always be able to reproduce the input traces. We evaluate the quality of the programs synthesized when considering various optimization metrics and the synthesizer's efficiency on real-world benchmarks. The results show that our approach can generate useful real-world programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at PLDI 2025 (46th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation)</p></details> |
| **[Mathematical Programming Models for Exact and Interpretable Formulation of Neural Networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14356v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a unified mixed-integer programming framework for training sparse and interpretable neural networks. We develop exact formulations for both fully connected and convolutional architectures by modeling nonlinearities such as ReLU activations through binary variables and encoding structural sparsity via filter- and layer-level pruning constraints. The resulting models integrate parameter learning, architecture selection, and structural regularization within a single optimization problem, yielding globally optimal solutions with respect to a composite objective that balances prediction accuracy, weight sparsity, and architectural compactness. The mixed-integer programming formulation accommodates piecewise-linear operations, including max pooling and activation gating, and permits precise enforcement of logic-based or domain-specific constraints. By incorporating considerations of interpretability, sparsity, and verifiability directly into the training process, the proposed framework bridges a range of research areas including explainable artificial intelligence, symbolic reasoning, and formal verification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ordered Completion for Non-Locally Tight mini-gringo Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14252v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Completion is a well-known transformation that captures the stable model semantics of logic programs by turning a program into a set of first-order definitions. Stable models are models of the completion, but not all models of the completion are stable models. For tight programs (programs without positive recursion) the two semantics coincide. Recently this correspondence was extended to locally tight programs, which avoid non-terminating recursion. However, unlike tightness, local tightness cannot be checked with simple syntactic methods. Completion is crucial for verifying answer set programs, especially for external equivalence: a form of equivalence based on selected output predicates under certain inputs. Standard equivalence and adherence to a first-order specification are special cases of external equivalence. The anthem verification tool has two limitations for checking external equivalence: (1) there is no way to check local tightness automatically, and (2) it is not possible to verify programs that are not locally tight. Therefore, alternatives to completion are of interest. This thesis investigates ordered completion, introduced in [Asuncion et al., 2012], which captures stable models of arbitrary logic programs, but only for finite models. This work extends ordered completion to the mini-gringo language (a subset of the language used by the clingo solver). Additionally, it introduces a modification of ordered completion to handle infinite stable models. This extended ordered completion is implemented in anthem as a translation, and initial experiments demonstrate its use for verifying simple logic programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Maste...</summary><p>Master's Thesis submitted at the University of Potsdam</p></details> |

Foundational tasks here involve selecting markets, plants, warehouses, and distribution centers to maximize profits while considering related constraints. Based on a variation of the quadratic assignment problem, we propose a novel integer programming formula that significantly reduces the variables. Our model incorporates several realistic features, including transportation costs and upper bounds on facilities at each level. It accounts for one-time fixed costs associated with selecting each facility. To solve this complex problem, we develop and experimentally test two solution procedures: a multi-start greedy heuristic and a multi-start tabu search. We conduct extensive sensitivity analyses on the results to assess the reliability of proposed algorithms. This study contributes to improved solution methods for large-scale 4L-FLPs, providing a valuable tool for supply chain maturity.</p></details> | 38 pages |
| **[Refinement orders for quantum programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14158v1)** | 2025-04-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Refinement is an influential technique used in the verification and development of computer programs. It provides a systematic and rigorous approach to software development through stepwise refinement, where a high-level abstract specification is progressively transformed into an implementation that meets the desired requirements. Central to this technique is the notion of a refinement order, which ensures that each refinement step preserves program correctness. Different orders can be defined with respect to partial and total correctness, as well as for deterministic and nondeterministic programs. In the realm of quantum programs, the theory becomes even more intricate due to the existence of various quantum state predicates, leading to different notions of specifications. This paper thoroughly explores different refinement orders for quantum programs and examines the relationships between them.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging the strengths of both optimization techniques and machine learning, this method introduces a robust framework for solving complex optimization problems where traditional methods may fall short. The proposed approach encapsulates the constraints and objectives of a linear programming problem directly into the loss function, guiding the learning process to adhere to these constraints while optimizing the desired outcomes. This technique not only preserves the interpretability of linear programming but also benefits from the flexibility and adaptability of machine learning, making it particularly well-suited for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |

One potential application of these models in the educational field would be to provide feedback to students in university introductory programming courses, so that a student struggling to solve a basic implementation problem could seek help from an LLM available 24/7. This article focuses on studying three aspects related to such an application. First, the performance of two well-known models, GPT-3.5T and GPT-4T, in providing feedback to students is evaluated. The empirical results showed that GPT-4T performs much better than GPT-3.5T, however, it is not yet ready for use in a real-world scenario. This is due to the possibility of generating incorrect information that potential users may not always be able to detect. Second, the article proposes a carefully designed prompt using in-context learning techniques that allows automating important parts of the evaluation process, as well as providing a lower bound for the fraction of feedbacks containing incorrect information, saving time and effort. This was possible because the resulting feedback has a programmatically analyzable structure that incorporates diagnostic information about the LLM's performance in solving the requested task. Third, the article also suggests a possible strategy for implementing a practical learning tool based on LLMs, which is rooted on the proposed prompting techniques. This strategy opens up a whole range of interesting possibilities from a pedagogical perspective.</p></details> |  |

In distributed learning, manual parallelism (MP) methods demand considerable human effort and have limited flexibility. Hence, automatic parallelism (AP) methods have recently been proposed for automating the parallel strategy optimization process. Existing AP methods suffer from sub-optimal solutions because they do not jointly optimize the two categories of parallel strategies (i.e., inter-layer parallelism and intra-layer parallelism). In this paper, we propose a novel AP method called UniAP, which unifies inter- and intra-layer automatic parallelism by mixed integer quadratic programming. To the best of our knowledge, UniAP is the first parallel method that can jointly optimize the two categories of parallel strategies to find an optimal solution. Experimental results show that UniAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 3.80$\times$ in throughput and reduces strategy optimization time by up to 107$\times$ across five Transformer-based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures, CVPR 2025</p></details> |

An NL outline for a code function comprises multiple statements written in concise prose, which partition the code and summarize its main ideas in the style of literate programming. Crucially, we find that modern LLMs can generate accurate and high-quality NL outlines in practice. Moreover, NL outlines enable a bidirectional sync between code and NL, where a developer can change either code or NL and have the LLM automatically update the other. We discuss many use cases for NL outlines: they can accelerate understanding and navigation of code and diffs, simplify code maintenance, augment code search, steer code generation, and more. We then propose and compare multiple LLM prompting techniques for generating outlines and ask professional developers to judge outline quality. Finally, we present two case studies applying NL outlines toward code review and malware detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to FSE'25 Industry Track</p></details> |
| **[Unlocking LLM Repair Capabilities in Low-Resource Programming Languages Through Cross-Language Translation and Multi-Agent Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22512v3)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in leveraging LLMs for APR have demonstrated impressive capabilities in fixing software defects. However, current LLM-based approaches predominantly focus on mainstream programming languages like Java and Python, neglecting less prevalent but emerging languages such as Rust due to expensive training resources, limited datasets, and insufficient community support. This narrow focus creates a significant gap in repair capabilities across the programming language spectrum, where the full potential of LLMs for comprehensive multilingual program repair remains largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel cross-language program repair approach LANTERN that leverages LLMs' differential proficiency across languages through a multi-agent iterative repair paradigm. Our technique strategically translates defective code from languages where LLMs exhibit weaker repair capabilities to languages where they demonstrate stronger performance, without requiring additional training. A key innovation of our approach is an LLM-based decision-making system that dynamically selects optimal target languages based on bug characteristics and continuously incorporates feedback from previous repair attempts. We evaluate our method on xCodeEval, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 5,068 bugs across 11 programming languages. Results demonstrate significant enhancement in repair effectiveness, particularly for underrepresented languages, with Rust showing a 22.09% improvement in Pass@10 metrics. Our research provides the first empirical evidence that cross-language translation significantly expands the repair capabilities of LLMs and effectively bridges the performance gap between programming languages with different levels of popularity, opening new avenues for truly language-agnostic automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Productivity in Quantum Programming Equivalent to Expressiveness?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08876v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The expressiveness of quantum programming languages plays a crucial role in the efficient and comprehensible representation of quantum algorithms. Unlike classical programming languages, which offer mature and well-defined abstraction mechanisms, quantum languages must integrate cognitively challenging concepts such as superposition, interference and entanglement while maintaining clarity and usability. However, identifying and characterizing differences in expressiveness between quantum programming paradigms remains an open area of study. Our work investigates the landscape of expressiveness through a comparative analysis of hosted quantum programming languages such as Qiskit, Cirq, Qrisp, and quAPL, and standalone languages including Q# and Qmod. We focused on evaluating how different quantum programming languages support the implementation of core quantum algorithms -- Deutsch-Jozsa, Simon, Bernstein-Vazirani, and Grover -- using expressiveness metrics: Lines of Code (LOC), Cyclomatic Complexity (CC), and Halstead Complexity (HC) metrics as proxies for developer productivity. Our findings suggest that different quantum programming paradigms offer distinct trade-offs between expressiveness and productivity, highlighting the importance of language design in quantum software development.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

In the first study of its kind, we analyze fixation-related potentials (FRPs) to explore the online processing of program code patterns that are ambiguous to programmers, but not the computer (so-called atoms of confusion), and their underlying neurocognitive mechanisms in an ecologically valid setting. Relative to unambiguous counterparts in program code, atoms of confusion elicit a late frontal positivity with a duration of about 400 to 700 ms after first looking at the atom of confusion. As the frontal positivity shows high resemblance with an event-related potential (ERP) component found during natural language processing that is elicited by unexpected but plausible words in sentence context, we take these data to suggest that the brain engages similar neurocognitive mechanisms in response to unexpected and informative inputs in program code and in natural language. In both domains, these inputs lead to an update of a comprehender's situation model that is essential for information extraction from a quickly unfolding input.</p></details> |  |

However, crosstalk from concurrent two-qubit CNOT gates poses security risks, compromising the fidelity and output of co-running victim programs. We design Zero Knowledge Tampering Attacks (ZKTAs), using which attackers can exploit crosstalk without knowledge of the hardware error profile. ZKTAs can alter victim program outputs in 40% of cases on commercial systems. We identify that ZKTAs succeed because the attacker's program consistently runs with the same victim program in a fixed context. To mitigate this, we propose QONTEXTS: a context-switching technique that defends against ZKTAs by running programs across multiple contexts, each handling only a subset of trials. QONTEXTS uses multi-programming with frequent context switching while identifying a unique set of programs for each context. This helps limit only a fraction of execution to ZKTAs. We enhance QONTEXTS with attack detection capabilities that compare the distributions from different contexts against each other to identify noisy contexts executed with ZKTAs. Our evaluations on real IBMQ systems show that QONTEXTS increases program resilience by three orders of magnitude and fidelity by 1.33$\times$ on average. Moreover, QONTEXTS improves throughput by 2$\times$, advancing security in multi-programmed environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Hitchhiker's Guide to Program Analysis, Part II: Deep Thoughts by LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11711v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static analysis is a cornerstone for software vulnerability detection, yet it often struggles with the classic precision-scalability trade-off. In practice, such tools often produce high false positive rates, particularly in large codebases like the Linux kernel. This imprecision can arise from simplified vulnerability modeling and over-approximation of path and data constraints. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in code understanding, their naive application to program analysis yields unreliable results due to inherent reasoning limitations. We introduce BugLens, a post-refinement framework that significantly improves static analysis precision. BugLens guides an LLM to follow traditional analysis steps by assessing buggy code patterns for security impact and validating the constraints associated with static warnings. Evaluated on real-world Linux kernel bugs, BugLens raises precision from 0.10 (raw) and 0.50 (semi-automated refinement) to 0.72, substantially reducing false positives and revealing four previously unreported vulnerabilities. Our results suggest that a structured LLM-based workflow can meaningfully enhance the effectiveness of static analysis tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[RePurr: Automated Repair of Block-Based Learners' Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12445v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Programming is increasingly taught using block-based languages like Scratch. While the use of blocks prevents syntax errors, learners can still make semantic mistakes, requiring feedback and help. As teachers may be overwhelmed by help requests in a classroom, may lack programming expertise themselves, or may be unavailable in independent learning scenarios, automated hint generation is desirable. Automated program repair (APR) can provide the foundation for this, but relies on multiple assumptions: (1) APR usually targets isolated bugs, but learners may fundamentally misunderstand tasks or request help for substantially incomplete code. (2) Software tests are required to guide the search and localize broken blocks, but tests for block-based programs are different to those in past APR research: They consist of system tests, and very few of them already fully cover the code. At the same time, they have vastly longer runtimes due to animations and interactions on Scratch programs, which inhibits the applicability of search. (3) The plastic surgery hypothesis assumes the code necessary for repairs already exists in the codebase. Block-based programs tend to be small and may lack this redundancy. To study if APR of such programs is still feasible, we introduce, to the best of our knowledge, the first APR approach for Scratch based on evolutionary search. Our RePurr prototype includes novel refinements of fault localization to improve the guidance of test suites, recovers the plastic surgery hypothesis by exploiting that learning scenarios provide model and student solutions, and reduces the costs of fitness evaluations via test parallelization and acceleration. Empirical evaluation on a set of real learners' programs confirms the anticipated challenges, but also demonstrates APR can still effectively improve and fix learners' programs, enabling automated generation of hints and feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Generating Pragmatic Examples to Train Neural Program Synthesizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05740v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Programming-by-example is the task of synthesizing a program that is consistent with a set of user-provided input-output examples. As examples are often an under-specification of one's intent, a good synthesizer must choose the intended program from the many that are consistent with the given set of examples. Prior work frames program synthesis as a cooperative game between a listener (that synthesizes programs) and a speaker (a user choosing examples), and shows that models of computational pragmatic inference are effective in choosing the user intended programs. However, these models require counterfactual reasoning over a large set of programs and examples, which is infeasible in realistic program spaces. In this paper, we propose PraX, a novel way to amortize this search with neural networks. We sample pairs of programs and examples via self-play between listener and speaker models, and use pragmatic inference to choose informative training examples from this sample. We then use the informative dataset to train models to improve the synthesizer's ability to disambiguate user-provided examples without human supervision. We validate PraX on the challenging task of synthesizing regular expressions from example strings, and find that our method (1) outperforms models trained without choosing pragmatic examples by 23% (a 51% relative increase) (2) matches the performance of supervised learning on a dataset of pragmatic examples provided by humans, despite using no human data in training.</p></details> | ICLR 2024 |

We previously introduced EdgeWise, a hybrid approach that combines declarative programming with Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to determine optimal placements that minimise operational costs and unnecessary data transfers. The declarative stage pre-processes infrastructure constraints to improve the efficiency of the MILP solver, achieving optimal placements in terms of operational costs, with significantly reduced execution times. In this extended version, we improve the declarative stage with continuous reasoning, presenting EdgeWiseCR, which enables the system to reuse existing placements and reduce unnecessary recomputation and service migrations. In addition, we conducted an expanded experimental evaluation considering multiple applications, diverse network topologies, and large-scale infrastructures with dynamic failures. The results show that EdgeWiseCR achieves up to 65% faster execution compared to EdgeWise, while preserving placement stability under dynamic conditions.</p></details> |  |

Early engagement is vital for building interest in computing careers and achieving equitable participation. Recent work has shown that the use of sensor-enabled tools and block-based programming can improve engagement and self-efficacy for students from under-represented groups, but these findings lack replication in diverse, resource-constrained settings. This study addresses this gap by implementing sensor-based programming workshops with rural students in Sri Lanka. Replicating methods from the literature, we conduct a between-group study (sensor vs. non-sensor) using Scratch and real-time environmental sensors. We found that students in both groups reported significantly higher confidence in programming in Scratch after the workshop. In addition, average changes in both self-efficacy and outcome expectancy were higher in the experimental (sensor) group than in the control (non-sensor) group, mirroring trends observed in the original study being replicated. We also found that using the sensors helped to enhance creativity and inspired some students to express an interest in information and communications technology (ICT) careers, supporting the value of such hands-on activities in building programming confidence among under-represented groups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ITiCSE 2025</p></details> |

This opportunistic behavior hinders the effective generation of programs that trigger bugs in compilers and analyzers, even when such programs closely resemble those generated. To address this limitation, we propose bounded exhaustive random program generation, a novel method that focuses the search space of program generation with the aim of more quickly identifying bug-triggering programs. Our approach comprises two stages: 1) generating random program templates, which are incomplete test programs containing bug-related placeholders, and 2) conducting a bounded exhaustive enumeration of valid values for each placeholder within these templates. To ensure efficiency, we maintain a solvable constraint set during the template generation phase and then methodically explore all possible values of placeholders within these constraints during the exhaustive enumeration phase. We have implemented this approach for Solidity, a popular smart contract language for the Ethereum blockchain, in a tool named Erwin. Based on a recent study of Solidity compiler bugs, the placeholders used by Erwin relate to language features commonly associated with compiler bugs. Erwin has successfully identified 23 previously unknown bugs across two Solidity compilers, solc and solang, and one Solidity static analyzer, slither. Evaluation results demonstrate that Erwin outperforms state-of-the-art Solidity fuzzers in bug detection and complements developer-written test suites by covering 4,582 edges and 14,737 lines of the solc compiler that were missed by solc unit tests.</p></details> |  |

This limits opportunities for students to practice how to clarify ambiguous requirements -- a critical skill in real-world programming. In addition, the emerging capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to produce code from well-defined specifications may harm student engagement with traditional programming exercises. This study explores the use of ``Probeable Problems'', automatically gradable tasks that have deliberately vague or incomplete specifications. Such problems require students to submit test inputs, or `probes', to clarify requirements before implementation. Through analysis of over 40,000 probes in an introductory course, we identify patterns linking probing behaviors to task success. Systematic strategies, such as thoroughly exploring expected behavior before coding, resulted in fewer incorrect code submissions and correlated with course success. Feedback from nearly 1,000 participants highlighted the challenges and real-world relevance of these tasks, as well as benefits to critical thinking and metacognitive skills. Probeable Problems are easy to set up and deploy at scale, and help students recognize and resolve uncertainties in programming problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ITiCSE 2025</p></details> |

Despite the extensive research on identifying and quantifying TD, there remains a significant gap in understanding the diversity of TD topics and their temporal development. To address this, we have conducted an explorative analysis of TD data extracted from GitHub issues spanning from 2015 to September 2023. We employed BERTopic for sophisticated topic modelling. This study categorises the TD topics and tracks their progression over time. Furthermore, we have incorporated sentiment analysis for each identified topic, providing a deeper insight into the perceptions and attitudes associated with these topics. This offers a more nuanced understanding of the trends and shifts in TD topics through time, programming language, and repository.</p></details> |  |

A central challenge lies in fast fitness evaluations on large training datasets, especially for complex real-world problems involving time-consuming simulations. Surrogate models, like phenotypic characterization (PC)-based K-nearest neighbors (KNN), have been applied to reduce computational cost. However, the PC-based similarity measure is confined to behavioral characteristics, overlooking genotypic differences, which can limit surrogate quality and impair performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes a pheno-geno unified surrogate GP algorithm, PGU-SGP, integrating phenotypic and genotypic characterization (GC) to enhance surrogate sample selection and fitness prediction. A novel unified similarity metric combining PC and GC distances is proposed, along with an effective and efficient GC representation. Experimental results of a real-life vehicle scheduling problem demonstrate that PGU-SGP reduces training time by approximately 76% while achieving comparable performance to traditional GP. With the same training time, PGU-SGP significantly outperforms traditional GP and the state-of-the-art algorithm on most datasets. Additionally, PGU-SGP shows faster convergence and improved surrogate quality by maintaining accurate fitness rankings and appropriate selection pressure, further validating its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, 8 tables.

The fitness evaluation in genetic programming suffers from high computational requirements, limiting the performance on difficult problems. Consequently, there is no efficient genetic programming framework that is usable for a wide range of tasks. To this end, we developed Kozax, a genetic programming framework that evolves symbolic expressions for arbitrary problems. We implemented Kozax using JAX, a framework for high-performance and scalable machine learning, which allows the fitness evaluation to scale efficiently to large populations or datasets on GPU. Furthermore, Kozax offers constant optimization, custom operator definition and simultaneous evolution of multiple trees. We demonstrate successful applications of Kozax to discover equations of natural laws, recover equations of hidden dynamic variables, evolve a control policy and optimize an objective function. Overall, Kozax provides a general, fast, and scalable library to optimize white-box solutions in the realm of scientific computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 fig...</summary><p>6 figures, 3 tables, 1 algorithm, 13 pages</p></details> |

The DS obtained, which reveals closely related entities, has been found to be useful in various application domains such as e-commerce, social science, and biology. However, in a big graph that contains billions of edges, it is desirable to find more than one subgraph cluster that is not necessarily the densest, yet they reveal closely related vertices. In this paper, we study the locally densest subgraph (LDS), a recently proposed variant of DS. An LDS is a subgraph which is the densest among the ``local neighbors''. Given a graph $G$, a number of LDSs can be returned, which reflect different dense regions of $G$ and thus give more information than DS. The existing LDS solution suffers from low efficiency. We thus develop a convex-programming-based solution that enables powerful pruning. We also extend our algorithm to triangle-based density to solve LTDS problem. Based on current algorithms, we propose a unified framework for the LDS and LTDS problems. Extensive experiments on thirteen real large graph datasets show that our proposed algorithm is up to four orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

We propose an infinite class of product programs, specifically designed with recursion in mind, that reduce the hypersafety verification of a recursive program to standard safety verification. For this, we combine insights from language theory and concurrency theory to propose an algorithmic solution for constructing an infinite class of recursive product programs. One key insight is that, using the simple theory of visibly pushdown languages, one can maintain the recursive structure of syntactic program alignments which is vital to constructing a new product program that can be viewed as a classic recursive program -- that is, one that can be executed on a single stack. Another key insight is that techniques from concurrency theory can be generalized to help define product programs based on the view that the parallel composition of individual recursive programs includes all possible alignments from which a sound set of alignments that faithfully preserve the satisfaction of the hypersafety property can be selected. On the practical side, we formulate a family of parametric canonical product constructions that are intuitive to programmers and can be used as building blocks to specify recursive product programs for the purpose of relational and hypersafety verification, with the idea that the right product program can be verified automatically using existing techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques through an implementation and highly promising experimental results.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages of main text (7 figures) and 13 pages of appendix</p></details> |

One such principle is quantum no-cloning which has led to the emerging field of revocable cryptography. Roughly speaking, in a revocable cryptographic primitive, a cryptographic object (such as a ciphertext or program) is represented as a quantum state in such a way that surrendering it effectively translates into losing the capability to use this cryptographic object. All of the revocable cryptographic systems studied so far have a major drawback: the recipient only receives one copy of the quantum state. Worse yet, the schemes become completely insecure if the recipient receives many identical copies of the same quantum state -- a property that is clearly much more desirable in practice. While multi-copy security has been extensively studied for a number of other quantum cryptographic primitives, it has so far received only little treatment in context of unclonable primitives. Our work, for the first time, shows the feasibility of revocable primitives, such as revocable encryption and revocable programs, which satisfy multi-copy security in oracle models. This suggest that the stronger notion of multi-copy security is within reach in unclonable cryptography more generally, and therefore could lead to a new research direction in the field.</p></details> | 42 pages |

This work presents a computational methodology for searching for pathways in reaction networks which is based on integer linear programming and the modeling of reaction networks by directed hypergraphs. Often multiple pathways fit the given search criteria. To rank them, we develop an objective function based on physical arguments maximizing the probability of the pathway. We furthermore develop an automated pipeline to estimate the energy barriers of individual reactions in reaction networks. Combined, the methodology facilitates flexible and kinetically informed pathway investigations on large reaction networks by computational means, even for networks coming without kinetic annotation, such as those created via generative approaches for expanding molecular spaces.</p></details> |  |

Latency, bandwidth constraints, and the heterogeneity of edge environments hinder the efficiency of centralized cloud solutions. While major cloud providers extend their platforms to the edge, these approaches often overlook its unique characteristics, limiting its potential. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Radon, a flexible programming model and platform designed for the edge-to-cloud continuum. Radon applications are structured as atoms, isolated stateful entities that communicate through messaging and can be composed into complex systems. The Radon runtime, based on WebAssembly (WASM), enables language- and deployment-independent execution, ensuring portability and adaptability across heterogeneous environments. This decoupling allows developers to focus on application logic while the runtime optimizes for diverse infrastructure conditions. We present a prototype implementation of Radon and evaluate its effectiveness through a distributed key-value store case study. We analyze the implementation in terms of code complexity and performance. Our results demonstrate that Radon facilitates the development and operation of scalable applications across the edge-to-cloud continuum advancing the current state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to EDCCS 2025</p></details> |

During the program optimisation process, it would be desirable to have a tool which can automatically verify whether an optimised subprogram can replace the original subprogram. Formally this corresponds to the problem of verifying the strong equivalence of two programs. In order to do so, the translation tool anthem was developed. It can be used in conjunction with an automated theorem prover for classical logic to verify that two programs are strongly equivalent. With the current version of anthem, only the strong equivalence of positive programs with a restricted input language can be verified. This is a result of the translation $\tau^*$ implemented in anthem that produces formulas in the logic of here-and-there, which coincides with classical logic only for positive programs. This thesis extends anthem in order to overcome these limitations. First, the transformation $\sigma^*$ is presented, which transforms formulas from the logic of here-and-there to classical logic. A theorem formalises how $\sigma^*$ can be used to express equivalence in the logic of here-and-there in classical logic. Second, the translation $\tau^*$ is extended to programs containing pools. Another theorem shows how $\sigma^*$ can be combined with $\tau^*$ to express the strong equivalence of two programs in classical logic. With $\sigma^*$ and the extended $\tau^*$, it is possible to express the strong equivalence of logic programs containing negation, simple choices, and pools. Both the extended $\tau^*$ and $\sigma^*$ are implemented in a new version of anthem. Several examples of logic programs containing pools, negation, and simple choice rules, which the new version of anthem can translate to classical logic, are presented.

For example, programs encoding the formal rules and properties of a system have been useful in fields ranging from RL (procedural environments) to physics (simulation engines). These programs can be seen as functions which execute to different outputs based on their parameterizations (e.g., gridworld configuration or initial physical conditions). We introduce the term EFA (Executable Functional Abstraction) to denote such programs for math problems. EFA-like constructs have been shown to be useful for math reasoning as problem generators for stress-testing models. However, prior work has been limited to abstractions for grade-school math (whose simple rules are easy to encode in programs), while generating EFAs for advanced math has thus far required human engineering. We explore the automatic construction of EFAs for advanced math problems. We operationalize the task of automatically constructing EFAs as a program synthesis task, and develop EFAGen, which conditions an LLM on a seed math problem and its step-by-step solution to generate candidate EFA programs that are faithful to the generalized problem and solution class underlying the seed problem. Furthermore, we formalize properties any valid EFA must possess in terms of executable unit tests, and show how the tests can be used as verifiable rewards to train LLMs to become better writers of EFAs. We demonstrate that EFAs constructed by EFAGen behave rationally by remaining faithful to seed problems, produce learnable problem variations, and that EFAGen can infer EFAs across multiple diverse sources of competition-level math problems. Finally, we show downstream uses of model-written EFAs e.g. finding problem variations that are harder or easier for a learner to solve, as well as data generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zaidkhan.me/EFAGen/</p></details> |

However, these problems are often autograded on the correctness of the final submission through test cases, and students cannot get feedback on their planning process. Large language models (LLM) may be able to generate this feedback by detecting the overall code structure even for submissions with syntax errors. To this end, we propose an approach that detects which high-level goals and patterns (i.e. programming plans) exist in a student program with LLMs. We show that both the full GPT-4o model and a small variant (GPT-4o-mini) can detect these plans with remarkable accuracy, outperforming baselines inspired by conventional approaches to code analysis. We further show that the smaller, cost-effective variant (GPT-4o-mini) achieves results on par with state-of-the-art (GPT-4o) after fine-tuning, creating promising implications for smaller models for real-time grading. These smaller models can be incorporated into autograders for open-ended code-writing exercises to provide feedback for students' implicit planning skills, even when their program is syntactically incorrect. Furthermore, LLMs may be useful in providing feedback for problems in other domains where students start with a set of high-level solution steps and iteratively compute the output, such as math and physics problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as full paper at AIED 2025</p></details> |

Automated quantum circuit synthesis via quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising solution, employing trainable parametric quantum circuits to alleviate this. The circuit ansatz in these solutions is often designed through reinforcement learning-based quantum architecture search when the domain knowledge of the problem and hardware are not effective. However, the interpretability of these synthesized circuits remains a significant bottleneck, limiting their scalability and applicability across diverse problem domains. This work addresses the challenge of explainability in quantum architecture search (QAS) by introducing a novel genetic programming-based decompiler framework for reverse-engineering high-level quantum algorithms from low-level circuit representations. The proposed approach, implemented in the open-source tool DeQompile, employs program synthesis techniques, including symbolic regression and abstract syntax tree manipulation, to distill interpretable Qiskit algorithms from quantum assembly language. Validation of benchmark algorithms demonstrates the efficacy of our tool. By integrating the decompiler with online learning frameworks, this research potentiates explainable QAS by fostering the development of generalizable and provable quantum algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Inequality constraints are handled using a primal-dual interior point formulation and step acceptance for equality constraints follows a line-search filter approach. The iterates of the algorithm are derived under the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) framework. Our numerical experiments evaluate IPDDP2 on four robotic motion planning problems. IPDDP2 reliably converges to low optimality error and exhibits local quadratic and global convergence from remote starting points. Notably, we showcase the robustness of IPDDP2 by using it to solve a contact-implicit, joint limited acrobot swing-up problem involving complementarity constraints from a range of initial conditions.

By formalizing the relationships between data elements in this topological space, our approach allows for more intuitive modeling of complex systems where a topology of connections is formed for the underlying computational model. This paradigm addresses limitations in traditional OOP when representing a wide range of problems in computer science such as agent-based systems, social networks, processing on relational data, neural networks, distributed systems, finite state machines, and other spatially-oriented computational problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 41 pages with appendix</p></details> |
| **[The nature of loops in programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08126v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In program semantics and verification, reasoning about loops is complicated by the need to produce two separate mathematical arguments: an invariant, for functional properties (ignoring termination); and a variant, for termination (ignoring functional properties). A single and simple definition is possible, removing this split. A loop is just the limit (a variant of the reflexive transitive closure) of a Noetherian (well-founded) relation. To prove the loop correct there is no need to devise an invariant and a variant; it suffices to identify the relation, yielding both partial correctness and termination. The present note develops the (small) theory and applies it to standard loop examples and proofs of their correctness.</p></details> |  |

| **[L0-Reasoning Bench: Evaluating Procedural Correctness in Language Models via Simple Program Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22832v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Complex reasoning tasks often rely on the ability to consistently and accurately apply simple rules across incremental steps, a foundational capability which we term "level-0" reasoning. To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce L0-Bench, a language model benchmark for testing procedural correctness -- the ability to generate correct reasoning processes, complementing existing benchmarks that primarily focus on outcome correctness. Given synthetic Python functions with simple operations, L0-Bench grades models on their ability to generate step-by-step, error-free execution traces. The synthetic nature of L0-Bench enables systematic and scalable generation of test programs along various axes (e.g., number of trace steps). We evaluate a diverse array of recent closed-source and open-weight models on a baseline test set. All models exhibit degradation as the number of target trace steps increases, while larger models and reasoning-enhanced models better maintain correctness over multiple steps. Additionally, we use L0-Bench to explore test-time scaling along three dimensions: input context length, number of solutions for majority voting, and inference steps. Our results suggest substantial room to improve "level-0" reasoning and potential directions to build more reliable reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Genetic Programming with Reinforcement Learning Trained Transformer for Real-World Dynamic Scheduling Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07779v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic scheduling in real-world environments often struggles to adapt to unforeseen disruptions, making traditional static scheduling methods and human-designed heuristics inadequate. This paper introduces an innovative approach that combines Genetic Programming (GP) with a Transformer trained through Reinforcement Learning (GPRT), specifically designed to tackle the complexities of dynamic scheduling scenarios. GPRT leverages the Transformer to refine heuristics generated by GP while also seeding and guiding the evolution of GP. This dual functionality enhances the adaptability and effectiveness of the scheduling heuristics, enabling them to better respond to the dynamic nature of real-world tasks. The efficacy of this integrated approach is demonstrated through a practical application in container terminal truck scheduling, where the GPRT method outperforms traditional GP, standalone Transformer methods, and other state-of-the-art competitors. The key contribution of this research is the development of the GPRT method, which showcases a novel combination of GP and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to produce robust and efficient scheduling solutions. Importantly, GPRT is not limited to container port truck scheduling; it offers a versatile framework applicable to various dynamic scheduling challenges. Its practicality, coupled with its interpretability and ease of modification, makes it a valuable tool for diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

A unique adaptive intervention design paradigm is presented in this work, where causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are for effectively recovered with practical budgetary considerations. In order to choose treatments that optimize information gain under these considerations, an iterative integer programming (IP) approach is proposed, which drastically reduces the number of experiments required. Simulations over a broad range of graph sizes and edge densities are used to assess the effectiveness of the suggested approach. Results show that the proposed adaptive IP approach achieves full causal graph recovery with fewer intervention iterations and variable manipulations than random intervention baselines, and it is also flexible enough to accommodate a variety of practical constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Formal Verification of Quantum Error Correcting Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07732v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum error correction (QEC) is fundamental for suppressing noise in quantum hardware and enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation. In this paper, we propose an efficient verification framework for QEC programs. We define an assertion logic and a program logic specifically crafted for QEC programs and establish a sound proof system. We then develop an efficient method for handling verification conditions (VCs) of QEC programs: for Pauli errors, the VCs are reduced to classical assertions that can be solved by SMT solvers, and for non-Pauli errors, we provide a heuristic algorithm. We formalize the proposed program logic in Coq proof assistant, making it a verified QEC verifier. Additionally, we implement an automated QEC verifier, Veri-QEC, for verifying various fault-tolerant scenarios. We demonstrate the efficiency and broad functionality of the framework by performing different verification tasks across various scenarios. Finally, we present a benchmark of 14 verified stabilizer codes.</p></details> | 41 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Parallel Domain-Decomposition Algorithms for Complexity Certification of Branch-and-Bound Algorithms for Mixed-Integer Linear and Quadratic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16411v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When implementing model predictive control (MPC) for hybrid systems with a linear or a quadratic performance measure, a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) or a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) needs to be solved, respectively, at each sampling instant. Recent work has introduced the possibility to certify the computational complexity of branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithms when solving MILP and MIQP problems formulated as multi-parametric MILPs (mp-MILPs) and mp-MIQPs. Such a framework allows for computing the worst-case computational complexity of standard B&B-based MILP and MIQP solvers, quantified by metrics such as the total number of LP/QP iterations and B&B nodes. These results are highly relevant for real-time hybrid MPC applications. In this paper, we extend this framework by developing parallel, domain-decomposition versions of the previously proposed algorithm, allowing it to scale to larger problem sizes and enable the use of high-performance computing (HPC) resources. Furthermore, to reduce peak memory consumption, we introduce two novel modifications to the existing (serial) complexity certification framework, integrating them into the proposed parallel algorithms. Numerical experiments show that the parallel algorithms significantly reduce computation time while maintaining the correctness of the original framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unifying Complexity-Certification Framework for Branch-and-Bound Algorithms for Mixed-Integer Linear and Quadratic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16235v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In model predictive control (MPC) for hybrid systems, solving optimization problems efficiently and with guarantees on worst-case computational complexity is critical to satisfy the real-time constraints in these applications. These optimization problems often take the form of mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) or mixed-integer quadratic programs (MIQPs) that depend on system parameters. A common approach for solving such problems is the branch-and-bound (B&B) method. This paper extends existing complexity certification methods by presenting a unified complexity-certification framework for B&B-based MILP and MIQP solvers, specifically for the family of multi-parametric MILP and MIQP problems that arise in, e.g., hybrid MPC applications. The framework provides guarantees on worst-case computational measures, including the maximum number of iterations or relaxations B&B algorithms require to reach optimality. It systematically accounts for different branching and node selection strategies, as well as heuristics integrated into B&B, ensuring a comprehensive certification framework. By offering theoretical guarantees and practical insights for solver customization, the proposed framework enhances the reliability of B&B for real-time application. The usefulness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through numerical experiments on both random MILPs and MIQPs, as well as on MIQPs arising from a hybrid MPC problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthesizing High-Quality Programming Tasks with LLM-based Expert and Student Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07655v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI is transforming computing education by enabling the automatic generation of personalized content and feedback. We investigate its capabilities in providing high-quality programming tasks to students. Despite promising advancements in task generation, a quality gap remains between AI-generated and expert-created tasks. The AI-generated tasks may not align with target programming concepts, could be incomprehensible for students to solve, or may contain critical issues such as incorrect tests. Existing works often require interventions from human teachers for validation. We address these challenges by introducing PyTaskSyn, a novel synthesis technique that first generates a programming task and then decides whether it meets certain quality criteria to be given to students. The key idea is to break this process into multiple stages performed by expert and student agents simulated using both strong and weaker generative models. Through extensive evaluation, we show that PyTaskSyn significantly improves task quality compared to baseline techniques and showcases the importance of each specialized agent type in our validation pipeline. Additionally, we conducted user studies using our publicly available web application and show that PyTaskSyn can deliver high-quality programming tasks comparable to expert-designed ones while reducing workload and costs, and being more engaging than programming tasks that are available in online resources.</p></details> | AIED'25 paper |
| **[Cache-a-lot: Pushing the Limits of Unsatisfiable Core Reuse in SMT-Based Program Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07642v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers are integral to program analysis techniques like concolic and symbolic execution, where they help assess the satisfiability of logical formulae to explore execution paths of the program under test. However, frequent solver invocations are still the main performance bottleneck of these techniques. One way to mitigate this challenge is through optimizations such as caching and reusing solver results. While current methods typically focus on reusing results from fully equivalent or closely related formulas, they often miss broader opportunities for reuse. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Cache-a-lot, that extends the reuse of unsatisfiable (unsat) results by systematically considering all possible variable substitutions. This enables more extensive reuse of results, thereby reducing the number of SMT solver invocations and improving the overall efficiency of concolic and symbolic execution. Our evaluation, conducted against the state-of-the-art Utopia solution using two benchmark sets, shows significant improvements, particularly with more complex formulas. Our method achieves up to 74% unsat core reuse, compared to Utopia's 41%, and significant increase in the time savings. These results demonstrate that, despite the additional computational complexity, the broader reuse of unsat results significantly enhances performance, offering valuable advancements for formal verification and program analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards a Computational Quantum Logic: An Overview of an Ongoing Research Program](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07609v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This invited paper presents an overview of an ongoing research program aimed at extending the Curry-Howard-Lambek correspondence to quantum computation. We explore two key frameworks that provide both logical and computational foundations for quantum programming languages. The first framework, the Lambda-$S$ calculus, extends the lambda calculus by incorporating quantum superposition, enforcing linearity, and ensuring unitarity, to model quantum control. Its categorical semantics establishes a structured connection between classical and quantum computation through an adjunction between Cartesian closed categiries and additive symmetric monoidal closed categories. The second framework, the $\mathcal L^{\mathbb C}$ calculus, introduces a proof language for intuitionistic linear logic augmented with sum and scalar operations. This enables the formal encoding of quantum superpositions and measurements, leading to a computational model grounded in categorical structures with biproducts. These approaches suggest a fundamental duality between quantum computation and linear logic, highlighting structural correspondences between logical proofs and quantum programs. We discuss ongoing developments, including extensions to polymorphism, categorical and realizability models, as well as the integration of the modality !, which further solidify the connection between logic and quantum programming languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>Invit...</summary><p>Invited talk at the Quantum Computing session at CiE 2025</p></details> |
