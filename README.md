| **[LitterBox+: An Extensible Framework for LLM-enhanced Scratch Static Code Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12021v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have become an essential tool to support developers using traditional text-based programming languages, but the graphical notation of the block-based Scratch programming environment inhibits the use of LLMs. To overcome this limitation, we propose the LitterBox+ framework that extends the Scratch static code analysis tool LitterBox with the generative abilities of LLMs. By converting block-based code to a textual representation suitable for LLMs, LitterBox+ allows users to query LLMs about their programs, about quality issues reported by LitterBox, and it allows generating code fixes. Besides offering a programmatic API for these functionalities, LitterBox+ also extends the Scratch user interface to make these functionalities available directly in the environment familiar to learners. The framework is designed to be easily extensible with other prompts, LLM providers, and new features combining the program analysis capabilities of LitterBox with the generative features of LLMs. We provide a screencast demonstrating the tool at https://youtu.be/RZ6E0xgrIgQ.</p></details> | <details><summary>ASE 2...</summary><p>ASE 2025 Tool Demonstration Track</p></details> |
| **[Can Code-Switched Texts Activate a Knowledge Switch in LLMs? A Case Study on English-Korean Code-Switching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18436v4)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate multilingual abilities, yet they are English-centric due to dominance of English in training corpora. The limited resource for low-resource languages remains a crucial challenge. Code-switching (CS), a phenomenon where multilingual speakers alternate between languages in a discourse, can convey subtle cultural and linguistic nuances that can be otherwise lost in translation and elicits language-specific knowledge in human communications. In light of this, we investigate whether code-switching can activate, or identify and leverage knowledge for reasoning when LLMs solve low-resource language tasks. To facilitate the research, we first present EnKoQA, a synthetic English-Korean CS question-answering dataset. We provide comprehensive analysis on a variety of multilingual LLMs by subdividing activation process into knowledge identification and knowledge leveraging. Our results demonstrate that compared to English text, CS can faithfully activate knowledge inside LLMs especially on language-specific domains, suggesting the potential of code-switching on low-resource language tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to EMNLP 2025 Findings</p></details> |
| **[On Code-Induced Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21499v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code data has been shown to enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), but it remains unclear which aspects of code are most responsible. We investigate this question with a systematic, data-centric framework. We construct parallel instruction datasets in ten programming languages and apply controlled perturbations that selectively disrupt structural or semantic properties of code. We then finetune LLMs from five model families and eight scales on each variant and evaluate their performance on natural language, math, and code tasks. Across 3,331 experiments, our results show that LLMs are more vulnerable to structural perturbations than semantic ones, particularly on math and code tasks. Appropriate abstractions like pseudocode and flowcharts can be as effective as code, while encoding the same information with fewer tokens without adhering to original syntax can often retain or even improve performance. Remarkably, even corrupted code with misleading signals remains competitive when surface-level regularities persist. Finally, syntactic styles also shape task-specific gains with Python favoring natural language reasoning and lower-level languages such as Java and Rust favoring math. Through our systematic framework, we aim to provide insight into how different properties of code influence reasoning and inform the design of training data for enhancing LLM reasoning capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[SIEVE: Towards Verifiable Certification for Code-datasets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02166v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code agents and empirical software engineering rely on public code datasets, yet these datasets lack verifiable quality guarantees. Static 'dataset cards' inform, but they are neither auditable nor do they offer statistical guarantees, making it difficult to attest to dataset quality. Teams build isolated, ad-hoc cleaning pipelines. This fragments effort and raises cost. We present SIEVE, a community-driven framework. It turns per-property checks into Confidence Cards-machine-readable, verifiable certificates with anytime-valid statistical bounds. We outline a research plan to bring SIEVE to maturity, replacing narrative cards with anytime-verifiable certification. This shift is expected to lower quality-assurance costs and increase trust in code-datasets.</p></details> | 5 |
| **[CodeSense: a Real-World Benchmark and Dataset for Code Semantic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00750v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and reasoning about code semantics is essential for enhancing code LLMs' abilities to solve real-world software engineering (SE) tasks. Although several code reasoning benchmarks exist, most rely on synthetic datasets or educational coding problems and focus on coarse-grained reasoning tasks such as input/output prediction, limiting their effectiveness in evaluating LLMs in practical SE contexts. To bridge this gap, we propose CodeSense, the first benchmark that makes available a spectrum of fine-grained code reasoning tasks concerned with the software engineering of real-world code. We collected Python, C and Java software projects from real-world repositories. We executed tests from these repositories, collected their execution traces, and constructed a ground truth dataset for fine-grained semantic reasoning tasks. We then performed comprehensive evaluations on state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results show a clear performance gap for the models to handle fine-grained reasoning tasks. Although prompting techniques such as chain-of-thought and in-context learning helped, the lack of code semantics in LLMs fundamentally limit models' capabilities of code reasoning. Besides dataset, benchmark and evaluation, our work produced an execution tracing framework and tool set that make it easy to collect ground truth for fine-grained SE reasoning tasks, offering a strong basis for future benchmark construction and model post training. Our code and data are located at https://codesense-bench.github.io/.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum channel coding: Approximation algorithms and strong converse exponents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21124v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study relaxations of entanglement-assisted quantum channel coding and establish that non-signaling assistance and a natural semi-definite programming relaxation\, -- \,termed meta-converse\, -- \,are equivalent in terms of success probabilities. We then present a rounding procedure that transforms any non-signaling-assisted strategy into an entanglement-assisted one and prove an approximation ratio of $(1 - e^{-1})$ in success probabilities for the special case of measurement channels. For fully quantum channels, we give a weaker (dimension dependent) approximation ratio, that is nevertheless still tight to characterize the strong converse exponent of entanglement-assisted channel coding [Li and Yao, IEEE Tran.~Inf.~Theory (2024)]. Our derivations leverage ideas from position-based coding, quantum decoupling theorems, the matrix Chernoff inequality, and input flattening techniques.</p></details> | 28+8 pages, 1 Figure |
| **[The dimension and Bose distance of some BCH codes of length $\frac{q^{m}-1}Î»$](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02020v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>BCH codes are important error correction codes, widely utilized due to their robust algebraic structure, multi-error correcting capability, and efficient decoding algorithms. Despite their practical importance and extensive study, their parameters, including dimension, minimum distance and Bose distance, remain largely unknown in general. This paper addresses this challenge by investigating the dimension and Bose distance of BCH codes of length $(q^m - 1)/\lambda$ over the finite field $\mathbb{F}_q$, where $\lambda$ is a positive divisor of $q - 1$. Specifically, for narrow-sense BCH codes of this length with $m \geq 4$, we derive explicit formulas for their dimension for designed distance $2 \leq \delta \leq (q^{\lfloor (2m - 1)/3 \rfloor + 1} - 1)/{\lambda} + 1$. We also provide explicit formulas for their Bose distance in the range $2 \leq \delta \leq (q^{\lfloor (2m - 1)/3 \rfloor + 1} - 1)/{\lambda}$. These ranges for $\delta$ are notably larger than the previously known results for this class of BCH codes. Furthermore, we extend these findings to determine the dimension and Bose distance for certain non-narrow-sense BCH codes of the same length. Applying our results, we identify several BCH codes with good parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[List decoding of evaluation codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01811v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Polynomial evaluation codes hold a prominent place in coding theory. In this work, we study the problem of list decoding for a general class of polynomial evaluation codes, also known as Toric codes, that are defined for any given convex polytope P. Special cases, such as Reed-Solomon and Reed-Muller codes, have been studied extensively. We present a generalization of the Guruswami-Sudan algorithm that takes into account the geometry and the combinatorics of P and compute bounds for the decoding radius.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Algebraic Approaches for DNA Codes with Multiple Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01750v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DNA strings and their properties are widely studied since last 20 years due to its applications in DNA computing. In this area, one designs a set of DNA strings (called DNA code) which satisfies certain thermodynamic and combinatorial constraints such as reverse constraint, reverse-complement constraint, $GC$-content constraint and Hamming constraint. However recent applications of DNA codes in DNA data storage resulted in many new constraints on DNA codes such as avoiding tandem repeats constraint (a generalization of non-homopolymer constraint) and avoiding secondary structures constraint. Therefore, in this chapter, we introduce DNA codes with recently developed constraints. In particular, we discuss reverse, reverse-complement, $GC$-content, Hamming, uncorrelated-correlated, thermodynamic, avoiding tandem repeats and avoiding secondary structures constraints. DNA codes are constructed using various approaches such as algebraic, computational, and combinatorial. In particular, in algebraic approaches, one uses a finite ring and a map to construct a DNA code. Most of such approaches does not yield DNA codes with high Hamming distance. In this chapter, we focus on algebraic constructions using maps (usually an isometry on some finite ring) which yields DNA codes with high Hamming distance. We focus on non-cyclic DNA codes. We briefly discuss various metrics such as Gau distance, Non-Homopolymer distance etc. We discuss about algebraic constructions of families of DNA codes that satisfy multiple constraints and/or properties. Further, we also discuss about algebraic bounds on DNA codes with multiple constraints. Finally, we present some open research directions in this area.</p></details> | 54 pages, draft |
| **[Antenna Coding Empowered by Pixel Antennas](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06642v2)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pixel antennas, based on discretizing a continuous radiation surface into small elements called pixels, are a flexible reconfigurable antenna technology. By controlling the connections between pixels via switches, the characteristics of pixel antennas can be adjusted to enhance the wireless channel. Inspired by this, we propose a novel technique denoted antenna coding empowered by pixel antennas. We first derive a physical and electromagnetic based communication model for pixel antennas using microwave multiport network theory and beamspace channel representation. With the model, we optimize the antenna coding to maximize the channel gain in a single-input single-output (SISO) pixel antenna system and develop a codebook design for antenna coding to reduce the computational complexity. We analyze the average channel gain of SISO pixel antenna system and derive the corresponding upper bound. In addition, we jointly optimize the antenna coding and transmit signal covariance matrix to maximize the channel capacity in a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) pixel antenna system. Simulation results show that using pixel antennas can enhance the average channel gain by up to 5.4 times and channel capacity by up to 3.1 times, demonstrating the significant potential of pixel antennas as a new dimension to design and optimize wireless communication systems.</p></details> | 16 pages, 11 figures |
| **[Executable Counterfactuals: Improving LLMs' Causal Reasoning Through Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01539v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Counterfactual reasoning, a hallmark of intelligence, consists of three steps: inferring latent variables from observations (abduction), constructing alternatives (interventions), and predicting their outcomes (prediction). This skill is essential for advancing LLMs' causal understanding and expanding their applications in high-stakes domains such as scientific research. However, existing efforts in assessing LLM's counterfactual reasoning capabilities tend to skip the abduction step, effectively reducing to interventional reasoning and leading to overestimation of LLM performance. To address this, we introduce executable counterfactuals, a novel framework that operationalizes causal reasoning through code and math problems. Our framework explicitly requires all three steps of counterfactual reasoning and enables scalable synthetic data creation with varying difficulty, creating a frontier for evaluating and improving LLM's reasoning. Our results reveal substantial drop in accuracy (25-40%) from interventional to counterfactual reasoning for SOTA models like o4-mini and Claude-4-Sonnet. To address this gap, we construct a training set comprising counterfactual code problems having if-else condition and test on out-of-domain code structures (e.g. having while-loop); we also test whether a model trained on code would generalize to counterfactual math word problems. While supervised finetuning on stronger models' reasoning traces improves in-domain performance of Qwen models, it leads to a decrease in accuracy on OOD tasks such as counterfactual math problems. In contrast, reinforcement learning induces the core cognitive behaviors and generalizes to new domains, yielding gains over the base model on both code (improvement of 1.5x-2x) and math problems. Analysis of the reasoning traces reinforces these findings and highlights the promise of RL for improving LLMs' counterfactual reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[PurpCode: Reasoning for Safer Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19060v3)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce PurpCode, the first post-training recipe for training safe code reasoning models towards generating secure code and defending against malicious cyberactivities. PurpCode trains a reasoning model in two stages: (i) Rule Learning, which explicitly teaches the model to reference cybersafety rules to generate vulnerability-free code and to avoid facilitating malicious cyberactivities; and (ii) Reinforcement Learning, which optimizes model safety and preserves model utility through diverse, multi-objective reward mechanisms. To empower the training pipelines with comprehensive cybersafety data, we conduct internal red-teaming to synthesize comprehensive and high-coverage prompts based on real-world tasks for inducing unsafe cyberactivities in the model. Based on PurpCode, we develop a reasoning-based coding model, namely PurpCode-32B, which demonstrates state-of-the-art cybersafety, outperforming various frontier models. Meanwhile, our alignment method decreases the model overrefusal rates in both general and cybersafety-specific scenarios, while preserving model utility in both code generation and common security knowledge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Single LLMs: Enhanced Code Generation via Multi-Stage Performance-Guided LLM Orchestration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01379v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have become the predominant paradigm for automated code generation, current single-model approaches fundamentally ignore the heterogeneous computational strengths that different models exhibit across programming languages, algorithmic domains, and development stages. This paper challenges the single-model convention by introducing a multi-stage, performance-guided orchestration framework that dynamically routes coding tasks to the most suitable LLMs within a structured generate-fix-refine workflow. Our approach is grounded in a comprehensive empirical study of 17 state-of-the-art LLMs across five programming languages (Python, Java, C++, Go, and Rust) using HumanEval-X benchmark. The study, which evaluates both functional correctness and runtime performance metrics (execution time, mean/max memory utilization, and CPU efficiency), reveals pronounced performance heterogeneity by language, development stage, and problem category. Guided by these empirical insights, we present PerfOrch, an LLM agent that orchestrates top-performing LLMs for each task context through stage-wise validation and rollback mechanisms. Without requiring model fine-tuning, PerfOrch achieves substantial improvements over strong single-model baselines: average correctness rates of 96.22% and 91.37% on HumanEval-X and EffiBench-X respectively, surpassing GPT-4o's 78.66% and 49.11%. Beyond correctness gains, the framework delivers consistent performance optimizations, improving execution time for 58.76% of problems with median speedups ranging from 17.67% to 27.66% across languages on two benchmarks. The framework's plug-and-play architecture ensures practical scalability, allowing new LLMs to be profiled and integrated seamlessly, thereby offering a paradigm for production-grade automated software engineering that adapts to the rapidly evolving generative AI landscape.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the Code: Security Assessment of AI Code Agents Through Systematic Jailbreaking Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01359v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code-capable large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly embedded into software engineering workflows where they can read, write, and execute code, raising the stakes of safety-bypass ("jailbreak") attacks beyond text-only settings. Prior evaluations emphasize refusal or harmful-text detection, leaving open whether agents actually compile and run malicious programs. We present JAWS-BENCH (Jailbreaks Across WorkSpaces), a benchmark spanning three escalating workspace regimes that mirror attacker capability: empty (JAWS-0), single-file (JAWS-1), and multi-file (JAWS-M). We pair this with a hierarchical, executable-aware Judge Framework that tests (i) compliance, (ii) attack success, (iii) syntactic correctness, and (iv) runtime executability, moving beyond refusal to measure deployable harm. Using seven LLMs from five families as backends, we find that under prompt-only conditions in JAWS-0, code agents accept 61% of attacks on average; 58% are harmful, 52% parse, and 27% run end-to-end. Moving to single-file regime in JAWS-1 drives compliance to ~ 100% for capable models and yields a mean ASR (Attack Success Rate) ~ 71%; the multi-file regime (JAWS-M) raises mean ASR to ~ 75%, with 32% instantly deployable attack code. Across models, wrapping an LLM in an agent substantially increases vulnerability -- ASR raises by 1.6x -- because initial refusals are frequently overturned during later planning/tool-use steps. Category-level analyses identify which attack classes are most vulnerable and most readily deployable, while others exhibit large execution gaps. These findings motivate execution-aware defenses, code-contextual safety filters, and mechanisms that preserve refusal decisions throughout the agent's multi-step reasoning and tool use.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 21 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Code2Video: A Code-centric Paradigm for Educational Video Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01174v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent generative models advance pixel-space video synthesis, they remain limited in producing professional educational videos, which demand disciplinary knowledge, precise visual structures, and coherent transitions, limiting their applicability in educational scenarios. Intuitively, such requirements are better addressed through the manipulation of a renderable environment, which can be explicitly controlled via logical commands (e.g., code). In this work, we propose Code2Video, a code-centric agent framework for generating educational videos via executable Python code. The framework comprises three collaborative agents: (i) Planner, which structures lecture content into temporally coherent flows and prepares corresponding visual assets; (ii) Coder, which converts structured instructions into executable Python codes while incorporating scope-guided auto-fix to enhance efficiency; and (iii) Critic, which leverages vision-language models (VLM) with visual anchor prompts to refine spatial layout and ensure clarity. To support systematic evaluation, we build MMMC, a benchmark of professionally produced, discipline-specific educational videos. We evaluate MMMC across diverse dimensions, including VLM-as-a-Judge aesthetic scores, code efficiency, and particularly, TeachQuiz, a novel end-to-end metric that quantifies how well a VLM, after unlearning, can recover knowledge by watching the generated videos. Our results demonstrate the potential of Code2Video as a scalable, interpretable, and controllable approach, achieving 40% improvement over direct code generation and producing videos comparable to human-crafted tutorials.

Unlike reusing code taken from the Web, for LLMs' generated code, developers are concerned about its lack of trustworthiness and possible copyright or licensing violations, due to the lack of code provenance information. This paper proposes CodeGenLink, a GitHub CoPilot extension for Visual Studio Code aimed at (i) suggesting links containing code very similar to automatically generated code, and (ii) whenever possible, indicating the license of the likely origin of the code. CodeGenLink retrieves candidate links by combining LLMs with their web search features and then performs similarity analysis between the generated and retrieved code. Preliminary results show that CodeGenLink effectively filters unrelated links via similarity analysis and provides licensing information when available.

| **[Layered Normalized Min-Sum Decoding with Bit Flipping for FDPC Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01019v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fair-density parity-check (FDPC) codes have been recently introduced demonstrating improved performance compared to low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes standardized in 5G systems particularly in high-rate regimes. In this paper, we introduce a layered normalized min-sum (LNMS) message-passing decoding algorithm for the FDPC codes. We also introduce a syndrome-guided bit flipping (SGBF) method to enhance the error-correction performance of our proposed decoder. The LNMS decoder leverages conflict graph coloring for efficient layered scheduling, enabling faster convergence by grouping non-conflicting check nodes and updating variable nodes immediately after each layer. In the event of decoding failure, the SGBF method is activated, utilizing a novel reliability metric that combines log-likelihood ratio (LLR) magnitudes and syndrome-derived error counts to identify the least reliable bits. A set of candidate sequences is then generated by performing single-bit flips at these positions, with each candidate re-decoded via LNMS. The optimal candidate is selected based on the minimum syndrome weight. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed decoder. Numerical simulations on FDPC$(256,192)$ code with a bit-flipping set size of $T = 128$ and a maximum of $5$ iterations demonstrate that the proposed decoder achieves approximately a $0.5\,\mathrm{dB}$ coding gain over standalone LNMS decoding at a frame error rate (FER) of $10^{-3}$, while providing coding gains of $0.75-1.5\,\mathrm{dB}$ over other state-of-the-art codes including polar codes and 5G-LDPC codes at the same length and rate and also under belief propagation decoding.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving Code Localization with Repository Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01003v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code localization is a fundamental challenge in repository-level software engineering tasks such as bug fixing. While existing methods equip language agents with comprehensive tools/interfaces to fetch information from the repository, they overlook the critical aspect of memory, where each instance is typically handled from scratch assuming no prior repository knowledge. In contrast, human developers naturally build long-term repository memory, such as the functionality of key modules and associations between various bug types and their likely fix locations. In this work, we augment language agents with such memory by leveraging a repository's commit history - a rich yet underutilized resource that chronicles the codebase's evolution. We introduce tools that allow the agent to retrieve from a non-parametric memory encompassing recent historical commits and linked issues, as well as functionality summaries of actively evolving parts of the codebase identified via commit patterns. We demonstrate that augmenting such a memory can significantly improve LocAgent, a state-of-the-art localization framework, on both SWE-bench-verified and the more recent SWE-bench-live benchmarks. Our research contributes towards developing agents that can accumulate and leverage past experience for long-horizon tasks, more closely emulating the expertise of human developers.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |
| **[ChatGPT in Introductory Programming: Counterbalanced Evaluation of Code Quality, Conceptual Learning, and Student Perceptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00946v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT are increasingly used in introductory programming courses to provide real-time code generation, debugging, and explanations. While these tools can boost productivity and code quality, concerns remain about over-reliance and potential impacts on conceptual learning. Objective: To investigate how ChatGPT access affects code quality, conceptual understanding, task completion times, and student perceptions in a CS1 course. Methods: We conducted a counterbalanced, quasi-experimental study in which students alternated between ChatGPT and non-ChatGPT conditions across two programming assignments in C (functions and structures). We evaluated their code submissions using multidimensional rubrics, conceptual post-surveys, and task completion time. Results: Students who had access to ChatGPT produced significantly higher rubric scores for code quality and completed tasks in less time compared to those without access. However, gains in conceptual understanding were mixed, lower for the functions topic but higher for the structures topic. Students reported positive experiences with ChatGPT, citing its value for debugging and practice, while expressing concerns about accuracy and long-term skill development. Conclusions: ChatGPT can enhance code quality and efficiency for novice programmers, but may not uniformly improve conceptual understanding. Structured integration and complementary instructional strategies are recommended to foster independent problem-solving skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGCITE'25</p></details> |
| **[On Effective Semantic Translation for Code: A Study Based on Pseudocode](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00920v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) show great potential in code translation. However, accurate translation remains challenging when using the commonly adopted direct code-to-code translation approach, which converts a program into the target programming language (PL) in a single step. Inspired by the success of incorporating intermediate steps to guide LLMs in resolving challenging tasks, we explore pseudocode-based code translation, which emulates the human semantic translation by first interpreting the program's intent and logic into pseudocode and then implementing it in the target PL. We find that pseudocode-based translation helps translate programs that direct translation struggles to handle. Nonetheless, the effectiveness, advantages, and limitations of this approach remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present an empirical study on pseudocode-based code translation, aiming to investigate its effectiveness in enhancing the direct translation approach, illuminate its effective usage, and identify limitations hindering its potential benefits. By comparing direct and pseudocode-based translation approaches on 9,690 translation tasks across six PLs with five popular LLMs, we demonstrate that pseudocode-based translation can effectively complement direct translation, particularly when translating from flexible to rigid PLs or dealing with low-resource Rust. Based on these findings, we suggest adopting strategies that combine the complementary strengths of both approaches to enhance code translation accuracy. We also reveal the advantages of pseudocode-based translation in disentangling translations of complicated programs and mitigating distractions from detailed implementations in original programs, as well as its limitations due to incorrect, incomplete, or ambiguous pseudocode.</p></details> |  |

We introduce Code Like Humans: a new agentic framework for medical coding with large language models. It implements official coding guidelines for human experts, and it is the first solution that can support the full ICD-10 coding system (+70K labels). It achieves the best performance to date on rare diagnosis codes (fine-tuned discriminative classifiers retain an advantage for high-frequency codes, to which they are limited). Towards future work, we also contribute an analysis of system performance and identify its `blind spots' (codes that are systematically undercoded).</p></details> | EMNLP Findings 2025 |
| **[CodeChemist: Functional Knowledge Transfer for Low-Resource Code Generation via Test-Time Scaling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00501v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code Large Language Models (CodeLLMs) are increasingly used in code generation tasks across a wide range of applications. However, their performance is often inconsistent across different programming languages (PLs), with low-resource PLs suffering the most due to limited training data. In this paper, we present CodeChemist, a novel and efficient framework for test-time scaling that enables functional knowledge transfer from high-resource to low-resource PLs using generated test cases. CodeChemist first generates and executes code in high-resource PLs to create test cases that encapsulate functional knowledge. It then uses multi-temperature hedged sampling to generate code snippets in the low-resource PL and selects the best one based on the pass rate of the test cases. Our extensive experiments show that CodeChemist outperforms existing test-time scaling approaches, boosting the performance of code generation for low-resource PLs without requiring any model retraining.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analyzing Latent Concepts in Code Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00476v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interpreting the internal behavior of large language models trained on code remains a critical challenge, particularly for applications demanding trust, transparency, and semantic robustness. We propose Code Concept Analysis (CoCoA): a global post-hoc interpretability framework that uncovers emergent lexical, syntactic, and semantic structures in a code language model's representation space by clustering contextualized token embeddings into human-interpretable concept groups. We propose a hybrid annotation pipeline that combines static analysis tool-based syntactic alignment with prompt-engineered large language models (LLMs), enabling scalable labeling of latent concepts across abstraction levels. We analyse the distribution of concepts across layers and across three finetuning tasks. Emergent concept clusters can help identify unexpected latent interactions and be used to identify trends and biases within the model's learned representations. We further integrate LCA with local attribution methods to produce concept-grounded explanations, improving the coherence and interpretability of token-level saliency. Empirical evaluations across multiple models and tasks show that LCA discovers concepts that remain stable under semantic-preserving perturbations (average Cluster Sensitivity Index, CSI = 0.288) and evolve predictably with fine-tuning. In a user study, concept-augmented explanations disambiguate token roles.

While recent advances enable code LLMs to process long inputs, high API costs and generation latency remain substantial bottlenecks. Existing context pruning techniques, such as LLMLingua, achieve promising results for general text but overlook code-specific structures and dependencies, leading to suboptimal performance in programming tasks. In this paper, we propose LongCodeZip, a novel plug-and-play code compression framework designed specifically for code LLMs. LongCodeZip employs a dual-stage strategy: (1) coarse-grained compression, which identifies and ranks function-level chunks using conditional perplexity with respect to the instruction, retaining only the most relevant functions; and (2) fine-grained compression, which segments retained functions into blocks based on perplexity and selects an optimal subset under an adaptive token budget to maximize relevance. Evaluations across multiple tasks, including code completion, summarization, and question answering, show that LongCodeZip consistently outperforms baseline methods, achieving up to a 5.6x compression ratio without degrading task performance. By effectively reducing context size while preserving essential information, LongCodeZip enables LLMs to better scale to real-world, large-scale code scenarios, advancing the efficiency and capability of code intelligence applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ASE 2025.

Vibe coding is the practice where users rely on AI code generation tools through intuition and trial-and-error without necessarily understanding the underlying code. Despite widespread adoption, no research has systematically investigated why users engage in vibe coding, what they experience while doing so, and how they approach quality assurance (QA) and perceive the quality of the AI-generated code. To this end, we conduct a systematic grey literature review of 101 practitioner sources, extracting 518 firsthand behavioral accounts about vibe coding practices, challenges, and limitations. Our analysis reveals a speed-quality trade-off paradox, where vibe coders are motivated by speed and accessibility, often experiencing rapid ``instant success and flow'', yet most perceive the resulting code as fast but flawed. QA practices are frequently overlooked, with many skipping testing, relying on the models' or tools' outputs without modification, or delegating checks back to the AI code generation tools. This creates a new class of vulnerable software developers, particularly those who build a product but are unable to debug it when issues arise. We argue that vibe coding lowers barriers and accelerates prototyping, but at the cost of reliability and maintainability. These insights carry implications for tool designers and software development teams. Understanding how vibe coding is practiced today is crucial for guiding its responsible use and preventing a broader QA crisis in AI-assisted development.</p></details> |  |
| **[Which Programming Language and Model Work Best With LLM-as-a-Judge For Code Retrieval?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00324v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code search is an important information retrieval application. Benefits of better code search include faster new developer on-boarding, reduced software maintenance, and ease of understanding for large repositories. Despite improvements in search algorithms and search benchmarks, the domain of code search has lagged behind. One reason is the high cost of human annotation for code queries and answers. While humans may annotate search results in general text QA systems, code annotations require specialized knowledge of a programming language (PL), as well as domain specific software engineering knowledge. In this work we study the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to retrieve code at the level of functions and to generate annotations for code search results. We compare the impact of the retriever representation (sparse vs. semantic), programming language, and LLM by comparing human annotations across several popular languages (C, Java, Javascript, Go, and Python). We focus on repositories that implement common data structures likely to be implemented in any PLs. For the same human annotations, we compare several LLM-as-a-Judge models to evaluate programming language and other affinities between LLMs. We find that the chosen retriever and PL exhibit affinities that can be leveraged to improve alignment of human and AI relevance determinations, with significant performance implications. We also find differences in representation (sparse vs. semantic) across PLs that impact alignment of human and AI relevance determinations. We propose using transpilers to bootstrap scalable code search benchmark datasets in other PLs and in a case study demonstrate that human-AI relevance agreement rates largely match the (worst case) human-human agreement under study. The application code used in this work is available at \href{https://github.com/rlucas7/code-searcher/}{this github repo}.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a full paper at SIGIR-AP 2025</p></details> |

In addition, it can be incorporated into the inference pipeline to randomize the model and enhance robustness against adversarial perturbations. The design of coded-smoothing is inspired by general coded computing, a paradigm originally developed to mitigate straggler and adversarial failures in distributed computing by processing linear combinations of the data rather than the raw inputs. Building on this principle, we adapt coded computing to machine learning by designing an efficient and effective regularization mechanism that encourages smoother representations and more generalizable solutions. Extensive experiments on both supervised and unsupervised tasks demonstrate that coded-smoothing consistently improves generalization and achieves state-of-the-art robustness against gradient-based adversarial attacks.</p></details> |  |

| **[Towards Verified Code Reasoning by LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26546v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While LLM-based agents are able to tackle a wide variety of code reasoning questions, the answers are not always correct. This prevents the agent from being useful in situations where high precision is desired: (1) helping a software engineer understand a new code base, (2) helping a software engineer during code review sessions, and (3) ensuring that the code generated by an automated code generation system meets certain requirements (e.g. fixes a bug, improves readability, implements a feature). As a result of this lack of trustworthiness, the agent's answers need to be manually verified before they can be trusted. Manually confirming responses from a code reasoning agent requires human effort and can result in slower developer productivity, which weakens the assistance benefits of the agent. In this paper, we describe a method to automatically validate the answers provided by a code reasoning agent by verifying its reasoning steps. At a very high level, the method consists of extracting a formal representation of the agent's response and, subsequently, using formal verification and program analysis tools to verify the agent's reasoning steps. We applied this approach to a benchmark set of 20 uninitialized variable errors detected by sanitizers and 20 program equivalence queries. For the uninitialized variable errors, the formal verification step was able to validate the agent's reasoning on 13/20 examples, and for the program equivalence queries, the formal verification step successfully caught 6/8 incorrect judgments made by the agent.</p></details> | 43 pages |

While prior methods have resorted to heavy and domain-specific feature engineering, we show that a single unified Regression Language Model (RLM) can simultaneously predict directly from text, (i) the memory footprint of code across multiple high-level languages such as Python and C++, (ii) the latency of Triton GPU kernels, and (iii) the accuracy and speed of trained neural networks represented in ONNX. In particular, a relatively small 300M parameter RLM initialized from T5Gemma, obtains > 0.9 Spearman-rank on competitive programming submissions from APPS, and a single unified model achieves > 0.5 average Spearman-rank across 17 separate languages from CodeNet. Furthermore, the RLM can obtain the highest average Kendall-Tau of 0.46 on five classic NAS design spaces previously dominated by graph neural networks, and simultaneously predict architecture latencies on numerous hardware platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Code to Concept: Evaluating Multiple Coordinated Views in Introductory Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26466v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novice programmers often struggle to understand how code executes and to form the abstract mental models necessary for effective problem-solving, challenges that are amplified in large, diverse introductory courses where students' backgrounds, language proficiencies, and prior experiences vary widely. This study examines whether interactive, multi-representational visualizations, combining synchronized code views, memory diagrams, and conceptual analogies, can help manage cognitive load and foster engagement more effectively than single-visual or text-only approaches. Over a 12-week deployment in a high-enrolment introductory Python course (N = 829), students who relied solely on text-based explanations reported significantly higher immediate mental effort than those using visual aids, although overall cognitive load did not differ significantly among conditions. The multi-representational approach consistently yielded higher engagement than both single-visual and text-only methods. Usage logs indicated that learners' interaction patterns varied with topic complexity, and predictive modelling suggested that early experiences of high cognitive load were associated with lower longer-term perceptions of clarity and helpfulness. Individual differences, including language proficiency and prior programming experience, moderated these patterns. By integrating multiple external representations with scaffolded support adapted to diverse learner profiles, our findings highlight design considerations for creating visualization tools that more effectively support novices learning to program.</p></details> |  |

Recently, researchers have begun to explore automated game development. However, existing approaches face three primary challenges: (1) limited scope to 2D content generation or isolated code snippets; (2) requirement for manual integration of generated components into game engines; and (3) poor performance on handling interactive game logic and state management. While Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) demonstrate potential capabilities to ease the game generation task, a critical gap still remains in translating these outputs into production-ready, executable game projects based on game engines such as Unity and Unreal Engine. To bridge the gap, this paper introduces UniGen, the first end-to-end coordinated multi-agent framework that automates zero-coding development of runnable 3D games from natural language requirements. Specifically, UniGen uses a Planning Agent that interprets user requirements into structured blueprints and engineered logic descriptions; after which a Generation Agent produces executable C# scripts; then an Automation Agent handles engine-specific component binding and scene construction; and lastly a Debugging Agent provides real-time error correction through conversational interaction. We evaluated UniGen on three distinct game prototypes. Results demonstrate that UniGen not only democratizes game creation by requiring no coding from the user, but also reduces development time by 91.4%. We release UniGen at https://github.com/yxwan123/UniGen. A video demonstration is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xyJjFfnxUx0.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel channel model for composite DNA in which composite sequences are decomposed into ordered standard non-composite sequences. The model is designed to handle any alphabet size and composite resolution parameter. We study the problem of reconstructing composite sequences of arbitrary resolution over the binary alphabet under substitution errors. We define two families of error-correcting codes and provide lower and upper bounds on their cardinality. In addition, we analyze the case in which a single deletion error occurs in the channel and present a systematic code construction for this setting. Finally, we briefly discuss the channel's capacity, which remains an open problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |

Foundational models are very effective for popular frameworks that benefit from documentation, examples, and strong community support. In contrast, specialized scientific libraries often lack these resources and may expose unstable APIs under active development, making it difficult for models trained on limited or outdated data. We address these issues for the Gammapy library by developing an agent capable of writing, executing, and validating code in a controlled environment. We present a minimal web demo and an accompanying benchmarking suite. This contribution summarizes the design, reports our current status, and outlines next steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICRC2...</summary><p>ICRC2025 proceedings PoS(ICRC2025)753</p></details> |
| **[Improved Constructions of Linear Codes for Insertions and Deletions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26077v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we study linear error-correcting codes against adversarial insertion-deletion (indel) errors. While most constructions for the indel model are nonlinear, linear codes offer compact representations, efficient encoding, and decoding algorithms, making them highly desirable. A key challenge in this area is achieving rates close to the half-Singleton bound for efficient linear codes over finite fields. We improve upon previous results by constructing explicit codes over \(\mathbb{F}_{q^2}\), linear over \(\mathbb{F}_q\), with rate \(1/2 - \delta - \varepsilon\) that can efficiently correct a \(\delta\)-fraction of indel errors, where \(q = O(\varepsilon^{-4})\). Additionally, we construct fully linear codes over \(\mathbb{F}_q\) with rate \(1/2 - 2\sqrt{\delta} - \varepsilon\) that can also efficiently correct \(\delta\)-fraction of indels. These results significantly advance the study of linear codes for the indel model, bringing them closer to the theoretical half-Singleton bound. We also generalize the half-Singleton bound, for every code \(C \subseteq \mathbb{F}^n\) linear over \(\mathbb{E} \subset \mathbb{F}\) a subfield of $\mathbb{F}$, such that \(C\) has the ability to correct \(\delta\)-fraction of indels, the rate is bounded by $(1-\delta)/2$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating the impact of code smell refactoring on the energy consumption of Android applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26031v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy consumption of mobile apps is a domain that is receiving a lot of attention from researchers. Recent studies indicate that the energy consumption of mobile devices could be improved by improving the quality of mobile apps. Frequent refactoring is one way of achieving this goal. In this paper, we explore the performance and energy impact of several common code refactorings in Android apps. Experimental results indicate that some code smell refactorings positively impact the energy consumption of Android apps. Refactoring of the code smells "Duplicated code" and "Type checking" reduce energy consumption by up to 10.8%. Significant reduction in energy consumption, however, does not seem to be directly related to the increase or decrease of execution time. In addition, the energy impact over permutations of code smell refactorings in the selected Android apps was small. When analyzing the order in which refactorings were made across code smell types, it turned out that some permutations resulted in a reduction and some in an increase of energy consumption for the analyzed apps. More research needs to be done to investigate how factors like size and age of software apps, experience, and number of contributors to app development correlate with (a) the number and type of code smells found and (b) the impact of energy consumption and performance after refactoring.</p></details> |  |

However, with the growing interest and inherent difficulty in repository-level code generation, most existing code generation studies focus on improving the correctness of generated code while overlooking the inference efficiency, which is substantially affected by the overhead during LLM generation. Although there has been work on accelerating LLM inference, these approaches are not tailored to the specific characteristics of code generation; instead, they treat code the same as natural language sequences and ignore its unique syntax and semantic characteristics, which are also crucial for improving efficiency. Consequently, these approaches exhibit limited effectiveness in code generation tasks, particularly for repository-level scenarios with considerable complexity and difficulty. To alleviate this issue, following draft-verification paradigm, we propose FastCoder, a simple yet highly efficient inference acceleration approach specifically designed for code generation, without compromising the quality of the output. FastCoder constructs a multi-source datastore, providing access to both general and project-specific knowledge, facilitating the retrieval of high-quality draft sequences. Moreover, FastCoder reduces the retrieval cost by controlling retrieval timing, and enhances efficiency through parallel retrieval and a context- and LLM preference-aware cache. Experimental results show that FastCoder can reach up to 2.53x and 2.54x speedup compared to autoregressive decoding in repository-level and standalone code generation tasks, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art inference acceleration approaches by up to 88%. FastCoder can also be integrated with existing correctness-focused code generation approaches to accelerate the LLM generation process, and reach a speedup exceeding 2.6x.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE 2025 |

We develop and validate a dual-signal quality assessment framework that combines model confidence with inter-model consensus (external entropy) and evaluate it across legal reasoning (390 Supreme Court cases), political analysis (645 hyperpartisan articles), and medical classification (1,000 clinical transcripts). External entropy is consistently negatively associated with accuracy (r = -0.179 to -0.273, p < 0.001), while confidence is positively associated in two domains (r = 0.104 to 0.429). Weight optimization improves over single-signal baselines by 6.6-113.7% and transfers across domains (100% success), and an intelligent triage protocol reduces manual verification effort by 44.6% while maintaining quality. The framework offers a principled, domain-agnostic quality assurance mechanism that scales qualitative coding without extensive double-coding, provides actionable guidance for sampling and verification, and enables larger and more diverse corpora to be analyzed with maintained rigor.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables. v2: revised abstract and JCSS-aligned prose; unified table formatting and naming; clean compile</p></details> |

However, the inherent complexity of code editing tasks forces existing approaches to rely on LLMs' autoregressive end-to-end generation, where decoding speed plays a critical role in efficiency. While inference acceleration techniques like speculative decoding are applied to improve the decoding efficiency, these methods fail to account for the unique characteristics of code editing tasks where changes are typically localized and existing code segments are reused. To address this limitation, we propose EfficientEdit, a novel method that improves LLM-based code editing efficiency through two key mechanisms based on speculative decoding: (1) effective reuse of original code segments while identifying potential edit locations, and (2) efficient generate edit content via high-quality drafts from edit-oriented draft models and a dynamic verification mechanism that balances quality and acceleration. Experimental results show that EfficientEdit can achieve up to 10.38$\times$ and 13.09$\times$ speedup compared to standard autoregressive decoding in CanItEdit and CodeIF-Bench, respectively, outperforming state-of-the-art inference acceleration approaches by up to 90.6%.

Current code agent designs frequently depend on complex, hand-crafted workflows and tool sets. However, this reliance on elaborate scaffolding presents several challenges: agent performance becomes overly dependent on prompt tuning and custom design choices, heavy human intervention obscures a model's true underlying capabilities, and intricate pipelines are costly to build and maintain. Furthermore, optimizing complex task prompts increases the risk of data leakage. Currently, when introducing new models, LLM providers like OpenAI and Anthropic often publish benchmark scores to demonstrate their models' coding proficiency, but keep their proprietary evaluation frameworks confidential. To address these limitations, we introduce Lita (Lite Agent), which operationalizes liteness, a principle of minimizing manual design while retaining the essential elements of a fully autonomous agent. Lita enables a more faithful and unified evaluation without elaborate scaffolding. Experiments on the Aider Polyglot and SWE-Bench with frontier models demonstrate that Lita achieves competitive or superior performance compared to workflow-based and agentic baselines. Crucially, Lita also consumes fewer tokens and requires significantly less design effort. Our results suggest that Lita is sufficient to reveal the underlying coding competence of modern LLMs. Finally, we propose the Agent Complexity Law: the performance gap between agents of varying complexity, from simple to sophisticated designs, will shrink as the core model improves, ultimately converging to a negligible difference.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Preference-Driven Methodology for High-Quality Solidity Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03006v3)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable progress in generating functionally correct Solidity code, they continue to face critical challenges in producing gas-efficient and secure code, which are critical requirements for real-world smart contract deployment. Although recent advances leverage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) for code preference alignment, existing approaches treat functional correctness, gas optimization, and security as independent objectives, resulting in contracts that may achieve operational soundness but suffer from prohibitive execution costs or dangerous vulnerabilities. To address these limitations, we propose PrefGen, a novel framework that extends standard DPO beyond human preferences to incorporate quantifiable blockchain-specific metrics, enabling holistic multi-objective optimization specifically tailored for smart contract generation. Our framework introduces a comprehensive evaluation methodology with four complementary metrics: Pass@k (functional correctness), Compile@k (syntactic correctness), Gas@k (gas efficiency), and Secure@k (security assessment), providing rigorous multi-dimensional contract evaluation. Through extensive experimentation, we demonstrate that PrefGen significantly outperforms existing approaches across all critical dimensions, achieving 66.7% Pass@5, 58.9% Gas@5, and 62.5% Secure@5, while generating production-ready smart contracts that are functionally correct, cost-efficient, and secure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Long-Horizon Visual Imitation Learning via Plan and Code Reflection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05368v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from long-horizon demonstrations with complex action sequences presents significant challenges for visual imitation learning, particularly in understanding temporal relationships of actions and spatial relationships between objects. In this paper, we propose a new agent framework that incorporates two dedicated reflection modules to enhance both plan and code generation. The plan generation module produces an initial action sequence, which is then verified by the plan reflection module to ensure temporal coherence and spatial alignment with the demonstration video. The code generation module translates the plan into executable code, while the code reflection module verifies and refines the generated code to ensure correctness and consistency with the generated plan. These two reflection modules jointly enable the agent to detect and correct errors in both the plan generation and code generation, improving performance in tasks with intricate temporal and spatial dependencies. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce LongVILBench, a benchmark comprising 300 human demonstrations with action sequences of up to 18 steps. LongVILBench emphasizes temporal and spatial complexity across multiple task types. Experimental results demonstrate that existing methods perform poorly on this benchmark, whereas our new framework establishes a strong baseline for long-horizon visual imitation learning.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Despite its importance, CAD modeling remains largely a time-intensive, manual task. Recent works have attempted to automate this process with small transformer-based models and handcrafted CAD sequence representations. However, there has been little effort to leverage the potential of large language models (LLMs) for sequential CAD design. In this work, we introduce a new large-scale dataset of more than 170k CAD models annotated with high-quality, human-like descriptions generated with our pipeline based on GPT-4.1. Using this dataset, we fine-tune powerful code-LLMs to generate CAD sequences represented in a JSON-based format from natural language descriptions, demonstrating the viability and effectiveness of this approach for text-conditioned CAD generation. Because simple metrics often fail to reflect the quality of generated objects, we introduce geometric and topological metrics based on sphericity, mean curvature, and Euler characteristic to provide richer structural insights. Our experiments and ablation studies on both synthetic and human-annotated data demonstrate that CADmium is able to automate CAD design, drastically speeding up the design of new objects. The dataset, code, and fine-tuned models are available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[TENET: Leveraging Tests Beyond Validation for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24148v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a widely adopted software engineering practice that requires developers to create and execute tests alongside code implementation, ensuring that software behavior is continuously validated and refined. In the era of vibe coding, where developers increasingly delegate code writing to large language models (LLMs) by specifying high-level intentions, TDD becomes even more crucial, as test cases serve as executable specifications that explicitly define and verify intended functionality beyond what natural-language descriptions and code context can convey. While vibe coding under TDD is promising, there are three main challenges: (1) selecting a small yet effective test suite to improve the generation accuracy and control the execution workload, (2) retrieving context such as relevant code effectively, and (3) systematically using test feedback for effective code refinement. To address these challenges, we introduce TENET, an LLM agent for generating functions in complex real-world repositories under the TDD setting. TENET features three components: (1) a novel test harness mechanism that selects a concise test suite to maximize diversity of target usage scenarios; (2) a tailored agent toolset that performs efficient retrieval of relevant code with interactive debugging; and (3) a reflection-based refinement workflow that iteratively analyzes failures, replenishes context, and applies code refinement. TENET achieves 69.08% and 81.77% Pass@1 on RepoCod and RepoEval benchmarks, outperforming the best agentic baselines by 9.49 and 2.17 percentage points, respectively. In addition, this is the first study of test-driven code generation with repository-level context, examining how different aspects of test suites affect the performance of LLM agents under the TDD setting.</p></details> |  |

Distinct from previous code generation techniques, code generation agents are characterized by three core features. 1) Autonomy: the ability to independently manage the entire workflow, from task decomposition to coding and debugging. 2) Expanded task scope: capabilities that extend beyond generating code snippets to encompass the full software development lifecycle (SDLC). 3) Enhancement of engineering practicality: a shift in research emphasis from algorithmic innovation toward practical engineering challenges, such as system reliability, process management, and tool integration. This domain has recently witnessed rapid development and an explosion in research, demonstrating significant application potential. This paper presents a systematic survey of the field of LLM-based code generation agents. We trace the technology's developmental trajectory from its inception and systematically categorize its core techniques, including both single-agent and multi-agent architectures. Furthermore, this survey details the applications of LLM-based agents across the full SDLC, summarizes mainstream evaluation benchmarks and metrics, and catalogs representative tools. Finally, by analyzing the primary challenges, we identify and propose several foundational, long-term research directions for the future work of the field.</p></details> | <details><summary>Work ...</summary><p>Work in progress (V2)</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose a novel technique to expand the code and index for predicting the required APIs, directly enabling high-quality, end-to-end code generation for auto-completion and agentic AI applications. We address the problem of API leaks in current code-to-code benchmark datasets by introducing a new dataset built from real-world ServiceNow Script Includes that capture the challenge of unclear API usage intent in the code. Our evaluation metrics show that this method achieves 87.86% top-40 retrieval accuracy, allowing the critical context with APIs needed for successful downstream code generation. To enable real-time predictions, we develop a comprehensive post-training pipeline that optimizes a compact 0.6B reranker through synthetic dataset generation, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning. This approach enables our compact reranker to outperform a much larger 8B model while maintaining 2.5x reduced latency, effectively addressing the nuances of enterprise-specific code without the computational overhead of larger models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Retri...</summary><p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation, API Prediction, Context-Aware Code Generation, Enterprise Code Completion, Reinforcement Learning, ServiceNow, Real-Time Code Search, Query Enhancement, Fine-Tuning, Embedding, Reranker</p></details> |

However, it still encounters various challenging obstacles that need to be solved before real-world deployment. One of which is the lack of standardization across different directions, resulting in variations in interpretation and objectives. In the survey, we provide detailed explanations of three leading directions in semantic communications, namely Theory of Mind, Generative AI, Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding. These directions have been widely studied, developed, and verified by institutes worldwide, and their effectiveness has increased along with the advancement in technology. We first introduce the concepts and background of these directions in the survey. Firstly, the survey introduces the Theory of Mind, where the communication agents interact with each other, gaining understanding from observations and slowly forming a common language. Secondly, we present generative AI models, which can create new content and offer more freedom to interpret the data beyond the limitation of semantic meaning compression of raw data before transmitting it. Thirdly, our survey reviews deep learning models to jointly optimize the source and channel coding modules. Then, we present a comprehensive survey of existing works in each direction, thereby offering readers an overview of past achievements and potential avenues for further contribution. Moreover, for each direction, the survey identifies and discusses the existing challenges that must be addressed before these approaches can be effectively deployed in real-world scenarios. These challenges encompass a range of technical, computational, and practical issues in the survey. Finally, this survey also explores emerging trends such as specifically quantum computing, in semantic communication is discussed in this survey.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 9 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |

If a code and its dual code are both AMDS, then the code is said to be near maximum distance separable (NMDS). For $k=3$ and $k=4$, there are many constructions of NMDS codes by adding some suitable projective points to arcs in $\mathrm{PG}(k-1,q)$. In this paper, we consider the monomial equivalence problem for some NMDS codes with the same weight distributions and present new constructions of NMDS codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-Powered Code Analysis and Optimization for Gaussian Splatting Kernels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25626v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian splatting (3DGS) is a transformative technique with profound implications on novel view synthesis and real-time rendering. Given its importance, there have been many attempts to improve its performance. However, with the increasing complexity of GPU architectures and the vast search space of performance-tuning parameters, it is a challenging task. Although manual optimizations have achieved remarkable speedups, they require domain expertise and the optimization process can be highly time consuming and error prone. In this paper, we propose to exploit large language models (LLMs) to analyze and optimize Gaussian splatting kernels. To our knowledge, this is the first work to use LLMs to optimize highly specialized real-world GPU kernels. We reveal the intricacies of using LLMs for code optimization and analyze the code optimization techniques from the LLMs. We also propose ways to collaborate with LLMs to further leverage their capabilities. For the original 3DGS code on the MipNeRF360 datasets, LLMs achieve significant speedups, 19% with Deepseek and 24% with GPT-5, demonstrating the different capabilities of different LLMs. By feeding additional information from performance profilers, the performance improvement from LLM-optimized code is enhanced to up to 42% and 38% on average. In comparison, our best-effort manually optimized version can achieve a performance improvement up to 48% and 39% on average, showing that there are still optimizations beyond the capabilities of current LLMs. On the other hand, even upon a newly proposed 3DGS framework with algorithmic optimizations, Seele, LLMs can still further enhance its performance by 6%, showing that there are optimization opportunities missed by domain experts. This highlights the potential of collaboration between domain experts and LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memorize or Generalize? Evaluating LLM Code Generation with Code Rewriting](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02296v2)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated exceptional code generation capabilities. However, there is a growing debate whether LLMs are mostly doing memorization (i.e., replicating or reusing large parts of their training data) versus generalization (i.e., beyond training data). Existing evaluations largely proxy memorization with surface/structural similarity, thereby conflating benign reuse of repeated code with harmful recall and neglecting task correctness under semantic variation. We define harmful memorization behaviorally as failure at high similarity and introduce a semantic perturbation code rewriting, which rewrites a semantically different answer at a similar difficulty level for a given coding task, then reverse-engineers a novel coding task. We further propose Memorization Risk Index (MRI), a normalized score that combines two signals: (i) how similar the model's answer for the rewritten task is to the original ground-truth solution, and (ii) how much performance drops from the original task to its rewritten counterpart. MRI is high only when both conditions hold -- when the model outputs similar code but fails the perturbed task -- thereby capturing harmful memorization rather than benign reuse of repeated code. Empirical evaluations on code generation benchmarks MBPP+ and BigCodeBench reveal that (1) memorization does not increase with larger models and in many cases alleviates as they scale; (2) supervised fine-tuning (SFT) improves accuracy while introduces memorization; (3) reinforcement learning with proximal policy optimization (PPO) achieves a more balanced trade-off between memorization and generalization.</p></details> |  |

The framework incorporates several key innovations: a decoding information aggregation model that employs a convolutional neural network to refine bit reliability estimates for OSD using the soft-output trajectory of the NMS decoder; an adaptive decoding path for OSD, initialized by the arranged list of the most a priori likely tests algorithm and dynamically updated with empirical data; and a sliding window assisted model that enables early termination of test error patterns' traversal, curbing complexity with minimal performance loss. For short high-rate codes, a dedicated undetected error detector identifies erroneous NMS outcomes that satisfy parity checks, ensuring they are forwarded to OSD for correction. Extensive simulations on LDPC, BCH, and RS codes demonstrate that the proposed hybrid decoder delivers a competitive trade-off, achieving near-ML frame error rate performance while maintaining advantages in throughput, latency, and complexity over state-of-the-art alternatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Modeling Others' Minds as Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01272v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate prediction of human behavior is essential for robust and safe human-AI collaboration. However, existing approaches for modeling people are often data-hungry and brittle because they either make unrealistic assumptions about rationality or are too computationally demanding to adapt rapidly. Our key insight is that many everyday social interactions may follow predictable patterns; efficient "scripts" that minimize cognitive load for actors and observers, e.g., "wait for the green light, then go." We propose modeling these routines as behavioral programs instantiated in computer code rather than policies conditioned on beliefs and desires. We introduce ROTE, a novel algorithm that leverages both large language models (LLMs) for synthesizing a hypothesis space of behavioral programs, and probabilistic inference for reasoning about uncertainty over that space. We test ROTE in a suite of gridworld tasks and a large-scale embodied household simulator. ROTE predicts human and AI behaviors from sparse observations, outperforming competitive baselines -- including behavior cloning and LLM-based methods -- by as much as 50% in terms of in-sample accuracy and out-of-sample generalization. By treating action understanding as a program synthesis problem, ROTE opens a path for AI systems to efficiently and effectively predict human behavior in the real-world.</p></details> |  |
| **[Black-Box Crypto is Useless for Pseudorandom Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01854v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A pseudorandom code is a keyed error-correction scheme with the property that any polynomial number of encodings appear random to any computationally bounded adversary. We show that the pseudorandomness of any code tolerating a constant rate of random errors cannot be based on black-box reductions to almost any generic cryptographic primitive: for instance, anything that can be built from random oracles, generic multilinear groups, and virtual black-box obfuscation. Our result is optimal, as Ghentiyala and Guruswami (2024) observed that pseudorandom codes tolerating any sub-constant rate of random errors exist using a black-box reduction from one-way functions. The key technical ingredient in our proof is the hypercontractivity theorem for Boolean functions, which we use to prove our impossibility in the random oracle model. It turns out that this easily extends to an impossibility in the presence of ``crypto oracles,'' a notion recently introduced -- and shown to be capable of implementing all the primitives mentioned above -- by Lin, Mook, and Wichs (EUROCRYPT 2025).</p></details> |  |

We present R1-Code-Interpreter, an extension of a text-only LLM trained via multi-turn supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to autonomously generate multiple code queries during step-by-step reasoning. Unlike prior RL + tool-use efforts focused on narrow domains such as math or retrieval, we curate 144 diverse reasoning and planning tasks and show that training a general-purpose Code Interpreter across them presents significant challenges due to task heterogeneity and scarcity of effective samples. To address this, we introduce a multi-stage curriculum learning approach that partitions training samples by measured improvement potential. The RL training prioritizes samples with higher potential and gradually shifts to lower-potential ones, increasing the average RL gains from merely +3.4% to +9.3% across Qwen-2.5 models (3/7/14B). Our final model, R1-CI-14B, improves average accuracy on the 37 test tasks from 44.1% to 72.4%, outperforming text-only GPT-4o (58.6%) and GPT-4o with Code Interpreter (70.9%). Notably, R1-CI-14B also exhibits emergent self-checking behavior through code generation.

| **[Adapt or Regress: Rate-Memory-Compatible Spatially-Coupled Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21112v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatially-coupled (SC) codes are a class of low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes that have excellent performance thanks to the degrees of freedom they offer. An SC code is designed by partitioning a base matrix into components, the number of which implies the code memory, then coupling and lifting them. In the same system, various error-correction coding schemes are typically needed. For example, in wireless communication standards, several channel conditions and data rates should be supported. In storage and computing systems, stronger codes should be adopted as the device ages. Adaptive code design enables switching from one code to another when needed, ensuring reliability while reducing hardware cost. In this paper, we introduce a class of reconfigurable SC codes named rate-memory-compatible SC (RMC-SC) codes, which we design probabilistically. In particular, rate compatibility in RMC-SC codes is achieved via increasing the SC code memory, which also makes the codes memory-compatible and improves performance. We express the expected number of short cycles in the SC code protograph as a function of the fixed probability distribution characterizing the already-designed SC code as well as the unknown distribution characterizing the additional components. We use the gradient-descent algorithm to find a locally-optimal distribution, in terms of cycle count, for the new components. The method can be recursively used to design any number of SC codes needed, and we show how to extend it to other cases. Next, we perform the finite-length optimization using a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MC$^2$) approach that we update to design the proposed RMC-SC codes. Experimental results demonstrate significant reductions in cycle counts and remarkable performance gains achieved by RMC-SC codes compared with a literature-based straightforward scheme.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages (double column), 4 figures, submitted to the IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC)</p></details> |

By combining nominal techniques for handling variable binding with support for variadic expressions (common in abstract syntax trees and programming languages), the approach addresses key challenges such as overemphasis on bound variable names and difficulty handling insertions or deletions in code fragments. The algorithm distinguishes between atoms and two kinds of variables (term and hedge variables) to compute best generalizations that maximally preserve structural similarities while abstracting systematic differences. It also provides detailed information to reconstruct original expressions and quantify structural differences. This information can be useful in tasks like code clone detection, refactoring, and program analysis. By introducing a parametrizable rigidity function, the technique offers fine-grained control over similarity criteria and reduces nondeterminism, enabling flexible adaptation to practical scenarios where trivial similarities should be discounted. Although demonstrated primarily in the context of code similarity detection, this framework is broadly applicable wherever precise comparison of variadic and binder-rich representations is required.</p></details> |  |

This paper identifies the root cause and provides a principled solution. We uncover that the canonical state-based formulation of PC (sPC) is, by design, deeply inefficient on digital hardware, due to an inherent signal decay problem that scales exponentially with depth. To address this fundamental limitation, we introduce a novel reparameterization of PC, named error-based PC (ePC), which does not suffer from signal decay. By optimizing over prediction errors rather than states, ePC enables signals to reach all layers simultaneously and unattenuated, converging orders of magnitude faster than sPC. Experiments across multiple architectures and datasets demonstrate that ePC matches backpropagation's performance even for deeper models where sPC struggles. Besides practical improvements, our work provides theoretical insight into PC dynamics and establishes a foundation for scaling bio-inspired learning to deeper architectures on digital hardware and beyond.</p></details> | <details><summary>Name ...</summary><p>Name change (Error Optimization => ePC) to reflect that ePC is indeed still PC, not a separate algorithm.

This progress is bottlenecked by a critical evaluation gap: established benchmarks focus on algorithmic correctness and are blind to the visual fidelity and interactive integrity that define modern user experiences. To bridge this gap, we introduce ArtifactsBench, a new benchmark and paradigm for the automated, multimodal evaluation of visual code generation. Our framework programmatically renders each generated artifact and captures its dynamic behavior through temporal screenshots. This visual evidence, alongside the source code, is then assessed by a Multimodal LLM (MLLM)-as-Judge, which is rigorously guided by a fine-grained, per-task checklist to ensure holistic and reproducible scoring. We construct a new benchmark of 1,825 diverse tasks and evaluate over 30 leading LLMs. Our automated evaluation achieves a striking 94.4% ranking consistency with WebDev Arena, the gold-standard for human preference in web development, and over 90% pairwise agreement with human experts. This establishes ArtifactsBench as the first framework to reliably automate the assessment of human-perceived quality at scale. Our analysis provides a high-resolution map of the current SOTA, revealing that generalist models often outperform domain-specific ones. We open-source ArtifactsBench, including the benchmark, evaluation harness, and baseline results at https://artifactsbenchmark.github.io/, to provide the community with a scalable and accurate tool to accelerate the development of user-centric generative models.</p></details> |  |

While previous research has shown that LLMs have the capability to generate both secure and insecure code, the literature does not take into account what factors help generate secure and effective code. Therefore in this paper we focus on identifying and understanding the conditions and contexts in which LLMs can be effectively and safely deployed in real-world scenarios to generate quality code. We conducted a comparative analysis of four advanced LLMs--GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 using ChatGPT and Bard and Gemini from Google--using 9 separate tasks to assess each model's code generation capabilities. We contextualized our study to represent the typical use cases of a real-life developer employing LLMs for everyday tasks as work. Additionally, we place an emphasis on security awareness which is represented through the use of two distinct versions of our developer persona. In total, we collected 61 code outputs and analyzed them across several aspects: functionality, security, performance, complexity, and reliability. These insights are crucial for understanding the models' capabilities and limitations, guiding future development and practical applications in the field of automated code generation.</p></details> | 12 pages, 2 figures |

In this work, we introduce a hierarchical framework that leverages code-generating vision-language models (VLMs) in combination with low-level diffusion policies to effectively imitate and generalize robotic behavior. Our key insight is to treat open-source robotic APIs not only as execution interfaces but also as sources of structured supervision: the associated subtask functions - when exposed - can serve as modular, semantically meaningful labels. We train a VLM to decompose task descriptions into executable subroutines, which are then grounded through a diffusion policy trained to imitate the corresponding robot behavior. To handle the non-Markovian nature of both code execution and certain real-world tasks, such as object swapping, our architecture incorporates a memory mechanism that maintains subtask context across time. We find that this design enables interpretable policy decomposition, improves generalization when compared to flat policies and enables separate evaluation of high-level planning and low-level control.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages including references, 6 figures.

By focusing on a well-defined family of functions, function-correcting codes can be constructed with minimal length while still ensuring full error detection and correction within that family. In this work, we explore the concept of locally $(\lambda,\rho)$-functions for $b$-symbol read channels and investigate the optimal redundancy of the corresponding function-correcting $b$-symbol codes (FCBSC) by introducing the notions of locally $(\lambda,\rho,b)$-functions. First, we discuss the values of $\lambda$ and $\rho$ for which a function can be considered as a locally $(\lambda,\rho)$-function in $b$-symbol metric. The findings improve some known results in the Hamming metric and present several new results in the $b$-symbol metric. Then we investigate the optimal redundancy of $(f,t)$-FCBSCs for locally $(\lambda,\rho,b)$-functions. We establish a recurrence relation between the optimal redundancy of $(f,t)$-function-correcting codes for the $(b+1)$-symbol read and $b$-symbol read channels. We present an upper bound on the optimal redundancy of $(f,t)$-function-correcting $b$-symbol codes for general locally ($\lambda,\rho$, $b$)-functions by associating it to the minimum achievable length of $b$-symbol error-correcting codes and traditional Hamming-metric codes, given a fixed number of codewords and a specified minimum distance. We derive some explicit upper bounds on the redundancy of $(f,t)$-function-correcting $b$-symbol codes for locally $(\lambda,2t,b)$-functions. Moreover, for the case where $b=1$, we show that a locally ($3,2t,1$)-function achieves the optimal redundancy of $3t$. Additionally, we explicitly investigate the locality and optimal redundancy of FCBSCs for the $b$-symbol weight function and weight distribution function for $b\geq1$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Developer Instructions and Code Completion Through Instruction-Aware Fill-in-the-Middle Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24637v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced code completion, yet they often fail when the developer's intent is underspecified in the code context. To address this, developers usually add natural language instructions (e.g., comments) into the code context to clarify their intent. However, existing code LLMs applied for code completion systems merely undergo a fill-in-the-middle (FIM) pre-training, which struggles to leverage this information effectively due to the lack of instruction-like training data. Existing instruction-tuning techniques, which improve instruction-following in general code generation, paradoxically degrade FIM performance, forcing a trade-off between instruction-following and infilling capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce Instruction-aware Fill-in-the-Middle (IFIM), an instruction-tuning method specifically designed to enhance FIM code completion models. IFIM extends the conventional FIM training objective by incorporating an explicit instruction section into the input, enabling the model to learn from (prefix, instruction, suffix) triplets. This approach allows the model to effectively leverage developer-provided directives while preserving its core completion abilities when no instructions are present. To facilitate this, we constructed a large-scale dataset by using GPT-4o to generate concise, intent-focused instructions for code infilling examples. We evaluated IFIM by applying it to two popular base models, Deepseek-Coder and Qwen2.5-Coder, on the benchmarks derived from HumanEval-infilling and RepoMasterEval. The results demonstrate that IFIM significantly improves instruction-following capabilities, boosting the Pass@1 score from 84.6% to 93.6% on HumanEval-infilling. Moreover, this enhancement does not compromise the models' original performance on FIM code completion tasks with no instructions provided.</p></details> | 10 pages |

In this paper, we introduce HiKE: the Hierarchical Korean-English code-switching benchmark, the first globally accessible evaluation framework for Korean-English CS, aiming to provide a means for the precise evaluation of multilingual ASR models and to foster research in the field. The proposed framework not only consists of high-quality, natural CS data across various topics, but also provides meticulous loanword labels and a hierarchical CS-level labeling scheme (word, phrase, and sentence) that together enable a systematic evaluation of a model's ability to handle each distinct level of code-switching. Through evaluations of diverse multilingual ASR models and fine-tuning experiments, this paper demonstrates that while most multilingual ASR models initially struggle with CS-ASR, this capability can be enabled through fine-tuning with CS data.

These patterns are fundamental to musical structure and reflect the cognitive processes involved in composition. However, extracting these patterns remains challenging because of the inherent semantic ambiguity in musical interpretation. We formulate the task of music-word discovery as a statistical optimization problem and propose a two-stage Expectation-Maximization (EM)-based learning framework: 1. Developing a music-word dictionary; 2. Reconstructing the music data. When evaluated against human expert annotations, the algorithm achieved an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.61. Our findings indicate that minimizing code length effectively addresses semantic ambiguity, suggesting that human optimization of encoding systems shapes musical semantics. This approach enables computers to extract ``basic building blocks'' from music data, facilitating structural analysis and sparse encoding. The method has two primary applications. First, in AI music, it supports downstream tasks such as music generation, classification, style transfer, and improvisation. Second, in musicology, it provides a tool for analyzing compositional patterns and offers insights into the principle of minimal encoding across diverse musical styles and composers.</p></details> |  |

The prevalence of problematic papers undermines the reliability of scientific research and threatens the foundation of evidence-based medicine. In this study,we focus on the field of non-coding RNA(ncRNA) as a case study to explore the typical characteristics of problematic papers from various perspectives, aiming to provide insights for addressing large-scale fraudulent publications. Research on under-investigated ncRNAs is more likely to yield problematic papers. These problematic papers often exhibit significant textual similarity, and many others sharing this similarity also display suspicious instances of image duplication. Healthcare institutions are particularly prone to publishing problematic papers, especially those with a low publication volume. Most problematic papers are found in a limited number of journals, and many journals inadequately address the commented papers. Our findings suggest that numerous problematic papers may still remain unidentified. The revealed characteristics offer valuable insights for formulating strategies to address the issue of fraudulent papers at scale.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 6 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Post-hoc repair pipelines detect such faults only after execution, incurring latency, relying on incomplete test suites, and often mis-localizing the defect. Since semantic drift originates in the autoregressive decoding process, intervening while the code is being generated is a direct way to stop error propagation. Constrained-decoding approaches such as ROCODE attempt this, but still wait until the entire program runs to obtain feedback and use entropy heuristics that do not truly capture semantics. A more effective solution must inject semantic signals-early and precisely-into the decoding process.We present SemGuard, a semantic-evaluator-driven framework that performs real-time, line-level semantic supervision. To train the evaluator, we build SemDiff, the first dataset with fine-grained annotations that mark the exact line where a correct and an incorrect implementation diverge. The evaluator, once embedded in the LLM's decoder, flags deviations on partial code, rolls back to the faulty line, and guides regeneration-without executing the program or requiring test cases. Across four benchmarks, SemGuard consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines. It lowers the semantic error rate by 19.86% on SemDiff relative to ROCODE, and lifts Pass@1 by 48.92% on the real-world LiveCodeBench with CodeLlama-7B. Similar gains hold for StarCoder2-7B on MBPP and for DeepSeekCoder-6.7B on the Java benchmark SemDiff-Java, demonstrating model- and language-agnostic effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 40th IEEE/ACM Automated Software Engineering Conference (ASE 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Toward Causal-Visual Programming: Enhancing Agentic Reasoning in Low-Code Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25282v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 table |

Introducing notions of weight and defect relative to an F_q-subspace, we analyze the sequence of maximum non-zero defects. We establish a correspondence between subspaces of positive defect and their Delsarte duals, enabling explicit characterizations of the associated sequences of maximum non-zero defects. Our framework unifies several classes of subspaces studied in finite geometry and connects them to linear rank-metric codes by providing a new geometric interpretation of code duality. Building on these results, we characterize classes of rank-metric codes closed under duality, including MRD, near MRD, quasi-MRD, and a new family of (n, k)-MRD codes. Finally, we explore applications to q-matroids, by studying the problem of F_{q^m}-representability for direct sums of uniform q-matroids and describing their rank generating functions.</p></details> |  |
| **[MaintainCoder: Maintainable Code Generation Under Dynamic Requirements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.24260v3)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern code generation has made significant strides in functional correctness and execution efficiency. However, these systems often overlook a critical dimension in real-world software development: maintainability. To handle dynamic requirements with minimal rework, we propose MaintainCoder as a pioneering solution. It integrates the Waterfall model, design patterns, and multi-agent collaboration to systematically enhance cohesion, reduce coupling, achieving clear responsibility boundaries and better maintainability. We also introduce MaintainCoder, a benchmark comprising requirement changes and novel dynamic metrics on maintenance efforts. Experiments demonstrate that existing code generation methods struggle to meet maintainability standards when requirements evolve. In contrast, MaintainCoder improves dynamic maintainability metrics by more than 60% with even higher correctness of initial codes. Furthermore, while static metrics fail to accurately reflect maintainability and even contradict each other, our proposed dynamic metrics exhibit high consistency. Our work not only provides the foundation for maintainable code generation, but also highlights the need for more realistic and comprehensive code generation research.

| **[Adaptive Source-Channel Coding for Multi-User Semantic and Data Communications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24247v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers a multi-user semantic and data communication (MU-SemDaCom) system, where a base station (BS) simultaneously serves users with different semantic and data tasks through a downlink multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) channel. The coexistence of heterogeneous communication tasks, diverse channel conditions, and the requirements for digital compatibility poses significant challenges to the efficient design of MU-SemDaCom systems. To address these issues, we propose a multi-user adaptive source-channel coding (MU-ASCC) framework that adaptively optimizes deep neural network (DNN)-based source coding, digital channel coding, and superposition broadcasting. First, we employ a data-regression method to approximate the end-to-end (E2E) semantic and data distortions, for which no closed-form expressions exist. The obtained logistic formulas decompose the E2E distortion as the addition of the source and channel distortion terms, in which the logistic parameter variations are task-dependent and jointly determined by both the DNN and channel parameters. Then, based on the derived formulas, we formulate a weighted-sum E2E distortion minimization problem that jointly optimizes the source-channel coding rates, power allocation, and beamforming vectors for both the data and semantic users. Finally, an alternating optimization (AO) framework is developed, where the adaptive rate optimization is solved using the subgradient descent method, while the joint power and beamforming is addressed via the uplink-downlink duality (UDD) technique. Simulation results demonstrate that, compared with the conventional separate source-channel coding (SSCC) and deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) schemes that are designed for a single task, the proposed MU-ASCC scheme achieves simultaneous improvements in both the data recovery and semantic task performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Takedown: How It's Done in Modern Coding Agent Exploits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24240v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coding agents, which are LLM-driven agents specialized in software development, have become increasingly prevalent in modern programming environments. Unlike traditional AI coding assistants, which offer simple code completion and suggestions, modern coding agents tackle more complex tasks with greater autonomy, such as generating entire programs from natural language instructions. To enable such capabilities, modern coding agents incorporate extensive functionalities, which in turn raise significant concerns over their security and privacy. Despite their growing adoption, systematic and in-depth security analysis of these agents has largely been overlooked. In this paper, we present a comprehensive security analysis of eight real-world coding agents. Our analysis addresses the limitations of prior approaches, which were often fragmented and ad hoc, by systematically examining the internal workflows of coding agents and identifying security threats across their components. Through the analysis, we identify 15 security issues, including previously overlooked or missed issues, that can be abused to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of user systems. Furthermore, we show that these security issues are not merely individual vulnerabilities, but can collectively lead to end-to-end exploitations. By leveraging these security issues, we successfully achieved arbitrary command execution in five agents and global data exfiltration in four agents, all without any user interaction or approval. Our findings highlight the need for a comprehensive security analysis in modern LLM-driven agents and demonstrate how insufficient security considerations can lead to severe vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Capacity-Achieving Codes for Noisy Insertion Channels](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24161v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>DNA storage has emerged as a promising solution for large-scale and long-term data preservation. Among various error types, insertions are the most frequent errors occurring in DNA sequences, where the inserted symbol is often identical or complementary to the original, and in practical implementations, noise can further cause the inserted symbol to mutate into a random one, which creates significant challenges to reliable data recovery. In this paper, we investigate a new noisy insertion channel, where infinitely many insertions of symbols complement or identical to the original ones and up to one insertion of random symbol may occur. We determine the coding capacity of the noisy channel and construct asymptotically optimal error-correcting codes achieving the coding capacity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memory Transfer Planning: LLM-driven Context-Aware Code Adaptation for Robot Manipulation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24160v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly explored in robot manipulation, but many existing methods struggle to adapt to new environments. Many systems require either environment-specific policy training or depend on fixed prompts and single-shot code generation, leading to limited transferability and manual re-tuning. We introduce Memory Transfer Planning (MTP), a framework that leverages successful control-code examples from different environments as procedural knowledge, using them as in-context guidance for LLM-driven planning. Specifically, MTP (i) generates an initial plan and code using LLMs, (ii) retrieves relevant successful examples from a code memory, and (iii) contextually adapts the retrieved code to the target setting for re-planning without updating model parameters. We evaluate MTP on RLBench, CALVIN, and a physical robot, demonstrating effectiveness beyond simulation. Across these settings, MTP consistently improved success rate and adaptability compared with fixed-prompt code generation, naive retrieval, and memory-free re-planning. Furthermore, in hardware experiments, leveraging a memory constructed in simulation proved effective. MTP provides a practical approach that exploits procedural knowledge to realize robust LLM-based planning across diverse robotic manipulation scenarios, enhancing adaptability to novel environments and bridging simulation and real-world deployment.</p></details> |  |
| **[VisCoder: Fine-Tuning LLMs for Executable Python Visualization Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03930v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) often struggle with visualization tasks like plotting diagrams, charts, where success depends on both code correctness and visual semantics. Existing instruction-tuning datasets lack execution-grounded supervision and offer limited support for iterative code correction, resulting in fragile and unreliable plot generation. We present VisCode-200K, a large-scale instruction tuning dataset for Python-based visualization and self-correction. It contains over 200K examples from two sources: (1) validated plotting code from open-source repositories, paired with natural language instructions and rendered plots; and (2) 45K multi-turn correction dialogues from Code-Feedback, enabling models to revise faulty code using runtime feedback. We fine-tune Qwen2.5-Coder-Instruct on VisCode-200K to create VisCoder, and evaluate it on PandasPlotBench. VisCoder significantly outperforms strong open-source baselines and approaches the performance of proprietary models like GPT-4o-mini. We further adopt a self-debug evaluation protocol to assess iterative repair, demonstrating the benefits of feedback-driven learning for executable, visually accurate code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[MetaLint: Generalizable Idiomatic Code Quality Analysis through Instruction-Following and Easy-to-Hard Generalization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11687v2)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models, though successful in code generation, struggle with code quality analysis because they are limited by static training data and can't easily adapt to evolving best practices. We introduce MetaLint, an instruction-following framework that formulates code quality analysis as the task of detecting and fixing problematic semantic code fragments or code idioms based on high-level specifications. Unlike conventional approaches that train models on static code quality conventions, MetaLint employs instruction tuning on synthetic linter-generated data with dynamic conventions to support easy-to-hard generalization, enabling models to adapt to novel or complex code patterns without retraining. To evaluate this, we construct a benchmark of challenging idioms inspired by real-world coding standards such as Python Enhancement Proposals (PEPs) and assess whether MetaLint-trained models reason adaptively or simply memorize. Our results show that MetaLint training improves generalization to unseen idioms. Qwen3-4B attains a 70.37% F-score on a manually curated and challenging PEP idiom detection benchmark, achieving the highest recall (70.43%) among all evaluated models. For localization, it reaches 26.73%, which is a strong outcome for its 4B parameter size and comparable to larger state-of-the-art models such as o3-mini, highlighting its potential for future-proof code quality analysis. Furthermore, MetaLint training enables generalization in idiom detection across model families, model scales, synthetic data from diverse linters, and Java idioms, demonstrating the general applicability of our approach. We plan to release our code and data to enable reproducibility and further work.</p></details> |  |
| **[Maximal Achievable Service Rates of Codes and Connections to Combinatorial Designs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.16983v3)** | 2025-09-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the service-rate region (SRR) of distributed storage systems that employ linear codes. We focus on systems where each server stores one code symbol, and a user recovers a data symbol by accessing any of its recovery groups, subject to per-server capacity limits. The SRR--the convex polytope of simultaneously achievable request rates--captures system throughput and scalability. We first derive upper and lower bounds on the maximum request rate of each data object. These bounds hold for all linear codes and depend only on the number of parity checks orthogonal to a particular set of codeword coordinates associated with that object, i.e., the equations used in majority-logic decoding, and on code parameters. We then check the bound saturation for 1) all non-systematic codes whose SRRs are already known and 2) systematic codes. For the former, we prove the bounds are tight. For systematic codes, we show that the upper bound is achieved whenever the supports of minimum-weight dual codewords form a 2-design. As an application, we determine the exact per-object demand limits for binary Hamming codes. Our framework provides a new lens to address the SRR problem through combinatorial design theory.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared in Allerton 2025</p></details> |

While the unsafe keyword allows programmers to bypass these restrictions, it introduces significant risks. Various approaches for isolating unsafe code to protect safe Rust from vulnerabilities have been proposed, yet these methods provide only fixed isolation boundaries and do not accommodate expressive policies that require sandboxing both safe and unsafe code. This paper presents SandCell for flexible and lightweight isolation in Rust by leveraging existing syntactic boundaries. SandCell allows programmers to specify which components to sandbox with minimal annotation effort, enabling fine-grained control over isolation. The system also introduces novel techniques to minimize overhead when transferring data between sandboxes. Our evaluation demonstrates SandCell's effectiveness in preventing vulnerabilities across various Rust applications while maintaining reasonable performance overheads.</p></details> |  |

| **[Programming Distributed Collective Processes in the eXchange Calculus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11212v6)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent trends like the Internet of Things (IoT) suggest a vision of dense and multi-scale deployments of computing devices in nearly all kinds of environments. A prominent engineering challenge revolves around programming the collective adaptive behaviour of such computational ecosystems. This requires abstractions able to capture concepts like ensembles (dynamic groups of cooperating devices) and collective tasks (joint activities carried out by ensembles). In this work, we consider collections of devices interacting with neighbours and that execute in nearly-synchronised sense-compute-interact rounds, where the computation is given by a single program mapping sensing values and incoming messages to output and outcoming messages. To support programming whole computational collectives, we propose the abstraction of a distributed collective process, which can be used to define at once the ensemble formation logic and its collective task. We formalise the abstraction in the eXchange Calculus (XC), a core functional language based on neighbouring values (maps from neighbours to values) where state and interaction is handled through a single primitive, exchange, and provide a corresponding implementation in the FCPP language. Then, we exercise distributed collective processes using two case studies: multi-hop message propagation and distributed monitoring of spatial properties. Finally, we discuss the features of the abstraction and its suitability for different kinds of distributed computing applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[AlgoTune: Can Language Models Speed Up General-Purpose Numerical Programs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15887v3)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite progress in language model (LM) capabilities, evaluations have thus far focused on models' performance on tasks that humans have previously solved, including in programming (Jimenez et al., 2024) and mathematics (Glazer et al., 2024). We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science, physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 154 coding tasks collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent, AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models. AlgoTuner uses a simple, budgeted loop that edits code, compiles and runs it, profiles performance, verifies correctness on tests, and selects the fastest valid version. AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers, which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Speeding up Program Repair with Non-Autoregressive Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01825v1)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enlightened by the success of machine learning techniques in various application areas, recent years have witnessed a surge of research efforts on automatic program repair (APR) using machine learning techniques. Previous machine learning-based APR techniques essentially modified bugs in the autoregressive (AR) manner, which predicts future values based on past values. Due to the manner of token-by-token generation, the AR-based APR technique has a huge time delay. In particular, the delay of the APR model with a large number of parameters is more serious. To address the issue, we aim to apply the non-autoregressive (NAR) method to the APR task, which can output target code in a parallel manner to avoid huge repair delays. However, the naive use of the NAR manner for the APR task suffers from the issue of compromised patch quality. To effectively adapt the NAR manner for the APR task, we in this paper propose NARRepair, the first customized NAR code generation model for the APR task. The NARRepair model features three major novelties, including 1) the repair action predictor for alleviating the over-correction issue, 2) the inter-token dependency extractor for alleviating the issue of lacking inter-token dependency information, and 3) the two-stage decoder for alleviating the issue of lacking contextual information. We evaluated NARRepair on three widely used datasets in the APR community, and the results show that 1) compared to other APR techniques, the NARRepair model has the best performance within the limited repair time, and 2) compared to AR-based APR techniques, the repair speed of NARRepair has been increased by 1.4-6.4 times in the GPU environment. Overall, the results show that NARRepair has achieved state-of-the-art comprehensive performance in terms of repair speed and accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2406.16526</p></details> |

Given the computational hardness of determining the full core, our approach provides a tractable approximation by sampling extreme points through randomized linear problems (LPs).

Our results show that the method is scalable and achieves high accuracy in terms of core reconstruction.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Integer Programming for the Binarized Neural Network Verification Problem](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.01525v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binarized neural networks (BNNs) are feedforward neural networks with binary weights and activation functions. In the context of using a BNN for classification, the verification problem seeks to determine whether a small perturbation of a given input can lead it to be misclassified by the BNN, and the robustness of the BNN can be measured by solving the verification problem over multiple inputs. The BNN verification problem can be formulated as an integer programming (IP) problem. However, the natural IP formulation is often challenging to solve due to a large integrality gap induced by big-$M$ constraints. We present two techniques to improve the IP formulation. First, we introduce a new method for obtaining a linear objective for the multi-class setting. Second, we introduce a new technique for generating valid inequalities for the IP formulation that exploits the recursive structure of BNNs. We find that our techniques enable verifying BNNs against a higher range of input perturbation than existing IP approaches within a limited time.</p></details> |  |

While these tools can boost productivity and code quality, concerns remain about over-reliance and potential impacts on conceptual learning. Objective: To investigate how ChatGPT access affects code quality, conceptual understanding, task completion times, and student perceptions in a CS1 course. Methods: We conducted a counterbalanced, quasi-experimental study in which students alternated between ChatGPT and non-ChatGPT conditions across two programming assignments in C (functions and structures). We evaluated their code submissions using multidimensional rubrics, conceptual post-surveys, and task completion time. Results: Students who had access to ChatGPT produced significantly higher rubric scores for code quality and completed tasks in less time compared to those without access. However, gains in conceptual understanding were mixed, lower for the functions topic but higher for the structures topic. Students reported positive experiences with ChatGPT, citing its value for debugging and practice, while expressing concerns about accuracy and long-term skill development. Conclusions: ChatGPT can enhance code quality and efficiency for novice programmers, but may not uniformly improve conceptual understanding. Structured integration and complementary instructional strategies are recommended to foster independent problem-solving skills.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to SIGCITE'25</p></details> |
| **[Provably Optimal Quantum Circuits with Mixed-Integer Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00649v1)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a depth-aware optimization framework for quantum circuit compilation that unifies provable optimality with scalable heuristics. For exact synthesis of a target unitary, we formulate a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that linearly handles global-phase equivalence and uses explicit parallel scheduling variables to certify depth-optimal solutions for small-to-medium circuits. Domain-specific valid constraints, including identity ordering, commuting-gate pruning, short-sequence redundancy cuts, and Hermitian-conjugate linkages, significantly accelerate branch-and-bound, yielding speedups up to 43x on standard benchmarks. The framework supports hardware-aware objectives, enabling fault-tolerant (e.g. T-count) and NISQ-era (e.g. entangling gates) devices. For approximate synthesis, we propose 3 objectives: (i) exact, but non-convex, phase-invariant fidelity maximization; (ii) a linear surrogate that maximizes the real trace overlap, yielding a tight lower bound to fidelity; and (iii) a convex quadratic function that minimizes the circuit's Frobenius error. To scale beyond exact MILP, we propose a novel rolling-horizon optimization (RHO) that rolls primarily in time, caps the active-qubits, and enforces per-qubit closure while globally optimizing windowed segments. This preserves local context, reduces the Hilbert-space dimension, and enables iterative improvements without ancillas. On a 142-gate seed circuit, RHO yields 116 gates, an 18.3% reduction from the seed, while avoiding the trade-off between myopic passes and long run times. Empirically, our exact compilation framework achieves certified depth-optimal circuits on standard targets, high-fidelity Fibonacci-anyon weaves, and a 36% gate-count reduction on multi-body parity circuits. All methods are in the open-source QuantumCircuitOpt, providing a single framework that bridges exact certification and scalable synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Certifiably Optimal Estimation and Calibration in Robotics via Trace-Constrained Semi-Definite Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23656v2)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many nonconvex problems in robotics can be relaxed into convex formulations via Semi-Definite Programming (SDP) that can be solved to global optimality. The practical quality of these solutions, however, critically depends on rounding them to rank-1 matrices, a condition that can be challenging to achieve. In this work, we focus on trace-constrained SDPs (TCSDPs), where the decision variables are Positive Semi-Definite (PSD) matrices with fixed trace values. We show that the latter can be used to design a gradient-based refinement procedure that projects relaxed SDP solutions toward rank-1, low-cost candidates. We also provide fixed-trace SDP relaxations for common robotic quantities, such as rotations and translations, and a modular virtual robot abstraction that simplifies modeling across different problem settings. We demonstrate that our trace-constrained SDP framework can be applied to many robotics tasks, and we showcase its effectiveness through simulations in Perspective-n-Point (PnP) estimation, hand-eye calibration, and dual-robot system calibration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to American Control Conference (ACC) 2026</p></details> |
| **[EVALOOOP: A Self-Consistency-Centered Framework for Assessing Large Language Model Robustness in Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12185v4)** | 2025-10-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the programming robustness of large language models (LLMs) is paramount for ensuring their reliability in AI-based software development. However, adversarial attacks exhibit fundamental limitations that compromise fair robustness assessment: they demonstrate contradictory evaluation outcomes where different attack strategies tend to favor different models, and more critically, they operate solely through external perturbations, failing to capture the intrinsic stability essential for autonomous coding agents where subsequent inputs are endogenously generated by the model itself. We introduce EVALOOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluates robustness from a self-consistency perspective, leveraging the natural duality inherent in software engineering tasks (e.g., code generation and code summarization). EVALOOOP establishes a self-contained feedback loop where an LLM iteratively transforms between code and natural language until functional failure occurs, with robustness quantified by a novel Average Sustainable Loops (ASL) metric-the mean number of iterations maintaining functional correctness across benchmark tasks. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without relying on external attack configurations, providing a unified metric that reveals how effectively LLMs preserve semantic integrity through sustained self-referential transformations. We evaluate 96 popular LLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 685B parameters, on EVALOOOP equipped with the MBPP Plus benchmark, and found that EVALOOOP typically induces a 2.65%-47.62% absolute drop in pass@1 accuracy within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507, despite inferior initial code generation compared to OpenAI's o-series models and DeepSeek-V3, demonstrated the superior robustness (ASL score).</p></details> | 20 pages, 4 figures |

GDLNN combines a domain-specific programming language, called GDL, with neural networks. The main strength of GDLNN lies in its GDL layer, which generates expressive and interpretable graph representations. Since the graph representation is interpretable, existing model explanation techniques can be directly applied to explain GDLNN's predictions. Our evaluation shows that the GDL-based representation achieves high accuracy on most graph classification benchmark datasets, outperforming dominant graph learning methods such as GNNs. Applying an existing model explanation technique also yields high-quality explanations of GDLNN's predictions. Furthermore, the cost of GDLNN is low when the explanation cost is included.</p></details> |  |
| **[Which Programming Language and Model Work Best With LLM-as-a-Judge For Code Retrieval?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00324v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code search is an important information retrieval application. Benefits of better code search include faster new developer on-boarding, reduced software maintenance, and ease of understanding for large repositories. Despite improvements in search algorithms and search benchmarks, the domain of code search has lagged behind. One reason is the high cost of human annotation for code queries and answers. While humans may annotate search results in general text QA systems, code annotations require specialized knowledge of a programming language (PL), as well as domain specific software engineering knowledge. In this work we study the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) to retrieve code at the level of functions and to generate annotations for code search results. We compare the impact of the retriever representation (sparse vs. semantic), programming language, and LLM by comparing human annotations across several popular languages (C, Java, Javascript, Go, and Python). We focus on repositories that implement common data structures likely to be implemented in any PLs. For the same human annotations, we compare several LLM-as-a-Judge models to evaluate programming language and other affinities between LLMs. We find that the chosen retriever and PL exhibit affinities that can be leveraged to improve alignment of human and AI relevance determinations, with significant performance implications. We also find differences in representation (sparse vs. semantic) across PLs that impact alignment of human and AI relevance determinations. We propose using transpilers to bootstrap scalable code search benchmark datasets in other PLs and in a case study demonstrate that human-AI relevance agreement rates largely match the (worst case) human-human agreement under study.

Traditionally, nonconvex optimization problems are solved by forming and solving a sequence of convex optimization problems, where the cost and constraint functions are approximated locally through Taylor series expansions. This presents a challenge for functions where differentiation is expensive or unavailable. In this work, we present a derivative-free approach to form these convex approximations by computing samples of the dynamics, cost, and constraint functions and letting the solver interpolate between them. Our framework includes sample-based trajectory optimization techniques like model-predictive path integral (MPPI) control as a special case and generalizes them to enable features like multiple shooting and general equality and inequality constraints that are traditionally associated with derivative-based sequential convex programming methods. The resulting framework is simple, flexible, and capable of solving a wide variety of practical motion planning and control problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A systematic comparison of Large Language Models for automated assignment assessment in programming education: Exploring the importance of architecture and vendor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26483v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents the first large-scale, side-by-side comparison of contemporary Large Language Models (LLMs) in the automated grading of programming assignments. Drawing on over 6,000 student submissions collected across four years of an introductory programming course, we systematically analysed the distribution of grades, differences in mean scores and variability reflecting stricter or more lenient grading, and the consistency and clustering of grading patterns across models. Eighteen publicly available models were evaluated: Anthropic (claude-3-5-haiku, claude-opus-4-1, claude-sonnet-4); Deepseek (deepseek-chat, deepseek-reasoner); Google (gemini-2.0-flash-lite, gemini-2.0-flash, gemini-2.5-flash-lite, gemini-2.5-flash, gemini-2.5-pro); and OpenAI (gpt-4.1-mini, gpt-4.1-nano, gpt-4.1, gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4o, gpt-5-mini, gpt-5-nano, gpt-5). Statistical tests, correlation and clustering analyses revealed clear, systematic differences between and within vendor families, with "mini" and "nano" variants consistently underperforming their full-scale counterparts. All models displayed high internal agreement, measured by the intraclass correlation coefficient, with the model consensus but only moderate agreement with human teachers' grades, indicating a persistent gap between automated and human assessment. These findings underscore that the choice of model for educational deployment is not neutral and should be guided by pedagogical goals, transparent reporting of evaluation metrics, and ongoing human oversight to ensure accuracy, fairness and relevance.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Code to Concept: Evaluating Multiple Coordinated Views in Introductory Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26466v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novice programmers often struggle to understand how code executes and to form the abstract mental models necessary for effective problem-solving, challenges that are amplified in large, diverse introductory courses where students' backgrounds, language proficiencies, and prior experiences vary widely. This study examines whether interactive, multi-representational visualizations, combining synchronized code views, memory diagrams, and conceptual analogies, can help manage cognitive load and foster engagement more effectively than single-visual or text-only approaches. Over a 12-week deployment in a high-enrolment introductory Python course (N = 829), students who relied solely on text-based explanations reported significantly higher immediate mental effort than those using visual aids, although overall cognitive load did not differ significantly among conditions. The multi-representational approach consistently yielded higher engagement than both single-visual and text-only methods. Usage logs indicated that learners' interaction patterns varied with topic complexity, and predictive modelling suggested that early experiences of high cognitive load were associated with lower longer-term perceptions of clarity and helpfulness. Individual differences, including language proficiency and prior programming experience, moderated these patterns. By integrating multiple external representations with scaffolded support adapted to diverse learner profiles, our findings highlight design considerations for creating visualization tools that more effectively support novices learning to program.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multi-Language Object-Oriented Programming Benchmark for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.26111v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Establishing fair and robust benchmarks is essential for evaluating intelligent code generation by large language models (LLMs). Our survey of 35 existing benchmarks uncovers three major imbalances: 85.7% focus on a single programming language; 94.3% target only function-level or statement-level tasks; and over 80% include fewer than ten test cases on average. To address these gaps, we propose MultiOOP, a multi-language object-oriented programming benchmark covering six popular languages (Python, PHP, C++, C#, Java, JavaScript) with 267 tasks per language. We design a translator that extends an existing single-language OOP benchmark and the pass@o metric to a multilingual setting. Moreover, we propose an automated framework for augmenting test cases to ensure the reliability of the evaluation results. We evaluate 14 mainstream LLMs under zero-shot prompting and report three key findings: 1) Substantial performance degradation: pass@1 scores on MultiOOP drop by up to 65.6 percentage points compared to function-level tasks (e.g., HumanEval). 2) Cross-language variability: GPT-4o mini achieves pass@1 of 48.06% in Python but only 0.12%-15.26% in other languages, indicating limited multilingual generalization. 3) Conceptual gaps: pass@o scores are consistently 1.1-19.2 points lower than pass@k, demonstrating that LLMs often generate executable code without fully capturing core OOP concepts. Our benchmark, metric extensions, and evaluation scripts will be publicly released to foster a more balanced and comprehensive assessment of LLMs in object-oriented code generation. Our code and data will be released at https://github.com/alphadl/OOP-eval and https://huggingface.co/datasets/codeai-dteam/MultiOOP respectively.</p></details> | 20 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Red Teaming Program Repair Agents: When Correct Patches can Hide Vulnerabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25894v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-based agents are increasingly deployed for software maintenance tasks such as automated program repair (APR). APR agents automatically fetch GitHub issues and use backend LLMs to generate patches that fix the reported bugs. However, existing work primarily focuses on the functional correctness of APR-generated patches, whether they pass hidden or regression tests, while largely ignoring potential security risks. Given the openness of platforms like GitHub, where any user can raise issues and participate in discussions, an important question arises: Can an adversarial user submit a valid issue on GitHub that misleads an LLM-based agent into generating a functionally correct but vulnerable patch? To answer this question, we propose SWExploit, which generates adversarial issue statements designed to make APR agents produce patches that are functionally correct yet vulnerable. SWExploit operates in three main steps: (1) program analysis to identify potential injection points for vulnerable payloads; (2) adversarial issue generation to provide misleading reproduction and error information while preserving the original issue semantics; and (3) iterative refinement of the adversarial issue statements based on the outputs of the APR agents. Empirical evaluation on three agent pipelines and five backend LLMs shows that SWExploit can produce patches that are both functionally correct and vulnerable (the attack success rate on the correct patch could reach 0.91, whereas the baseline ASRs are all below 0.20). Based on our evaluation, we are the first to challenge the traditional assumption that a patch passing all tests is inherently reliable and secure, highlighting critical limitations in the current evaluation paradigm for APR agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explainable Fault Localization for Programming Assignments via LLM-Guided Annotation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25676v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Providing timely and personalized guidance for students' programming assignments, offers significant practical value for helping students complete assignments and enhance their learning. In recent years, various automated Fault Localization (FL) techniques have demonstrated promising results in identifying errors in programs. However, existing FL techniques face challenges when applied to educational contexts. Most approaches operate at the method level without explanatory feedback, resulting in granularity too coarse for students who need actionable insights to identify and fix their errors. While some approaches attempt line-level fault localization, they often depend on predicting line numbers directly in numerical form, which is ill-suited to LLMs. To address these challenges, we propose FLAME, a fine-grained, explainable Fault Localization method tailored for programming assignments via LLM-guided Annotation and Model Ensemble. FLAME leverages rich contextual information specific to programming assignments to guide LLMs in identifying faulty code lines. Instead of directly predicting line numbers, we prompt the LLM to annotate faulty code lines with detailed explanations, enhancing both localization accuracy and educational value. To further improve reliability, we introduce a weighted multi-model voting strategy that aggregates results from multiple LLMs to determine the suspiciousness of each code line. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that FLAME outperforms state-of-the-art fault localization baselines on programming assignments, successfully localizing 207 more faults at top-1 over the best-performing baseline. Beyond educational contexts, FLAME also generalizes effectively to general-purpose software codebases, outperforming all baselines on the Defects4J benchmark.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE'2025 |
| **[Quadratic Programming Approach for Nash Equilibrium Computation in Multiplayer Imperfect-Information Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25618v1)** | 2025-09-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been significant recent progress in algorithms for approximation of Nash equilibrium in large two-player zero-sum imperfect-information games and exact computation of Nash equilibrium in multiplayer strategic-form games. While counterfactual regret minimization and fictitious play are scalable to large games and have convergence guarantees in two-player zero-sum games, they do not guarantee convergence to Nash equilibrium in multiplayer games. We present an approach for exact computation of Nash equilibrium in multiplayer imperfect-information games that solves a quadratically-constrained program based on a nonlinear complementarity problem formulation from the sequence-form game representation. This approach capitalizes on recent advances for solving nonconvex quadratic programs. Our algorithm is able to quickly solve three-player Kuhn poker after removal of dominated actions. Of the available algorithms in the Gambit software suite, only the logit quantal response approach is successfully able to solve the game; however, the approach takes longer than our algorithm and also involves a degree of approximation. Our formulation also leads to a new approach for computing Nash equilibrium in multiplayer strategic-form games which we demonstrate to outperform a previous quadratically-constrained program formulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lobster: A GPU-Accelerated Framework for Neurosymbolic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.21937v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neurosymbolic programs combine deep learning with symbolic reasoning to achieve better data efficiency, interpretability, and generalizability compared to standalone deep learning approaches. However, existing neurosymbolic learning frameworks implement an uneasy marriage between a highly scalable, GPU-accelerated neural component and a slower symbolic component that runs on CPUs. We propose Lobster, a unified framework for harnessing GPUs in an end-to-end manner for neurosymbolic learning. Lobster maps a general neurosymbolic language based on Datalog to the GPU programming paradigm. This mapping is implemented via compilation to a new intermediate language called APM. The extra abstraction provided by apm allows Lobster to be both flexible, supporting discrete, probabilistic, and differentiable modes of reasoning on GPU hardware with a library of provenance semirings, and performant, implementing new optimization passes. We demonstrate that Lobster programs can solve interesting problems spanning the domains of natural language processing, image processing, program reasoning, bioinformatics, and planning. On a suite of 9 applications, Lobster achieves an average speedup of 3.9x over Scallop, a state-of-the-art neurosymbolic framework, and enables scaling of neurosymbolic solutions to previously infeasible tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ASPLOS 2026</p></details> |

| **[Smart Contract Intent Detection with Pre-trained Programming Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20086v2)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malicious developer intents in smart contracts constitute a significant security threat in decentralized applications (DApps), leading to substantial economic losses. To address this, SmartIntentNN was previously introduced as a deep learning model for detecting unsafe developer intents. It integrates the Universal Sentence Encoder, K-means clustering-based intent highlighting, and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network for multi-label classification, achieving an F1 score of 0.8633. In this study, we present an enhanced version of this model, SmartIntentNN2 (Smart Contract Intent Neural Network V2). The primary enhancement is the integration of a BERT-based pre-trained programming language model, which we domain-adaptively pre-train on a dataset of 16,000 real-world smart contracts using a Masked Language Modeling (MLM) objective. SmartIntentNN2 retains the BiLSTM-based multi-label classification network for downstream tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartIntentNN2 achieves superior overall performance with an accuracy of 0.9789, precision of 0.9090, recall of 0.9476, and an F1 score of 0.9279, substantially outperforming its predecessor and other baseline models. Notably, SmartIntentNN2 also shows significant advantages over large language models (LLMs), achieving a 65.5% relative improvement in F1 score over GPT-4.1 on this specialized task. These results establish SmartIntentNN2 as the new state-of-the-art model for smart contract intent detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Data-Driven Discrete Geofence Design Using Binary Quadratic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24679v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Geofences have attracted significant attention in the design of spatial and virtual regions for managing and engaging spatiotemporal events. By using geofences to monitor human activity across their boundaries, content providers can create spatially triggered events that include notifications about points of interest within a geofence by pushing spatial information to the devices of users. Traditionally, geofences were hand-crafted by providers. In addition to the hand-crafted approach, recent advances in collecting human mobility data through mobile devices can accelerate the automatic and data-driven design of geofences, also known as the geofence design problem. Previous approaches assume circular shapes; thus, their flexibility is insufficient, and they can only handle geofence-based applications for large areas with coarse resolutions. A challenge with using circular geofences in urban and high-resolution areas is that they often overlap and fail to align with political district boundaries and road segments, such as one-way streets and median barriers. In this study, we address the problem of extracting arbitrary shapes as geofences from human mobility data to mitigate this problem. In our formulation, we cast the existing optimization problems for circular geofences to 0-1 integer programming problems to represent arbitrary shapes. Although 0-1 integer programming problems are computationally hard, formulating them as quadratic (unconstrained) binary optimization problems enables efficient approximation of optimal solutions, because this allows the use of specialized quadratic solvers, such as the quantum annealing, and other state-of-the-art algorithms. We then develop and compare different formulation methods to extract discrete geofences. We confirmed that our new modeling approach enables flexible geofence design.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 17 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce MSG, an automated specification generation tool designed for Move smart contracts. MSG aims to highlight key insights that uniquely present when applying LLM-based specification generation to a new ecosystem. Specifically, MSG demonstrates that LLMs exhibit robust code comprehension and generation capabilities even for non-mainstream languages. MSG successfully generates verifiable specifications for 84% of tested Move functions and even identifies clauses previously overlooked by experts. Additionally, MSG shows that explicitly leveraging specification language features through an agentic, modular design improves specification quality substantially (generating 57% more verifiable clauses than conventional designs). Incorporating feedback from the verification toolchain further enhances the effectiveness of MSG, leading to a 30% increase in generated verifiable specifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages; Extended version of ASE'25 paper with extra appendices</p></details> |
| **[Toward Causal-Visual Programming: Enhancing Agentic Reasoning in Low-Code Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25282v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 table |

However, the NP-hard nature of MILP presents a significant computational challenge, motivating the development of machine learning-based heuristic solutions to accelerate downstream solvers. While recent generative models have shown promise in learning powerful heuristics, they suffer from a critical limitation. That is, they model the distribution of only the integer variables and fail to capture the intricate coupling between integer and continuous variables, creating an information bottleneck and ultimately leading to suboptimal solutions. To this end, we propose Joint Continuous-Integer Flow for Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (FMIP), which is the first generative framework that models the joint distribution of both integer and continuous variables for MILP solutions. Built upon the joint modeling paradigm, a holistic guidance mechanism is designed to steer the generative trajectory, actively refining solutions toward optimality and feasibility during the inference process. Extensive experiments on eight standard MILP benchmarks demonstrate the superior performance of FMIP against existing baselines, reducing the primal gap by 41.34% on average. Moreover, we show that FMIP is fully compatible with arbitrary backbone networks and various downstream solvers, making it well-suited for a broad range of real-world MILP applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>FMIP ...</summary><p>FMIP is a generative framework that jointly models integer and continuous variables in MILP, achieving a 41.34% reduction in primal gap and demonstrating compatibility with various solvers and applications</p></details> |

Classic Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) methods and concolic execution-based approaches for generating unit tests often fail to achieve high coverage due to difficulties in handling complex program units, such as branching conditions and external dependencies. Recent work has increasingly utilized large language models (LLMs) to generate test cases, improving the quality of test generation by providing better context and correcting errors in the model's output. However, these methods rely on fixed prompts, resulting in relatively low compilation success rates and coverage. This paper presents PALM, an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance the generation of high-coverage unit tests. PALM performs program analysis to identify branching conditions within functions, which are then combined into path constraints. These constraints and relevant contextual information are used to construct prompts that guide the LLMs in generating unit tests. We implement the approach and evaluate it in 15 open-source Rust crates. Experimental results show that within just two or three hours, PALM can significantly improve test coverage compared to classic methods, with increases in overall project coverage exceeding 50% in some instances and its generated tests achieving an average coverage of 72.30%, comparable to human effort (70.94%), highlighting the potential of LLMs in automated test generation. We submitted 91 PALM-generated unit tests targeting new code. Of these submissions, 80 were accepted, 5 were rejected, and 6 remain pending review. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating program analysis with AI and open new avenues for future research in automated software testing.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ASE 2025 (Research Paper Track). 11 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |
| **[Interactive Program Synthesis for Modeling Collaborative Physical Activities from Narrated Demonstrations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24250v1)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teaching systems physical tasks is a long standing goal in HCI, yet most prior work has focused on non collaborative physical activities. Collaborative tasks introduce added complexity, requiring systems to infer users assumptions about their teammates intent, which is an inherently ambiguous and dynamic process. This necessitates representations that are interpretable and correctable, enabling users to inspect and refine system behavior. We address this challenge by framing collaborative task learning as a program synthesis problem. Our system represents behavior as editable programs and uses narrated demonstrations, i.e. paired physical actions and natural language, as a unified modality for teaching, inspecting, and correcting system logic without requiring users to see or write code. The same modality is used for the system to communicate its learning to users. In a within subjects study, 20 users taught multiplayer soccer tactics to our system. 70 percent (14/20) of participants successfully refined learned programs to match their intent and 90 percent (18/20) found it easy to correct the programs. The study surfaced unique challenges in representing learning as programs and in enabling users to teach collaborative physical activities. We discuss these issues and outline mitigation strategies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Various Software Artifacts for Better LLM-based Bug Localization and Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03905v4)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. Furthermore, we re-implemented and evaluated our framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in its effectiveness in resolving 9 unique issues compared to other state-of-the-art frameworks using the same or more advanced models on SWE-bench Lite.We also discussed whether a leading framework for Python code can be directly applied to Java code, or vice versa.

Inspired by the Graph-of-Convex-Sets formulation, temporal predicates are encoded as polyhedron constraints on each edge of a network flow model, instead of as constraints between nodes in traditional Logic Tree formulations. We further propose a network-flow-based Fourier-Motzkin elimination procedure that removes continuous flow variables while preserving convex relaxation tightness, leading to provably tighter convex relaxations and fewer constraints than Logic Tree formulations. For temporal logic motion planning with piecewise-affine dynamic systems, comprehensive experiments across vehicle routing, multi-robot coordination, and temporal logic control on dynamical systems using point mass and linear inverted pendulum models demonstrate computational speedups of up to several orders of magnitude. Hardware demonstrations with quadrupedal robots validate real-time replanning capabilities under dynamically changing environmental conditions.

Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a rapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt trial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1) inherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low search efficiency due to redundant exploration. In this paper, we propose APRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. APRMCTS incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing a global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising one for subsequent refinement and generation. APRMCTS effectively resolves the problems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of patch searching. Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that, when integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs, respectively. More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance advantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the 500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies. In terms of cost, compared to existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and monetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively. Our extensive study demonstrates that APRMCTS exhibits good effectiveness and efficiency, with particular advantages in addressing complex bugs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering, ASE 2025</p></details> |

Their test-time compute (TTC) reasoning capabilities show significant potential for understanding program logic and semantics beyond mere token recognition. However, current benchmarks for code reasoning lack a formal, program-centric deductive framework to ensure sound evaluation, and are incapable of assessing whether models genuinely reason about program semantics or merely exploit superficial associations between natural language and code tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce TF-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM reasoning based on type inference in System F, a task we refer to as program semantics reasoning. By employing verified transformations to remove semantically irrelevant natural language, we construct TF-Bench_pure, a purely semantics-driven variant of TF-Bench. Our analysis reveals substantial limitations in state-of-the-art LLMs, with the best-performing LLM (Claude-3.7-sonnet) achieving only 55.85% accuracy on TF-Bench_pure. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics to assess robustness and the effectiveness of test-time reasoning, underscoring critical limitations in current LLM capabilities and highlighting essential directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS '25, package released at: https://github.com/SecurityLab-UCD/TF-Bench</p></details> |

While prior works have focused on prompt design and code generation quality, the broader impact of LLM-driven development on the iterative dynamics of software engineering remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct large-scale experiments on thousands of algorithmic programming tasks and hundreds of framework selection tasks to systematically investigate how AI-assisted programming interacts with the software ecosystem. Our analysis reveals \textbf{a striking Matthew effect: the more popular a programming language or framework, the higher the success rate of LLM-generated code}. The phenomenon suggests that AI systems may reinforce existing popularity hierarchies, accelerating convergence around dominant tools while hindering diversity and innovation. We provide a quantitative characterization of this effect and discuss its implications for the future evolution of programming ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

We formalize a type system that restricts the arrays to finite size. We then define a semantics that is parameterized by the semiring that the arrays draw their elements from. We compile semiringKanren types to bitstring representations. For the Boolean semiring, this compilation enables us to use an SAT solver to run semiringKanren programs efficiently. We compare the performance of semiringKanren and faster miniKanren for solving Sudoku puzzles. Our experiment shows that semiringKanren can be a more efficient variant of miniKanren.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, for associated repo see https://github.com/sporkl/semiringkanren</p></details> |
| **[GPU-Accelerated Loopy Belief Propagation for Program Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22337v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Loopy Belief Propagation (LBP) is a widely used approximate inference algorithm in probabilistic graphical models, with applications in computer vision, error correction codes, protein folding, program analysis, etc. However, LBP faces significant computational challenges when applied to large-scale program analysis. While GPU (Graphics Processing Unit) parallel computing provides a promising solution, existing approaches lack support for flexible update strategies and have yet to integrate logical constraints with GPU acceleration, leading to suboptimal practical performance. This paper presents a GPU-accelerated LBP algorithm for program analysis. To support the diverse update strategies required by users, we propose a unified representation for specifying arbitrary user-defined update strategies, along with a dependency analysis algorithm. Furthermore, building on previous work that leverages the local structure of Horn clauses to simplify message passing, we group messages to minimize warp divergence and better utilize GPU resources. Experimental results on datarace analysis over eight real-world Java programs show that our approach achieves an average speedup of $2.14\times$ over the state-of-the-art sequential approach and $5.56\times$ over the state-of-the-art GPU-based approach, while maintaining high accuracy.</p></details> |  |

First, we construct Ver-OTPs from single-qubit states and classical cryptographic primitives. Then, assuming a multi-key homomorphic scheme (MHE) with certain properties, we use Ver-OTPs with MHE to construct OSC. The underlying quantum requirement is minimal: only single-qubit states are needed alongside a hardware assumption on the receiver's quantum resources. Our work therefore provides a new framework for quantum-assisted cryptography that may be implementable with near-term quantum technology.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiMat: Multimodal Program Synthesis for Procedural Materials using Large Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22151v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Material node graphs are programs that generate the 2D channels of procedural materials, including geometry such as roughness and displacement maps, and reflectance such as albedo and conductivity maps. They are essential in computer graphics for representing the appearance of virtual 3D objects parametrically and at arbitrary resolution. In particular, their directed acyclic graph structures and intermediate states provide an intuitive understanding and workflow for interactive appearance modeling. Creating such graphs is a challenging task and typically requires professional training. While recent neural program synthesis approaches attempt to simplify this process, they solely represent graphs as textual programs, failing to capture the inherently visual-spatial nature of node graphs that makes them accessible to humans. To address this gap, we present MultiMat, a multimodal program synthesis framework that leverages large multimodal models to process both visual and textual graph representations for improved generation of procedural material graphs. We train our models on a new dataset of production-quality procedural materials and combine them with a constrained tree search inference algorithm that ensures syntactic validity while efficiently navigating the program space. Our experimental results show that our multimodal program synthesis method is more efficient in both unconditional and conditional graph synthesis with higher visual quality and fidelity than text-only baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICLR 2026</p></details> |

We establish the nonasymptotic consistency result of our PADR-based ERM model for unconstrained problems and asymptotic consistency result for constrained ones. To solve the nonconvex and nondifferentiable ERM problem, we develop an enhanced stochastic majorization-minimization algorithm and establish the asymptotic convergence to (composite strong) directional stationarity along with complexity analysis. We show that the proposed PADR-based ERM method applies to a broad class of nonconvex SP problems with theoretical consistency guarantees and computational tractability. Our numerical study demonstrates the superior performance of PADR-based ERM methods compared to state-of-the-art approaches under various settings, with significantly lower costs, less computation time, and robustness to feature dimensions and nonlinearity of the underlying dependency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Abductive Logical Rule Induction by Bridging Inductive Logic Programming and Multimodal Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21874v1)** | 2025-09-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose ILP-CoT, a method that bridges Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) and Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) for abductive logical rule induction. The task involves both discovering logical facts and inducing logical rules from a small number of unstructured textual or visual inputs, which still remain challenging when solely relying on ILP, due to the requirement of specified background knowledge and high computational cost, or MLLMs, due to the appearance of perceptual hallucinations. Based on the key observation that MLLMs could propose structure-correct rules even under hallucinations, our approach automatically builds ILP tasks with pruned search spaces based on the rule structure proposals from MLLMs, and utilizes ILP system to output rules built upon rectified logical facts and formal inductive reasoning. Its effectiveness is verified through challenging logical induction benchmarks, as well as a potential application of our approach, namely text-to-image customized generation with rule induction. Our code and data are released at https://github.com/future-item/ILP-CoT.</p></details> |  |

However, their performance on Low-Resource Programming Languages (LRPLs) and Domain-Specific Languages (DSLs) remains a significant challenge, affecting millions of developers-3.5 million users in Rust alone-who cannot fully utilize LLM capabilities. LRPLs and DSLs encounter unique obstacles, including data scarcity and, for DSLs, specialized syntax that is poorly represented in general-purpose datasets. Addressing these challenges is crucial, as LRPLs and DSLs enhance development efficiency in specialized domains, such as finance and science. While several surveys discuss LLMs in software engineering, none focus specifically on the challenges and opportunities associated with LRPLs and DSLs. Our survey fills this gap by systematically reviewing the current state, methodologies, and challenges in leveraging LLMs for code generation in these languages. We filtered 111 papers from over 27,000 published studies between 2020 and 2024 to evaluate the capabilities and limitations of LLMs in LRPLs and DSLs. We report the LLMs used, benchmarks, and metrics for evaluation, strategies for enhancing performance, and methods for dataset collection and curation. We identified four main evaluation techniques and several metrics for assessing code generation in LRPLs and DSLs. Our analysis categorizes improvement methods into six groups and summarizes novel architectures proposed by researchers. Despite various techniques and metrics, a standard approach and benchmark dataset for evaluating code generation in LRPLs and DSLs are lacking. This survey serves as a resource for researchers and practitioners at the intersection of LLMs, software engineering, and specialized programming languages, laying the groundwork for future advancements in code generation for LRPLs and DSLs.</p></details> | <details><summary>64 pa...</summary><p>64 pages, 3 figures, 15 tables.

| **[SuperCoder: Assembly Program Superoptimization with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11480v2)** | 2025-09-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Superoptimization is the task of transforming a program into a faster one while preserving its input-output behavior. In this work, we investigate whether large language models (LLMs) can serve as superoptimizers, generating assembly programs that outperform code already optimized by industry-standard compilers. We construct the first large-scale benchmark for this problem, consisting of 8,072 real-world assembly programs averaging 130 lines, in contrast to prior datasets restricted to 2-15 straight-line, loop-free programs. We evaluate 23 LLMs on this benchmark and find that the strongest baseline, Claude-opus-4, achieves a 51.5% test-passing rate and a 1.43x average speedup over gcc -O3. To further enhance performance, we fine-tune models with reinforcement learning, optimizing a reward function that integrates correctness and performance speedup. Starting from Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct (61.4% correctness, 1.10x speedup), the fine-tuned model SuperCoder attains 95.0% correctness and 1.46x average speedup. Our results demonstrate, for the first time, that LLMs can be applied as superoptimizers for assembly programs, establishing a foundation for future research in program performance optimization beyond compiler heuristics.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a principled framework for evaluating LLMs on invariant synthesis. Our approach uses a verifier-based decision procedure with a formal soundness guarantee and assesses not only correctness but also the speedup that invariants provide in verification. We evaluate 7 state-of-the-art LLMs, and existing LLM-based verifiers against the traditional solver UAutomizer. While LLM-based verifiers represent a promising direction, they do not yet offer a significant advantage over UAutomizer. Model capability also proves critical, as shown by sharp differences in speedups across models, and our benchmark remains an open challenge for current LLMs. Finally, we show that supervised fine-tuning and Best-of-N sampling can improve performance: fine-tuning on 3589 instances raises the percentage of speedup cases for Qwen3-Coder-480B from 8% to 29.2%, and Best-of-N sampling with N=16 improves Claude-sonnet-4 from 8.8% to 22.1%.</p></details> |  |

Most compilers leverage the capabilities of digital and analog quantum computers by representing quantum particle systems with Pauli strings or digital quantum circuits, making it challenging for users in physics, chemistry, and biology to program simulations effectively. QBLUE is proposed as the first programming language for describing the behaviors of quantum systems in terms of second quantization Hamiltonians. Within QBLUE, a novel type system is proposed to clearly define states across different quantum systems and treat quantum computers as quantum particle systems of specific types. The type system is compatible with the compilation of quantum simulations expressed in QBLUE for digital and analog quantum computers. With QBLUE, users can specify the desired quantum particle system and model the system on quantum computers.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted talk paper in the 22nd International Conference on Quantum Physics and Logic (QPL 2025)</p></details> |

This paper presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of a novel programming language topic classification workflow. Our approach combines a multi-label Support Vector Machine (SVM) with a sliding window and voting strategy to enable fine-grained localization of core language concepts such as operator overloading, virtual functions, inheritance, and templates. Trained on the IBM Project CodeNet dataset, our model achieves an average F1 score of 0.90 across topics and 0.75 in code-topic highlight.

Traditional coding tools like Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and static analyzers do not give robotic help while AI-driven code assistants such as GitHub Copilot focus on getting things done. To close this gap, our chatbot combines static code analysis, dynamic execution tracing, and large language models (LLMs) to provide the students with relevant and practical advice, hence promoting the learning process. The chatbots hybrid architecture employs CodeLlama for code embedding, GPT-4 for natural language interactions, and Docker-based sandboxing for secure execution. Evaluated through a mixed-methods approach involving 1,500 student submissions, the system demonstrated an 85% error resolution success rate, outperforming standalone tools like pylint (62%) and GPT-4 (73%). Quantitative results revealed a 59.3% reduction in debugging time among users, with pre- and post-test assessments showing a 34% improvement in coding proficiency, particularly in recursion and exception handling. Qualitative feedback from 120 students highlighted the chatbots clarity, accessibility, and confidence-building impact, though critiques included occasional latency and restrictive code sanitization. By balancing technical innovation with pedagogical empathy, this research provides a blueprint for AI tools that prioritize educational equity and long-term skill retention over mere code completion. The chatbot exemplifies how AI can augment human instruction, fostering deeper conceptual understanding in programming education.</p></details> | 20 pages, 16 figures |
| **[Dual-Language General-Purpose Self-Hosted Visual Language and new Textual Programming Language for Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20426v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most visual programming languages (VPLs) are domain-specific, with few general-purpose VPLs like Programming Without Coding Technology (PWCT). These general-purpose VPLs are developed using textual programming languages and improving them requires textual programming. In this thesis, we designed and developed PWCT2, a dual-language (Arabic/English), general-purpose, self-hosting visual programming language. Before doing so, we specifically designed a textual programming language called Ring for its development. Ring is a dynamically typed language with a lightweight implementation, offering syntax customization features. It permits the creation of domain-specific languages through new features that extend object-oriented programming, allowing for specialized languages resembling Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) or Supernova language. The Ring Compiler and Virtual Machine are designed using the PWCT visual programming language where the visual implementation is composed of 18,945 components that generate 24,743 lines of C code, which increases the abstraction level and hides unnecessary details. Using PWCT to develop Ring allowed us to realize several issues in PWCT, which led to the development of the PWCT2 visual programming language using the Ring textual programming language. PWCT2 provides approximately 36 times faster code generation and requires 20 times less storage for visual source files. It also allows for the conversion of Ring code into visual code, enabling the creation of a self-hosting VPL that can be developed using itself. PWCT2 consists of approximately 92,000 lines of Ring code and comes with 394 visual components. PWCT2 is distributed to many users through the Steam platform and has received positive feedback, On Steam, 1772 users have launched the software, and the total recorded usage time exceeds 17,000 hours, encouraging further research and development.</p></details> | PhD thesis |

We start formulating the control problem in a general dynamic programming framework, introducing the mathematical structure needed for a detailed convergence analysis. The associate value function is estimated through a sequence of approximations combining nonparametric regression methods and Monte Carlo subsampling. The regression step is performed within reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces (RKHSs), exploiting the classical KRR algorithm, while Monte Carlo sampling methods are introduced to estimate the continuation value. To assess the accuracy of our value function estimator, we propose a natural error decomposition and rigorously control the resulting error terms at each time step. We then analyze how this error propagates backward in time-from maturity to the initial stage-a relatively underexplored aspect of the SOC literature. Finally, we illustrate how our analysis naturally applies to a key financial application: the pricing of American options.</p></details> |  |
| **[Analysis of approximate linear programming solution to Markov decision problem with log barrier function](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19800v1)** | 2025-09-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are two primary approaches to solving Markov decision problems (MDPs): dynamic programming based on the Bellman equation and linear programming (LP). Dynamic programming methods are the most widely used and form the foundation of both classical and modern reinforcement learning (RL). By contrast, LP-based methods have been less commonly employed, although they have recently gained attention in contexts such as offline RL. The relative underuse of the LP-based methods stems from the fact that it leads to an inequality-constrained optimization problem, which is generally more challenging to solve effectively compared with Bellman-equation-based methods. The purpose of this paper is to establish a theoretical foundation for solving LP-based MDPs in a more effective and practical manner. Our key idea is to leverage the log-barrier function, widely used in inequality-constrained optimization, to transform the LP formulation of the MDP into an unconstrained optimization problem. This reformulation enables approximate solutions to be obtained easily via gradient descent. While the method may appear simple, to the best of our knowledge, a thorough theoretical interpretation of this approach has not yet been developed. This paper aims to bridge this gap.</p></details> |  |

In many control algorithms, LPs are often automatically generated and frequently solved either offline or online in the control loop. This motivates the design of linrax, which is especially suited for compilation into a complex JAX-based pipeline as a subroutine. We discuss the challenges associated with implementing a general purpose LP solver under strict design requirements from JAX. Notably, we can solve general problems which may include dependent constraints-something not possible with existing JAX-compatible LP solvers that use first-order techniques and may fail to converge. We demonstrate the utility of linrax through several examples, including a robust control synthesis pipeline for a nonlinear vehicle model using automatic differentiation through a LP-based reachable set framework.</p></details> | 8 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Integrating Belief Domains into Probabilistic Logic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17291v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic Logic Programming (PLP) under the Distribution Semantics is a leading approach to practical reasoning under uncertainty. An advantage of the Distribution Semantics is its suitability for implementation as a Prolog or Python library, available through two well-maintained implementations, namely ProbLog and cplint/PITA. However, current formulations of the Distribution Semantics use point-probabilities, making it difficult to express epistemic uncertainty, such as arises from, for example, hierarchical classifications from computer vision models. Belief functions generalize probability measures as non-additive capacities, and address epistemic uncertainty via interval probabilities. This paper introduces interval-based Capacity Logic Programs based on an extension of the Distribution Semantics to include belief functions, and describes properties of the new framework that make it amenable to practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)</p></details> |

However, previous approaches often rely on closed-source models, lack systematic reasoning, and struggle with long-form video question answering (videoQA). To address these challenges, we introduce the FS-VisPR framework, an adaptive visual program reasoning approach that balances fast reasoning for simple queries with slow reasoning for difficult ones. First, we design efficient visual modules (e.g., key clip retrieval and subtitle retrieval) to support long-form video tasks. Then, we construct a diverse and high-quality fast-slow reasoning dataset with a strong LLM to align open-source language models' ability to generate visual program workflows as FS-LLM. Next, we design a fast-slow reasoning framework with FS-LLM: Simple queries are directly solved by VideoLLMs, while difficult ones invoke visual program reasoning, motivated by human-like reasoning processes. During this process, low-confidence fast-thinking answers will trigger a second-stage slow-reasoning process, and a fallback mechanism to fast reasoning is activated if the program execution fails. Moreover, we improve visual programs through parameter search during both training and inference. By adjusting the parameters of the visual modules within the program, multiple variants are generated: during training, programs that yield correct answers are selected, while during inference, the program with the highest confidence result is applied. Experiments show that FS-VisPR improves both efficiency and reliability in visual program workflows. It achieves 50.4% accuracy on LVBench, surpassing GPT-4o, matching the performance of Qwen2.5VL-72B on VideoMME.</p></details> |  |
| **[Program Synthesis via Test-Time Transduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17393v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce transductive program synthesis, a new formulation of the program synthesis task that explicitly leverages test inputs during synthesis. While prior approaches to program synthesis--whether based on natural language descriptions or input-output examples--typically aim to generalize from training examples, they often struggle with robustness, especially in real-world settings where training examples are limited and test inputs involve various edge cases. To address this, we propose a novel framework that improves robustness by treating synthesis as an active learning over a finite hypothesis class defined by programs' outputs. We use an LLM to predict outputs for selected test inputs and eliminate inconsistent hypotheses, where the inputs are chosen via a greedy maximin algorithm to minimize the number of LLM queries required. We evaluate our approach on four benchmarks: Playgol, MBPP+, 1D-ARC, and programmatic world modeling on MiniGrid. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves program synthesis in both accuracy and efficiency. We release our code at https://github.com/klee972/SYNTRA.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Concurrency bugs still occur in Rust programs, and existing detection approaches exhibit significant limitations: static analyzers suffer from context insensitivity and high false positives, while dynamic methods incur prohibitive runtime costs due to exponential path exploration. This paper presents a Petri net-based method for efficient, precise detection of Rust concurrency bugs. The method rests on three pillars: (1) A syntax-preserving program-to-Petri-net transformation tailored for target bug classes; (2) Semantics-preserving state compression via context-aware slicing; (3) Bug detection through efficient Petri net reachability analysis. The core innovation is its rigorous, control-flow-driven modeling of Rust's ownership semantics and synchronization primitives within the Petri net structure, with data operations represented as token movements. Integrated pointer analysis automates alias identification during transformation. Experiments on standard Rust concurrency benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods LockBud and Miri that are both tools of detecting concurrency bugs of Rust programs. Compared to LockBud, our approach reduces false positives by 35.7\% and false negatives by 28.3\% , which is obtained through our precise flow-sensitive pointer analysis. Compared with Miri that is a dynamic analysis tool, although Miri can obtain the same detection results, our method achieves 100% faster verification speed since our method takes a state reduce algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[Asymmetric Burer-Monteiro Factorization with Theoretically Sound Penalty for Semidefinite Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01198v10)** | 2025-09-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the solving of large-scale semidefinite programs (SDPs), the symmetric Burer-Monteiro factorization (BMF) offers an economical low-rank solution of the form $XX^\top$. However, BMF turns a convex SDP into a more difficult nonconvex optimization problem in some cases, which limits the use of off-the-shelf convex optimization algorithms. To alleviate this problem, we convert symmetric BMF to its asymmetric counterpart involving $XY^\top$, and use a penalty with parameter $\gamma$ to encourage $X$ and $Y$ to be close. We show that the resultant asymmetric BMF is multi-convex, and thus convex optimization can again be used to solve the subproblems involving $X$ and $Y$ in an alternating manner. More importantly, to ensure that $X=Y$ on convergence, we derive theoretically sound conditions for exact $\gamma$ that are independent of both the application problem and underlying algorithm. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method is more advantageous over existing related approaches.</p></details> |  |

Traditional static slicing tools rely on parsing complete source code, which limits their applicability to real-world scenarios where code snippets are incomplete or unparsable. While recent research developed learning-based approaches to predict slices, they face critical challenges: (1) Inaccurate dependency identification, where models fail to precisely capture data and control dependencies between code elements; and (2) Unconstrained generation, where models produce slices with extraneous or hallucinated tokens not present in the input, violating the structural integrity of slices. To address these challenges, we propose \ourtool, a novel slicing framework that reformulates static program slicing as a sequence-to-sequence task using lightweight language models (e.g., CodeT5+). Our approach incorporates two key innovations. First, we introduce a copy mechanism that enables the model to more accurately capture inter-element dependencies and directly copy relevant tokens from the input, improving both dependency reasoning and generation constraint. Second, we design a constrained decoding process with (a) lexical constraint, restricting outputs to input tokens only, and (b) syntactic constraint, leveraging Tree Similarity of Edit Distance (TSED) monotonicity to detect structurally invalid outputs and discard them. We evaluate \ourtool on CodeNet and LeetCode datasets and show it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving ExactMatch scores by up to 27\%. Furthermore, \ourtool demonstrates strong performance on incomplete code, highlighting its robustness and practical utility in real-world development environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 tab...</summary><p>3 tables, 6 Figures, 12 pages</p></details> |

While recent frameworks based on Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) can accelerate the solving process, their performance is often constrained by the difficulty in generating sufficiently effective neighborhoods. To address this challenge, we propose HyP-ASO, a hybrid policy-based adaptive search optimization framework that combines a customized formula with deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). The formula leverages feasible solutions to calculate the selection probabilities for each variable in the neighborhood generation process, and the RL policy network predicts the neighborhood size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyP-ASO significantly outperforms existing LNS-based approaches for large-scale ILPs. Additional experiments show it is lightweight and highly scalable, making it well-suited for solving large-scale ILPs.</p></details> |  |

Existing methods either involve matrix decomposition or use the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. For relatively large instances, these methods cannot achieve the real-time requirement unless there is an effective preconditioner. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) opened new possibilities for QP. Some promising empirical studies of applying GNNs for QP tasks show that GNNs can capture key characteristics of an optimization instance and provide adaptive guidance accordingly to crucial configurations during the solving process, or directly provide an approximate solution. However, the theoretical understanding of GNNs in this context remains limited. Specifically, it is unclear what GNNs can and cannot achieve for QP tasks in theory. This work addresses this gap in the context of linearly constrained QP tasks. In the continuous setting, we prove that message-passing GNNs can universally represent fundamental properties of convex quadratic programs, including feasibility, optimal objective values, and optimal solutions. In the more challenging mixed-integer setting, while GNNs are not universal approximators, we identify a subclass of QP problems that GNNs can reliably represent.</p></details> |  |

We compare neural program synthesis and test-time fine-tuning approaches on this experiment. We find that execution-guided neural program synthesis outperforms all reference algorithms in its ability to compose novel solutions. Our empirical findings also suggest that the success of TTFT on ARC-AGI lies mainly in eliciting in-distribution knowledge that the LLM otherwise fails to rely on directly.</p></details> | <details><summary>this ...</summary><p>this version fixes errors in AlphaEvolve total % calculation, Table 3 DSL description, and adds clarifications in response to review criticisms</p></details> |
| **[Agentic AI Software Engineers: Programming with Trust](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13767v4)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown surprising proficiency in generating code snippets, promising to automate large parts of software engineering via artificial intelligence (AI). We argue that successfully deploying AI software engineers requires a level of trust equal to or even greater than the trust established by human-driven software engineering practices. The recent trend toward LLM agents offers a path toward integrating the power of LLMs to create new code with the power of analysis tools to increase trust in the code. This opinion piece comments on whether LLM agents could dominate software engineering workflows in the future and whether the focus of programming will shift from programming at scale to programming with trust.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[Differential Privacy for Euclidean Jordan Algebra with Applications to Private Symmetric Cone Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16915v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we study differentially private mechanisms for functions whose outputs lie in a Euclidean Jordan algebra. Euclidean Jordan algebras capture many important mathematical structures and form the foundation of linear programming, second-order cone programming, and semidefinite programming. Our main contribution is a generic Gaussian mechanism for such functions, with sensitivity measured in $\ell_2$, $\ell_1$, and $\ell_\infty$ norms. Notably, this framework includes the important case where the function outputs are symmetric matrices, and sensitivity is measured in the Frobenius, nuclear, or spectral norm. We further derive private algorithms for solving symmetric cone programs under various settings, using a combination of the multiplicative weights update method and our generic Gaussian mechanism. As an application, we present differentially private algorithms for semidefinite programming, resolving a major open question posed by [Hsu, Roth, Roughgarden, and Ullman, ICALP 2014].</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[RelRepair: Enhancing Automated Program Repair by Retrieving Relevant Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16701v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for reducing debugging time and improving the overall efficiency of software development. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automated bug fixing and other software engineering tasks. Nevertheless, the general-purpose nature of LLM pre-training means these models often lack the capacity to perform project-specific repairs, which require understanding of domain-specific identifiers, code structures, and contextual relationships within a particular codebase. As a result, LLMs may struggle to generate correct patches when the repair depends on project-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce RelRepair, a novel approach that retrieves relevant project-specific code to enhance automated program repair. RelRepair first identifies relevant function signatures by analyzing function names and code comments within the project. It then conducts deeper code analysis to retrieve code snippets relevant to the repair context. The retrieved relevant information is then incorporated into the LLM's input prompt, guiding the model to generate more accurate and informed patches. We evaluate RelRepair on two widely studied datasets, Defects4J V1.2 and ManySStuBs4J, and compare its performance against several state-of-the-art LLM-based APR approaches. RelRepair successfully repairs 101 bugs in Defects4J V1.2. Furthermore, RelRepair achieves a 17.1\% improvement in the ManySStuBs4J dataset, increasing the overall fix rate to 48.3\%. These results highlight the importance of providing relevant project-specific information to LLMs, shedding light on effective strategies for leveraging LLMs in APR tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, under review at TSE</p></details> |
| **[Is Measurement Enough? Rethinking Output Validation in Quantum Program Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16595v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As quantum computing continues to emerge, ensuring the quality of quantum programs has become increasingly critical. Quantum program testing has emerged as a prominent research area within the scope of quantum software engineering. While numerous approaches have been proposed to address quantum program quality assurance, our analysis reveals that most existing methods rely on measurement-based validation in practice. However, due to the inherently probabilistic nature of quantum programs, measurement-based validation methods face significant limitations. To investigate these limitations, we conducted an empirical study of recent research on quantum program testing, analyzing measurement-based validation methods in the literature. Our analysis categorizes existing measurement-based validation methods into two groups: distribution-level validation and output-value-level validation. We then compare measurement-based validation with statevector-based validation methods to evaluate their pros and cons. Our findings demonstrate that measurement-based validation is suitable for straightforward assessments, such as verifying the existence of specific output values, while statevector-based validation proves more effective for complicated tasks such as assessing the program behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will be appeared in the proceedings of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2025), NIER track, Seoul, South Korea, November 16 -20, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Domain-Informed Genetic Superposition Programming: A Case Study on SFRC Beams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.21355v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study presents domain-informed genetic superposition programming (DIGSP), a symbolic regression framework tailored for engineering systems governed by separable physical mechanisms. DIGSP partitions the input space into domain-specific feature subsets and evolves independent genetic programming (GP) populations to model material-specific effects. Early evolution occurs in isolation, while ensemble fitness promotes inter-population cooperation. To enable symbolic superposition, an adaptive hierarchical symbolic abstraction mechanism (AHSAM) is triggered after stagnation across all populations. AHSAM performs analysis of variance- (ANOVA) based filtering to identify statistically significant individuals, compresses them into symbolic constructs, and injects them into all populations through a validation-guided pruning cycle. The DIGSP is benchmarked against a baseline multi-gene genetic programming (BGP) model using a dataset of steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC) beams. Across 30 independent trials with 65% training, 10% validation, and 25% testing splits, DIGSP consistently outperformed BGP in training and test root mean squared error (RMSE). The Wilcoxon rank-sum test confirmed statistical significance (p < 0.01), and DIGSP showed tighter error distributions and fewer outliers. No significant difference was observed in validation RMSE due to limited sample size. These results demonstrate that domain-informed structural decomposition and symbolic abstraction improve convergence and generalization. DIGSP offers a principled and interpretable modeling strategy for systems where symbolic superposition aligns with the underlying physical structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 6 tables, 4 figures</p></details> |
| **[EquiBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models' Reasoning about Program Semantics via Equivalence Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.12466v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) become integral to code-related tasks, a central question emerges: Do LLMs truly understand program semantics? We introduce EquiBench, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs through equivalence checking, i.e., determining whether two programs produce identical outputs for all possible inputs. Unlike prior code generation benchmarks, this task directly tests a model's ability to reason about program semantics. EquiBench consists of 2400 program pairs across four languages and six categories. These pairs are generated through program analysis, compiler scheduling, and superoptimization, ensuring high-confidence labels, nontrivial difficulty, and full automation. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art LLMs and find that in the most challenging categories, the best accuracies are 63.8% and 76.2%, only modestly above the 50% random baseline. Further analysis reveals that models often rely on syntactic similarity rather than exhibiting robust reasoning about program semantics, highlighting current limitations. Our code and dataset are publicly available at https://github.com/Anjiang-Wei/equibench</p></details> |  |
| **[LiteRSan: Lightweight Memory Safety Via Rust-specific Program Analysis and Selective Instrumentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16389v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rust is a memory-safe language, and its strong safety guarantees combined with high performance have been attracting widespread adoption in systems programming and security-critical applications. However, Rust permits the use of unsafe code, which bypasses compiler-enforced safety checks and can introduce memory vulnerabilities. A widely adopted approach for detecting memory safety bugs in Rust is Address Sanitizer (ASan). Optimized versions, such as ERASan and RustSan, have been proposed to selectively apply security checks in order to reduce performance overhead. However, these tools still incur significant performance and memory overhead and fail to detect many classes of memory safety vulnerabilities due to the inherent limitations of ASan. In this paper, we present LiteRSan, a novel memory safety sanitizer that addresses the limitations of prior approaches. By leveraging Rust's unique ownership model, LiteRSan performs Rust-specific static analysis that is aware of pointer lifetimes to identify risky pointers. It then selectively instruments risky pointers to enforce only the necessary spatial or temporal memory safety checks. Consequently, LiteRSan introduces significantly lower runtime overhead (18.84% versus 152.05% and 183.50%) and negligible memory overhead (0.81% versus 739.27% and 861.98%) compared with existing ASan-based sanitizers while being capable of detecting memory safety bugs that prior techniques miss.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages (main text), 18 pages including references and appendix, 2 figures</p></details> |
| **[Understanding the Role of Large Language Models in Competitive Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15867v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates how large language models (LLMs) are reshaping competitive programming. The field functions as an intellectual contest within computer science education and is marked by rapid iteration, real-time feedback, transparent solutions, and strict integrity norms. Prior work has evaluated LLMs performance on contest problems, but little is known about how human stakeholders -- contestants, problem setters, coaches, and platform stewards -- are adapting their workflows and contest norms under LLMs-induced shifts. At the same time, rising AI-assisted misuse and inconsistent governance expose urgent gaps in sustaining fairness and credibility. Drawing on 37 interviews spanning all four roles and a global survey of 207 contestants, we contribute: (i) an empirical account of evolving workflows, (ii) an analysis of contested fairness norms, and (iii) a chess-inspired governance approach with actionable measures -- real-time LLMs checks in online contests, peer co-monitoring and reporting, and cross-validation against offline performance -- to curb LLMs-assisted misuse while preserving fairness, transparency, and credibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weighted Automata for Exact Inference in Discrete Probabilistic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15074v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In probabilistic programming, the inference problem asks to determine a program's posterior distribution conditioned on its "observe" instructions. Inference is challenging, especially when exact rather than approximate results are required. Inspired by recent work on probability generating functions (PGFs), we propose encoding distributions on $\mathbb{N}^k$ as weighted automata over a commutative alphabet with $k$ symbols. Based on this, we map the semantics of various imperative programming statements to automata-theoretic constructions. For a rich class of programs, this results in an effective translation from prior to posterior distribution, both encoded as automata. We prove that our approach is sound with respect to a standard operational program semantics.</p></details> |  |

Building on the original Framework for AI-driven Code Generation Evaluation (FACE), the authors retrofit the pipeline to work entirely offline through the Ollama runtime, collapsing FACE's sprawling per-problem directory tree into a handful of consolidated JSON files, and adding robust checkpointing so multi-day runs can resume after failures. The enhanced framework generates, submits, and records solutions for the full Kattis corpus of 3,589 problems across eight code-oriented models ranging from 6.7-9 billion parameters. The submission results show that the overall pass@1 accuracy is modest for the local models, with the best models performing at approximately half the acceptance rate of the proprietary models, Gemini 1.5 and ChatGPT-4. These findings expose a persistent gap between private, cost-controlled LLM deployments and state-of-the-art proprietary services, yet also highlight the rapid progress of open models and the practical benefits of an evaluation workflow that organizations can replicate on in-house hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: 16 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables, accepted to CCSC Eastern 2025</p></details> |

Generating these programs from nonparametric data such as point clouds and meshes remains a crucial yet challenging task, typically requiring extensive manual intervention. Current deep generative models aimed at automating CAD generation are significantly limited by imbalanced and insufficiently large datasets, particularly those lacking representation for complex CAD programs. To address this, we introduce GenCAD-3D, a multimodal generative framework utilizing contrastive learning for aligning latent embeddings between CAD and geometric encoders, combined with latent diffusion models for CAD sequence generation and retrieval. Additionally, we present SynthBal, a synthetic data augmentation strategy specifically designed to balance and expand datasets, notably enhancing representation of complex CAD geometries. Our experiments show that SynthBal significantly boosts reconstruction accuracy, reduces the generation of invalid CAD models, and markedly improves performance on high-complexity geometries, surpassing existing benchmarks. These advancements hold substantial implications for streamlining reverse engineering and enhancing automation in engineering design. We will publicly release our datasets and code, including a set of 51 3D-printed and laser-scanned parts on our project site.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 fig...</summary><p>9 figures, 15 pages.

Recent advances in scaling inference time compute of LLMs have enabled significant progress in generalized scientific discovery. These approaches rely on evolutionary agentic harnesses that leverage LLMs as mutation operators to generate candidate solutions. However, current code evolution methods suffer from critical limitations: they are sample inefficient, requiring thousands of samples to identify effective solutions, and remain closed-source, hindering broad adoption and extension. ShinkaEvolve addresses these limitations, introducing three key innovations: a parent sampling technique balancing exploration and exploitation, code novelty rejection-sampling for efficient search space exploration, and a bandit-based LLM ensemble selection strategy. We evaluate ShinkaEvolve across diverse tasks, demonstrating consistent improvements in sample efficiency and solution quality. ShinkaEvolve discovers a new state-of-the-art circle packing solution using only 150 samples, designs high-performing agentic harnesses for AIME mathematical reasoning tasks, identifies improvements to ALE-Bench competitive programming solutions, and discovers novel mixture-of-expert load balancing loss functions that illuminate the space of optimization strategies. Our results demonstrate that ShinkaEvolve achieves broad applicability with exceptional sample efficiency. By providing open-source accessibility and cost-efficiency, this work democratizes open-ended discovery across diverse computational problems.</p></details> | 52 pages, 14 figures |
| **[Effort-Optimized, Accuracy-Driven Labelling and Validation of Test Inputs for DL Systems: A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04990v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software systems increasingly include AI components based on deep learning (DL). Reliable testing of such systems requires near-perfect test-input validity and label accuracy, with minimal human effort. Yet, the DL community has largely overlooked the need to build highly accurate datasets with minimal effort, since DL training is generally tolerant of labelling errors. This challenge, instead, reflects concerns more familiar to software engineering, where a central goal is to construct high-accuracy test inputs, with accuracy as close to 100% as possible, while keeping associated costs in check. In this article we introduce OPAL, a human-assisted labelling method that can be configured to target a desired accuracy level while minimizing the manual effort required for labelling. The main contribution of OPAL is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that minimizes labelling effort subject to a specified accuracy target. To evaluate OPAL we instantiate it for two tasks in the context of testing vision systems: automatic labelling of test inputs and automated validation of test inputs. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on seven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL, relying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, while cutting manual labelling by more than half. OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in labelling accuracy across all seven datasets, when all methods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated test-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while achieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA test-input validation baselines. Finally, we show that augmenting OPAL with an active-learning loop leads to an additional 4.5% reduction in required manual labelling, without compromising accuracy.</p></details> |  |

We focus on universal PPs featuring sampling from arbitrary measures and conditioning/reweighting in unbounded loops. We first equip Probabilistic Program Graphs (PPGs), an automata-theoretic description format of PPs, with an expectation-based semantics over infinite execution traces, which also incorporates trace weights. We then prove a finite approximation theorem that provides bounds to this semantics based on expectations taken over finite, fixed-length traces. This enables us to frame our semantics within a Feynman-Kac (FK) model, and ensures the consistency of the Particle Filtering (PF) algorithm, an instance of SMC, with respect to our semantics. Building on these results, we introduce VPF, a vectorized version of the PF algorithm tailored to PPGs and our semantics. Experiments conducted with a proof-of-concept implementation of VPF show very promising results compared to state-of-the-art PP inference tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings GandALF 2025, arXiv:2509.13258</p></details> |
| **[Interleaving Natural Language Prompting with Code Editing for Solving Programming Tasks with Generative AI Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14088v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, computing students often rely on both natural-language prompting and manual code editing to solve programming tasks. Yet we still lack a clear understanding of how these two modes are combined in practice, and how their usage varies with task complexity and student ability. In this paper, we investigate this through a large-scale study in an introductory programming course, collecting 13,305 interactions from 355 students during a three-day laboratory activity. Our analysis shows that students primarily use prompting to generate initial solutions, and then often enter short edit-run loops to refine their code following a failed execution. We find that manual editing becomes more frequent as task complexity increases, but most edits remain concise, with many affecting a single line of code. Higher-performing students tend to succeed using prompting alone, while lower-performing students rely more on edits. Student reflections confirm that prompting is helpful for structuring solutions, editing is effective for making targeted corrections, while both are useful for learning. These findings highlight the role of manual editing as a deliberate last-mile repair strategy, complementing prompting in AI-assisted programming workflows.</p></details> |  |

Task and motion planning (TAMP) addresses this by combining symbolic planning and continuous trajectory generation. Recently, foundation model approaches to TAMP have presented impressive results, including fast planning times and the execution of natural language instructions. Yet, the optimal interface between high-level planning and low-level motion generation remains an open question: prior approaches are limited by either too much abstraction (e.g., chaining simplified skill primitives) or a lack thereof (e.g., direct joint angle prediction). Our method introduces a novel technique employing a form of meta-optimization to address these issues by: (i) using program search over trajectory optimization problems as an interface between a foundation model and robot control, and (ii) leveraging a zero-order method to optimize numerical parameters in the foundation model output. Results on challenging object manipulation and drawing tasks confirm that our proposed method improves over prior TAMP approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages main text, 11 pages appendix, accepted at the 9th Annual Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2025)</p></details> |

This course is offered to undergraduate and graduate students during Fall 2024 and Spring 2025. The course began with foundational concepts in GPU/CPU hardware and parallel computing and progressed to develop RAG and optimizing them using GPUs. Students gained experience provisioning and configuring cloud-based GPU instances, implementing parallel algorithms, and deploying scalable AI solutions. We evaluated learning outcomes through assessments, course evaluations, and anonymous surveys. The results reveal that (1) AWS served as an effective and economical platform for practical GPU programming, (2) experiential learning significantly enhanced technical proficiency and engagement, and (3) the course strengthened students' problem-solving and critical thinking skills through tools such as TensorBoard and HPC profilers, which exposed performance bottlenecks and scaling issues. Our findings underscore the pedagogical value of integrating parallel computing into STEM education. We advocate for broader adoption of similar electives across STEM curricula to prepare students for the demands of modern, compute-intensive fields.</p></details> |  |
