| **[Union-Intersection Union-Find for Decoding Depolarizing Errors in Topological Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14745v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the Union-Intersection Union-Find (UIUF) algorithm for decoding depolarizing errors in topological codes, combining the strengths of iterative and standard Union-Find (UF) decoding. While iterative UF improves performance at moderate error rates, it lacks an error correction guarantee. To address this, we develop UIUF, which maintains the enhanced performance of iterative UF while ensuring error correction up to half the code distance. Through simulations under code capacity, phenomenological, and biased noise models, we show that UIUF significantly outperforms UF, reducing the logical error rate by over an order of magnitude (at around $10^{-5}$). Moreover, UIUF achieves lower logical error rates than the Minimum Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder on rotated surface codes under both the code capacity and phenomenological noise models, while preserving efficient linear-time complexity.</p></details> | 13 pages, 17 figures |
| **[Synthesizing Performance Constraints for Evaluating and Improving Code Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23471v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to optimize code efficiency. Evaluating their effectiveness and further suggesting optimization opportunities often rely on high-quality tests to demonstrate the performance bottlenecks presented in the program. However, existing approaches rely on a limited set of hand-curated inputs or LLM-generated uninteresting length-stressing tests, failing to reveal more nuanced optimization opportunities. We present WEDGE, a framework for generating performance-stressing input given the program under test. WEDGE synthesizes explicit performance-characterizing constraints in the form of branch conditions to partition the programs' execution space into performance-specific regions. When integrated with the coverage-guided fuzzer, reaching different regions introduces explicit rewards for test generation to explore inefficient implementations. Our evaluation shows that WEDGE introduces a significant slowdown compared to the tests in CodeContests and those claimed to be optimized by existing approaches. From the utility perspective, integrating our tests substantially improves the existing code optimization approaches that rely on test-driven execution feedback. We release PERFFORGE, the performance tests generated by WEDGE, to benchmark future approaches for efficient code generation at https://github.com/UChiSeclab/perfforge.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Idioms: Neural Decompilation With Joint Code and Type Definition Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.04536v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decompilers are important tools for reverse engineers that help them analyze software at a higher level of abstraction than assembly code. Unfortunately, because compilation is lossy, deterministic decompilers produce code that is missing many of the details that make source code readable in the first place, like variable names and types. Neural decompilers, on the other hand, offer the ability to statistically fill in these details. Existing work in neural decompilation, however, suffers from substantial limitations that preclude its use on real code, such as the inability to define composite types, which is essential to fully specify function semantics. In this work, we introduce a new dataset, Realtype, that includes substantially more complicated and realistic types than existing neural decompilation benchmarks, and Idioms, a new neural decompilation approach to finetune any LLM into a neural decompiler capable of generating the appropriate user-defined type definitions alongside the decompiled code. We show that our approach yields state-of-the-art results in neural decompilation. On the most challenging existing benchmark, ExeBench, our model achieves 54.4% accuracy vs. 46.3% for LLM4Decompile and 37.5% for Nova; on Realtype, our model performs at least 95% better.</p></details> |  |
| **[Issue Retrieval and Verification Enhanced Supplementary Code Comment Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14649v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue reports have been recognized to contain rich information for retrieval-augmented code comment generation. However, how to minimize hallucinations in the generated comments remains significant challenges. In this paper, we propose IsComment, an issue-based LLM retrieval and verification approach for generating method's design rationale, usage directives, and so on as supplementary code comments. We first identify five main types of code supplementary information that issue reports can provide through code-comment-issue analysis. Next, we retrieve issue sentences containing these types of supplementary information and generate candidate code comments. To reduce hallucinations, we filter out those candidate comments that are irrelevant to the code or unverifiable by the issue report, making the code comment generation results more reliable. Our experiments indicate that compared with LLMs, IsComment increases the coverage of manual supplementary comments from 33.6% to 72.2% for ChatGPT, from 35.8% to 88.4% for GPT-4o, and from 35.0% to 86.2% for DeepSeek-V3. Compared with existing work, IsComment can generate richer and more useful supplementary code comments for programming understanding, which is quantitatively evaluated through the MESIA metric on both methods with and without manual code comments.</p></details> | 12 pages, 8 figures |
| **[AIn't Nothing But a Survey? Using Large Language Models for Coding German Open-Ended Survey Responses on Survey Motivation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14634v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The recent development and wider accessibility of LLMs have spurred discussions about how they can be used in survey research, including classifying open-ended survey responses. Due to their linguistic capacities, it is possible that LLMs are an efficient alternative to time-consuming manual coding and the pre-training of supervised machine learning models. As most existing research on this topic has focused on English-language responses relating to non-complex topics or on single LLMs, it is unclear whether its findings generalize and how the quality of these classifications compares to established methods. In this study, we investigate to what extent different LLMs can be used to code open-ended survey responses in other contexts, using German data on reasons for survey participation as an example. We compare several state-of-the-art LLMs and several prompting approaches, and evaluate the LLMs' performance by using human expert codings. Overall performance differs greatly between LLMs, and only a fine-tuned LLM achieves satisfactory levels of predictive performance. Performance differences between prompting approaches are conditional on the LLM used. Finally, LLMs' unequal classification performance across different categories of reasons for survey participation results in different categorical distributions when not using fine-tuning. We discuss the implications of these findings, both for methodological research on coding open-ended responses and for their substantive analysis, and for practitioners processing or substantively analyzing such data. Finally, we highlight the many trade-offs researchers need to consider when choosing automated methods for open-ended response classification in the age of LLMs. In doing so, our study contributes to the growing body of research about the conditions under which LLMs can be efficiently, accurately, and reliably leveraged in survey research.</p></details> | <details><summary>to ap...</summary><p>to appear in Survey Research Methods</p></details> |

Eleven cities in nine countries will deploy in real conditions products and services fostering climate transition in their local environment. The Climaborough City Platform is being developed to monitor the cities' overall progress towards their climate goals by aggregating historic and real-time data and displaying the results in user-friendly dashboards that will be used by non-technical experts to evaluate the effectiveness of local experimental initiatives, identify those that yield significant impact, and assess the potential consequences of scaling them up to a broader level. In this paper, we explain how we have put in place a low-code/no-code strategy in Climaborough in response to the project's aim to quickly deploy climate dashboards. A low-code strategy is used to accelerate the development of the dashboards. The dashboards embed a no-code philosophy that enables all types of citizen profiles to configure and adapt the dashboard to their specific needs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was presented in the Research Projects Track of the 19th International Conference on Research Challenges in Information Science (RCIS 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Automatic Qiskit Code Refactoring Using Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14535v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As quantum software frameworks evolve, developers face increasing challenges in maintaining compatibility with rapidly changing APIs. In this work, we present a novel methodology for refactoring Qiskit code using large language models (LLMs). We begin by extracting a taxonomy of migration scenarios from the different sources of official Qiskit documentation (such as release notes), capturing common patterns such as migration of functionality to different modules and deprecated usage. This taxonomy, along with the original Python source code, is provided as input to an LLM, which is then tasked with identifying instances of migration scenarios in the code and suggesting appropriate refactoring solutions. Our approach is designed to address the context length limitations of current LLMs by structuring the input and reasoning process in a targeted, efficient manner. The results demonstrate that LLMs, when guided by domain-specific migration knowledge, can effectively assist in automating Qiskit code migration. This work contributes both a set of proven prompts and taxonomy for Qiskit code migration from earlier versions to version 0.46 and a methodology to asses the capabilities of LLMs to assist in the migration of quantum code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted for review to "Taller Latinoamericano de Ingenier\'ia de Software Cu\'antico" (https://www.ripaisc.net/call-for-papers-tlisc-2025/)</p></details> |
| **[AST-Enhanced or AST-Overloaded? The Surprising Impact of Hybrid Graph Representations on Code Clone Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14470v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As one of the most detrimental code smells, code clones significantly increase software maintenance costs and heighten vulnerability risks, making their detection a critical challenge in software engineering. Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) dominate deep learning-based code clone detection due to their precise syntactic structure representation, but they inherently lack semantic depth. Recent studies address this by enriching AST-based representations with semantic graphs, such as Control Flow Graphs (CFGs) and Data Flow Graphs (DFGs). However, the effectiveness of various enriched AST-based representations and their compatibility with different graph-based machine learning techniques remains an open question, warranting further investigation to unlock their full potential in addressing the complexities of code clone detection. In this paper, we present a comprehensive empirical study to rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of AST-based hybrid graph representations in Graph Neural Network (GNN)-based code clone detection. We systematically compare various hybrid representations ((CFG, DFG, Flow-Augmented ASTs (FA-AST)) across multiple GNN architectures. Our experiments reveal that hybrid representations impact GNNs differently: while AST+CFG+DFG consistently enhances accuracy for convolution- and attention-based models (Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN), Graph Attention Networks (GAT)), FA-AST frequently introduces structural complexity that harms performance. Notably, GMN outperforms others even with standard AST representations, highlighting its superior cross-code similarity detection and reducing the need for enriched structures.</p></details> |  |
| **[MALSIGHT: Exploring Malicious Source Code and Benign Pseudocode for Iterative Binary Malware Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.18379v3)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary malware summarization aims to automatically generate human-readable descriptions of malware behaviors from executable files, facilitating tasks like malware cracking and detection. Previous methods based on Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great promise. However, they still face significant issues, including poor usability, inaccurate explanations,and incomplete summaries, primarily due to the obscure pseudocode structure and the lack of malware training summaries. Further, calling relationships between functions, which involve the rich interactions within a binary malware, remain largely underexplored. To this end, we propose MALSIGHT, a novel code summarization framework that can iteratively generate descriptions of binary malware by exploring malicious source code and benign pseudocode. Specifically, we construct the first malware summary dataset, MalS and MalP, using an LLM and manually refine this dataset with human effort. At the training stage, we tune our proposed MalT5, a novel LLM-based code model, on the MalS and benign pseudocode datasets. Then, at the test stage, we iteratively feed the pseudocode functions into MalT5 to obtain the summary. Such a procedure facilitates the understanding of pseudocode structure and captures the intricate interactions between functions, thereby benefiting summaries' usability, accuracy, and completeness. Additionally, we propose a novel evaluation benchmark, BLEURT-sum, to measure the quality of summaries. Experiments on three datasets show the effectiveness of the proposed MALSIGHT. Notably, our proposed MalT5, with only 0.77B parameters, delivers comparable performance to much larger Code-Llama.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Information Forensics & Security</p></details> |
| **[AsyncSwitch: Asynchronous Text-Speech Adaptation for Code-Switched ASR](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14190v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing code-switched ASR systems is challenging due to language ambiguity and limited exposure to multilingual, code-switched data, while collecting such speech is costly. Prior work generates synthetic audio from text, but these methods are computationally intensive and hard to scale. We introduce AsyncSwitch, a novel asynchronous adaptation framework that leverages large-scale, text-rich web data to pre-expose ASR models to diverse code-switched domains before fine-tuning on paired speech-text corpora. Our three-stage process (1) trains decoder self-attention and feedforward layers on code-switched text, (2) aligns decoder and encoder via cross-attention using limited speech-text data, and (3) fully fine-tunes the entire model. Experiments with Whisper on Malay-English code-switching demonstrate a 9.02% relative WER reduction, while improving monolingual performance in Singlish, Malay, and other English variants.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted to the IEEE for possible publication.

| **[Can we train ASR systems on Code-switch without real code-switch data? Case study for Singapore's languages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14177v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code-switching (CS), common in multilingual settings, presents challenges for ASR due to scarce and costly transcribed data caused by linguistic complexity. This study investigates building CS-ASR using synthetic CS data. We propose a phrase-level mixing method to generate synthetic CS data that mimics natural patterns. Utilizing monolingual augmented with synthetic phrase-mixed CS data to fine-tune large pretrained ASR models (Whisper, MMS, SeamlessM4T). This paper focuses on three under-resourced Southeast Asian language pairs: Malay-English (BM-EN), Mandarin-Malay (ZH-BM), and Tamil-English (TA-EN), establishing a new comprehensive benchmark for CS-ASR to evaluate the performance of leading ASR models. Experimental results show that the proposed training strategy enhances ASR performance on monolingual and CS tests, with BM-EN showing highest gains, then TA-EN and ZH-BM. This finding offers a cost-effective approach for CS-ASR development, benefiting research and industry.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Interspeech 2025</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Reconciliation of Continuous Variable Quantum Key Distribution with Multiplicatively Repeated Non-Binary LDPC Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11009v2)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Continuous variable quantum key distribution bears the promise of simple quantum key distribution directly compatible with commercial off the shelf equipment. However, for a long time its performance was hindered by the absence of good classical postprocessing capable of distilling secret-keys in the noisy regime. Advanced coding solutions in the past years have partially addressed this problem enabling record transmission distances of up to 165 km, and 206 km over ultra-low loss fiber. In this paper, we show that a very simple coding solution with a single code is sufficient to extract keys at all noise levels. This solution has performance competitive with prior results for all levels of noise, and we show that non-zero keys can be distilled up to a record distance of 192 km assuming the standard loss of a single-mode optical fiber, and 240 km over ultra-low loss fibers. Low-rate codes are constructed using multiplicatively repeated non-binary low-density parity-check codes over a finite field of characteristic two. This construction only makes use of a (2,k)-regular non-binary low-density parity-check code as mother code, such that code design is in fact not required, thus trivializing the code construction procedure. The construction is also inherently rate-adaptive thereby allowing to easily create codes of any rate. Rate-adaptive codes are of special interest for the efficient reconciliation of errors over time or arbitrary varying channels, as is the case with quantum key distribution. In short, these codes are highly efficient when reconciling errors over a very noisy communication channel, and perform well even for short block-length codes. Finally, the proposed solution is known to be easily amenable to hardware implementations, thus addressing also the requirements for practical reconciliation in continuous variable quantum key distribution.</p></details> | 31 pages, 12 figures |
| **[Lost in the Mix: Evaluating LLM Understanding of Code-Switched Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14012v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code-switching (CSW) is the act of alternating between two or more languages within a single discourse. This phenomenon is widespread in multilingual communities, and increasingly prevalent in online content, where users naturally mix languages in everyday communication. As a result, Large Language Models (LLMs), now central to content processing and generation, are frequently exposed to code-switched inputs. Given their widespread use, it is crucial to understand how LLMs process and reason about such mixed-language text. This paper presents a systematic evaluation of LLM comprehension under code-switching by generating CSW variants of established reasoning and comprehension benchmarks. While degradation is evident when foreign tokens disrupt English text$\unicode{x2013}$even under linguistic constraints$\unicode{x2013}$embedding English into other languages often improves comprehension. Though prompting yields mixed results, fine-tuning offers a more stable path to degradation mitigation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Amortized Locally Decodable Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.10538v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Locally Decodable Codes (LDCs) are error correcting codes that admit efficient decoding of individual message symbols without decoding the entire message. Unfortunately, known LDC constructions offer a sub-optimal trade-off between rate, error tolerance and locality, the number of queries that the decoder must make to the received codeword $\tilde {y}$ to recovered a particular symbol from the original message $x$, even in relaxed settings where the encoder/decoder share randomness or where the channel is resource bounded. We initiate the study of Amortized Locally Decodable Codes where the local decoder wants to recover multiple symbols of the original message $x$ and the total number of queries to the received codeword $y$ can be amortized by the total number of message symbols recovered. We demonstrate that amortization allows us to overcome prior barriers and impossibility results. We first demonstrate that the Hadamard code achieves amortized locality below $2$ -- a result that is known to be impossible without amortization. Second, we study amortized locally decodable codes in cryptographic settings where the sender and receiver share a secret key or where the channel is resource-bounded and where the decoder wants to recover a consecutive subset of message symbols $[L,R]$. In these settings we show that it is possible to achieve a trifecta: constant rate, error tolerance and constant amortized locality.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeImprove: Program Adaptation for Deep Code Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15804v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging deep learning (DL)-based code analysis tools to solve software engineering tasks is becoming increasingly popular. Code models often suffer performance degradation due to various reasons (e.g., code data shifts). Retraining is often required to address these issues, but frequent model updates are costly in labeling and deployment. In this paper, we explore an alternative solution: Adapting the program inputs to the code models. This can be achieved by two steps: 1) input validation that focuses on identifying whether an input is an out-of-scope input program that are beyond a model's handling capability, and 2) input adaptation that adapts out-of-scope inputs to become in-scope inputs. Validating program input is challenging, as current techniques focus on continuous inputs such as image data and fail with discrete inputs like code data, which have unique characteristics and are processed differently by deep learning models. Adapting out-of-scope programs is also challenging due to their vast search spaces. Therefore, in this paper, we propose CodeImprove, which distinguishes out-of-scope from normal inputs and converts such out-of-scope inputs back to in-scope inputs through program transformation. In particular, we propose a validity score metric to identify out-of-scope inputs and leverage genetic algorithms to apply semantic preserving program transformation to convert out-of-scope inputs to in-scope inputs. Our experimental results show CodeImprove can enhance up to 8.78% of accuracy, and 51.28% of relative improvements in three code models on two SE tasks. Additionally, our input validation is promising in detecting out-of-scope inputs (AUC score of 0.924).</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 47th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2025)</p></details> |
| **[LongCodeBench: Evaluating Coding LLMs at 1M Context Windows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.07897v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context lengths for models have grown rapidly, from thousands to millions of tokens in just a few years. The extreme context sizes of modern long-context models have made it difficult to construct realistic long-context benchmarks -- not only due to the cost of collecting million-context tasks but also in identifying realistic scenarios that require significant contexts. We identify code comprehension and repair as a natural testbed and challenge task for long-context models and introduce LongCodeBench (LCB), a benchmark to test LLM coding abilities in long-context scenarios. Our benchmark tests both the comprehension and repair capabilities of LCLMs in realistic and important settings by drawing from real-world GitHub issues and constructing QA (LongCodeQA) and bug fixing (LongSWE-Bench) tasks. We carefully stratify the complexity of our benchmark, enabling us to evaluate models across different scales -- ranging from Qwen2.5 14B Instruct to Google's flagship Gemini model. We find that long-context remains a weakness for all models, with performance drops such as from 29% to 3% for Claude 3.5 Sonnet, or from 70.2% to 40% for Qwen2.5.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Does LLM Reasoning Work for Code? A Survey and a Call to Action](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13932v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) has led to dramatic improvements across a wide range of natural language tasks. These advancements have extended into the domain of code, facilitating complex tasks such as code generation, translation, summarization, and repair. However, their utility for real-world deployment in-the-wild has only recently been studied, particularly on software engineering (SWE) tasks such as GitHub issue resolution. In this study, we examine the code reasoning techniques that underlie the ability to perform such tasks, and examine the paradigms used to drive their performance. Our contributions in this paper are: (1) the first dedicated survey on code reasoning for code tasks, highlighting overarching strategies, hybrid and agentic approaches; (2) a taxonomy of various techniques used to drive code reasoning; (3) a comprehensive overview of performance on common benchmarks and a showcase of new, under-explored benchmarks with high potential in SWE; (4) an exploration on how core properties of code can be used to explain different reasoning techniques; and (5) gaps and potentially under-explored areas for future research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spec2RTL-Agent: Automated Hardware Code Generation from Complex Specifications Using LLM Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13905v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress in generating hardware RTL code with LLMs, existing solutions still suffer from a substantial gap between practical application scenarios and the requirements of real-world RTL code development. Prior approaches either focus on overly simplified hardware descriptions or depend on extensive human guidance to process complex specifications, limiting their scalability and automation potential. In this paper, we address this gap by proposing an LLM agent system, termed Spec2RTL-Agent, designed to directly process complex specification documentation and generate corresponding RTL code implementations, advancing LLM-based RTL code generation toward more realistic application settings. To achieve this goal, Spec2RTL-Agent introduces a novel multi-agent collaboration framework that integrates three key enablers: (1) a reasoning and understanding module that translates specifications into structured, step-by-step implementation plans; (2) a progressive coding and prompt optimization module that iteratively refines the code across multiple representations to enhance correctness and synthesisability for RTL conversion; and (3) an adaptive reflection module that identifies and traces the source of errors during generation, ensuring a more robust code generation flow. Instead of directly generating RTL from natural language, our system strategically generates synthesizable C++ code, which is then optimized for HLS. This agent-driven refinement ensures greater correctness and compatibility compared to naive direct RTL generation approaches. We evaluate Spec2RTL-Agent on three specification documents, showing it generates accurate RTL code with up to 75% fewer human interventions than existing methods. This highlights its role as the first fully automated multi-agent system for RTL generation from unstructured specs, reducing reliance on human effort in hardware design.</p></details> |  |

The encryption engine features a dynamic ShiftRows operation controlled by a logistic map, variable S-boxes generated from a two-dimensional Henon map for substitution and key expansion, and feedback chaining with post-encryption XOR diffusion to improve confusion, diffusion, and key sensitivity. To address secure key delivery, the scheme introduces dual-key distribution via steganographically modified QR codes. A static key and an AES-encrypted dynamic session key are embedded with a covert hint message using least significant bit (LSB) steganography. This design ensures the dynamic key can only be decrypted after reconstructing the static key from the hidden message, offering multi-factor protection against interception. Experimental results demonstrate the framework outperforms existing chaos-based and hybrid AES methods, achieving near-ideal entropy (7.997), minimal pixel correlation, and strong differential resistance with NPCR (>99.6%) and UACI (50.1%). Encrypted images show uniform histograms and robustness against noise and data loss. The framework offers a scalable, secure solution for sensitive image transmission in applications such as surveillance, medical imaging, and digital forensics, bridging the gap between cryptographic strength and safe key distribution.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages (including references), 14 figures.

| **[Cache-Aided Variable-Length Coding with Perfect Privacy](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.13184v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A cache-aided compression problem with perfect privacy is studied, where a server has access to a database of $N$ files, $(Y_1,...,Y_N)$, each of size $F$ bits. The server is connected to $K$ users through a shared link, where each user has access to a local cache of size $MF$ bits. In the placement phase, the server fills the users$'$ caches without prior knowledge of their future demands, while the delivery phase takes place after the users send their demands to the server. We assume that each file $Y_i$ is arbitrarily correlated with a private attribute $X$, and an adversary is assumed to have access to the shared link. The users and the server have access to a shared secret key $W$. The goal is to design the cache contents and the delivered message $\cal C$ such that the average length of $\mathcal{C}$ is minimized, while satisfying: i. The response $\cal C$ does not disclose any information about $X$, i.e., $X$ and $\cal C$ are statistically independent yielding $I(X;\mathcal{C})=0$, which corresponds to the perfect privacy constraint; ii. User $i$ is able to decode its demand, $Y_{d_i}$, by using its local cache $Z_i$, delivered message $\cal C$, and the shared secret key $W$. Due to the correlation of database with the private attribute, existing codes for cache-aided delivery do not fulfill the perfect privacy constraint. Indeed, in this work, we propose a lossless variable-length coding scheme that combines privacy-aware compression with coded caching techniques. In particular, we use two-part code construction and Functional Representation Lemma. Furthermore, we propose an alternative coding scheme based on the minimum entropy coupling concept and a greedy entropy-based algorithm. We show that the proposed scheme improves the previous results obtained by Functional Representation Lemma.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unifying Uniform and Binary-coding Quantization for Accurate Compression of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03781v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>How can we quantize large language models while preserving accuracy? Quantization is essential for deploying large language models (LLMs) efficiently. Binary-coding quantization (BCQ) and uniform quantization (UQ) are promising quantization schemes that have strong expressiveness and optimizability, respectively. However, neither scheme leverages both advantages. In this paper, we propose UniQuanF (Unified Quantization with Flexible Mapping), an accurate quantization method for LLMs. UniQuanF harnesses both strong expressiveness and optimizability by unifying the flexible mapping technique in UQ and non-uniform quantization levels of BCQ. We propose unified initialization, and local and periodic mapping techniques to optimize the parameters in UniQuanF precisely. After optimization, our unification theorem removes computational and memory overhead, allowing us to utilize the superior accuracy of UniQuanF without extra deployment costs induced by the unification. Experimental results demonstrate that UniQuanF outperforms existing UQ and BCQ methods, achieving up to 4.60% higher accuracy on GSM8K benchmark.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Main Track |
| **[DesignCoder: Hierarchy-Aware and Self-Correcting UI Code Generation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13663v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have streamlined front-end interface development by automating code generation. However, these models also introduce challenges in ensuring code quality. Existing approaches struggle to maintain both visual consistency and functional completeness in the generated components. Moreover, they lack mechanisms to assess the fidelity and correctness of the rendered pages. To address these issues, we propose DesignCoder, a novel hierarchical-aware and self-correcting automated code generation framework. Specifically, we introduce UI Grouping Chains, which enhance MLLMs' capability to understand and predict complex nested UI hierarchies. Subsequently, DesignCoder employs a hierarchical divide-and-conquer approach to generate front-end code. Finally, we incorporate a self-correction mechanism to improve the model's ability to identify and rectify errors in the generated code. Extensive evaluations on a dataset of UI mockups collected from both open-source communities and industry projects demonstrate that DesignCoder outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in React Native, a widely adopted UI framework. Our method achieves a 37.63%, 9.52%, 12.82% performance increase in visual similarity metrics (MSE, CLIP, SSIM) and significantly improves code structure similarity in terms of TreeBLEU, Container Match, and Tree Edit Distance by 30.19%, 29.31%, 24.67%. Furthermore, we conducted a user study with professional developers to assess the quality and practicality of the generated code. Results indicate that DesignCoder aligns with industry best practices, demonstrating high usability, readability, and maintainability. Our approach provides an efficient and practical solution for agile front-end development, enabling development teams to focus more on core functionality and product innovation.</p></details> | 11 pages,6 figures |
| **[Dynamic Layered Decoding Scheduling for LDPC Codes Aided by Check Node Error Probabilities](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13507v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, a new scheduling strategies for low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes under layered belief propagation (LBP) is designed. Based on the criteria of prioritizing the update of check nodes with lower error probabilities, we propose two dynamic scheduling methods: dynamic error belief propagation (Dyn-EBP) and dynamic penalty error belief propagation (Dyn-PEBP). In Dyn-EBP, each check node is restricted from being updated the same number of times, whereas Dyn-PEBP removes this restriction and instead introduces a penalty term to balance the number of updates. Simulation results show that, for 5G new radio (NR) LDPC codes, our proposed scheduling methods can outperform existing dynamic and offline scheduling strategies under various blocklengths and code rates. This demonstrates that prioritizing the update of check nodes with lower error probabilities can lead to higher decoding efficiency and validates the effectiveness of our algorithms.</p></details> | 5 pages, 4 figures |

Superimposed codes are foundational combinatorial tools with applications in areas ranging from distributed computing and data retrieval to fault-tolerant communication. However, classical superimposed codes rely on strict alignment assumptions, limiting their effectiveness in asynchronous and fault-prone environments, which are common in modern systems and applications. We introduce Ultra-Resilient Superimposed Codes (URSCs), a new class of codes that extends the classic superimposed framework by ensuring a stronger codewords' isolation property and resilience to two types of adversarial perturbations: arbitrary cyclic shifts and partial bitwise corruption (flips). Additionally, URSCs exhibit universality, adapting seamlessly to any number $k$ of concurrent codewords without prior knowledge. This is a combination of properties not achieved in any previous construction. We provide the first polynomial-time construction of URSCs with near-optimal length, significantly outperforming previous constructions with less general features, all without requiring prior knowledge of the number of concurrent codewords, $k$. % We demonstrate that our URSCs significantly advance the state of the art in multiple applications, including uncoordinated beeping networks, where our codes reduce time complexity for local broadcast by nearly two orders of magnitude, and generalized contention resolution in multi-access channel communication.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces a generalizable approach that uses small-scale code versions of the Qwen 2.5 model combined with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) to enable effective code generation through explicit reasoning steps, which is particularly beneficial for languages with smaller source code databases. Using Prolog as a representative use case -- given its limited online presence -- the initial model faced challenges in generating executable code. After some training steps, the model successfully produces logically consistent and syntactically accurate code by directly integrating reasoning-driven feedback into the reinforcement learning loop. Experimental evaluations using mathematical logic problem benchmarks illustrate significant improvements in reasoning quality, code accuracy, and logical correctness, underscoring the potential of this approach to benefit a wide range of programming languages lacking extensive training resources.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

We begin by curating the SFT training data through two scaling strategies: increasing the number of collected prompts and the number of generated responses per prompt. Both approaches yield notable improvements in reasoning performance, with scaling the number of prompts resulting in more substantial gains. We then explore the following questions regarding the synergy between SFT and RL: (i) Does a stronger SFT model consistently lead to better final performance after large-scale RL training? (ii) How can we determine an appropriate sampling temperature during RL training to effectively balance exploration and exploitation for a given SFT initialization? Our findings suggest that (i) holds true, provided effective RL training is conducted, particularly when the sampling temperature is carefully chosen to maintain the temperature-adjusted entropy around 0.3, a setting that strikes a good balance between exploration and exploitation. Notably, the performance gap between initial SFT models narrows significantly throughout the RL process. Leveraging a strong SFT foundation and insights into the synergistic interplay between SFT and RL, our AceReason-Nemotron-1.1 7B model significantly outperforms AceReason-Nemotron-1.0 and achieves new state-of-the-art performance among Qwen2.5-7B-based reasoning models on challenging math and code benchmarks, thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of our post-training recipe.

Current methods primarily focus on correctness, often overlooking efficiency. To address this gap, we introduce EffiCoder to improve both aspects by fine-tuning LLMs on a high-quality dataset comprising correct and efficient code samples. Our methodology involves leveraging multiple LLMs to generate diverse candidate code solutions for various tasks across different programming languages. We then evaluate these solutions by measuring their execution time and memory usage through local execution. The code solution with the lowest execution time and memory consumption is selected as the final output for each task. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements when fine-tuning with Effi-Instruct. For instance, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B-Instruct's pass@1 score increases from 44.8\% to 57.7\%, while the average execution time for correct tasks decreases by 48.4\%. EffiCoder offers a scalable and effective solution for advancing AI-driven code generation, benefiting software development and computational problem-solving.

However, there is limited understanding of how screen reader users engage with these systems in practice. To address this gap, we conducted a longitudinal study with 16 screen reader users, exploring their experiences with AI code assistants in daily programming scenarios. Participants first completed a tutorial with GitHub Copilot, then performed a programming task and provided initial feedback. After two weeks of AI-assisted programming, follow-up studies assessed changes in their practices and perceptions. Our findings demonstrate that advanced code assistants not only enhance their programming capabilities but also bridge accessibility gaps. While the assistant proved beneficial, there remains potential to improve how users convey intent and interpret outputs. They also experienced difficulties managing multiple views and maintaining situational awareness. More broadly, they encountered barriers in learning advanced tools and expressed a need to retain control. Based on these insights, we provide design recommendations for more accessible and inclusive AI-assisted tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Spectral Comb Shaping by Polar Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13230v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A scheme to select information indices in polar codes is proposed to form signals with spectral comb shapes under BPSK modulation, whereby the signal could be separated from periodic interference in spectrum. By selecting proper indices to load information bits in polar coding, a spectral comb shape signal is formed, which has periodic zeros and notch bands uniformly distributed in its frequency spectrum. Furthermore, to mitigate the negative impact of proposed polar code on the AWGN performance, a scheme termed error performance enhancement scheme is proposed, whereby the performance loss under AWGN noise could be alleviated. Numerical results are given under periodic interference and AWGN noise, indicating that a considerable signal-to-noise power ratio (SNR) gain is accomplished in comparison with conventional polar codes.</p></details> | 11 pages, 8 figures |

AlphaEvolve orchestrates an autonomous pipeline of LLMs, whose task is to improve an algorithm by making direct changes to the code. Using an evolutionary approach, continuously receiving feedback from one or more evaluators, AlphaEvolve iteratively improves the algorithm, potentially leading to new scientific and practical discoveries. We demonstrate the broad applicability of this approach by applying it to a number of important computational problems. When applied to optimizing critical components of large-scale computational stacks at Google, AlphaEvolve developed a more efficient scheduling algorithm for data centers, found a functionally equivalent simplification in the circuit design of hardware accelerators, and accelerated the training of the LLM underpinning AlphaEvolve itself. Furthermore, AlphaEvolve discovered novel, provably correct algorithms that surpass state-of-the-art solutions on a spectrum of problems in mathematics and computer science, significantly expanding the scope of prior automated discovery methods (Romera-Paredes et al., 2023). Notably, AlphaEvolve developed a search algorithm that found a procedure to multiply two $4 \times 4$ complex-valued matrices using $48$ scalar multiplications; offering the first improvement, after 56 years, over Strassen's algorithm in this setting. We believe AlphaEvolve and coding agents like it can have a significant impact in improving solutions of problems across many areas of science and computation.</p></details> |  |

Current solutions predominantly rely on proprietary LLM agents, which introduce unpredictability and limit accessibility, raising concerns about data privacy and model customization. This paper investigates whether open-source LLMs can effectively address repository-level tasks without requiring agent-based approaches. We demonstrate this is possible by enabling LLMs to comprehend functions and files within codebases through their semantic information and structural dependencies. To this end, we introduce Code Graph Models (CGMs), which integrate repository code graph structures into the LLM's attention mechanism and map node attributes to the LLM's input space using a specialized adapter. When combined with an agentless graph RAG framework, our approach achieves a 43.00% resolution rate on the SWE-bench Lite benchmark using the open-source Qwen2.5-72B model. This performance ranks first among open weight models, second among methods with open-source systems, and eighth overall, surpassing the previous best open-source model-based method by 12.33%.</p></details> | 31 pages, 9 figures |

These credentials create attack surfaces exploitable by a potential adversary to conduct malicious exploits such as backdoor attacks. Recent detection efforts utilize embedding models to vectorize textual credentials before passing them to classifiers for predictions. However, these models struggle to discriminate between credentials with contextual and complex sequences resulting in high false positive predictions. Context-dependent Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) or Large Language Models (LLMs) such as Generative Pre-trained Transformers (GPT) tackled this drawback by leveraging the transformer neural architecture capacity for self-attention to capture contextual dependencies between words in input sequences. As a result, GPT has achieved wide success in several natural language understanding endeavors. Hence, we assess LLMs to represent these observations and feed extracted embedding vectors to a deep learning classifier to detect hard-coded credentials. Our model outperforms the current state-of-the-art by 13% in F1 measure on the benchmark dataset. We have made all source code and data publicly available to facilitate the reproduction of all results presented in this paper.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the ACM Digital Threats: Research and Practice (DTRAP)</p></details> |

Our main contribution is establishing a trade-off between the error-correction capability of the code, the number of reads used in the reconstruction process, and the decoding list size. We show that over a channel that introduces at most $t$ bursts, we can use a length-$n$ code capable of correcting $\epsilon$ errors, with $\Theta(n^\rho)$ reads, and decoding with a list of size $O(n^\lambda)$, where $t-1=\epsilon+\rho+\lambda$. In the process of proving this, we establish sharp asymptotic bounds on the size of error balls in the burst metric. More precisely, we prove a Johnson-type lower bound via Kahn's Theorem on large matchings in hypergraphs, and an upper bound via a novel variant of Kleitman's Theorem under the burst metric, which might be of independent interest. Beyond this main trade-off, we derive several related results using a variety of combinatorial techniques. In particular, along with tools from recent advances in discrete geometry, we improve the classical Gilbert-Varshamov bound in the asymptotic regime for multiple bursts, and determine the minimum redundancy required for reconstruction codes with polynomially many reads. We also propose an efficient list-reconstruction algorithm that achieves the above guarantees, based on a majority-with-threshold decoding scheme.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kelly Bets and Single-Letter Codes: Optimal Information Processing in Natural Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2104.14277v2)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an information-processing investment game, such as the growth of a population of organisms in a changing environment, Kelly betting maximizes the expected log rate of growth. In this paper, we show that Kelly bets are closely related to optimal single-letter codes (i.e., they can achieve the rate-distortion bound with equality). Thus, natural information processing systems with limited computational resources can achieve information-theoretically optimal performance. We show that the rate-distortion tradeoff for an investment game has a simple linear bound, and that the bound is achievable at the point where the corresponding single-letter code is optimal. This interpretation has two interesting consequences. First, we show that increasing the organism's portfolio of potential strategies can lead to optimal performance over a continuous range of channels, even if the strategy portfolio is fixed. Second, we show that increasing an organism's number of phenotypes (i.e., its number of possible behaviours in response to the environment) can lead to higher growth rate, and we give conditions under which this occurs. Examples illustrating the results in simplified biological scenarios are presented.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Molecular, Biological, and Multi-Scale Communications</p></details> |

However, privacy and computational requirements are problematic with commercial solutions and the use of LLMs. In this work, we focus on using relatively small and efficient LLMs with 160M parameters that are suitable for local execution and augmentation with retrieval from local projects. We train two open transformer-based models, the generative GPT-2 and the retrieval-adapted RETRO, on open-source Python files, and empirically compare them, confirming the benefits of embedding-based retrieval. Furthermore, we improve our models' performance with In-context retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), which retrieves code snippets using the Jaccard similarity of tokens. We evaluate In-context RAG on larger models and determine that, despite its simplicity, the approach is more suitable than using the RETRO architecture. Experimental results indicate that In-context RAG improves the code completion baseline by over 26%, while RETRO improves over the similarly sized GPT-2 baseline by 12%. We highlight the key role of proper tokenization in achieving the full potential of LLMs in code completion.</p></details> | <details><summary>30 pa...</summary><p>30 pages, 15 figures; Accepted manuscript for Expert Systems with Applications</p></details> |

While remarkable success has been made in the era of large language models (LLMs), current research still focuses on the simple no-library or single-library setting, ignoring the complex multi-library scenario in real-world applications. To address this limitation, we make the first attempt to introduce MLDebugging (Multi-Library Debugging), a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess debugging challenges within multi-library Python code. Specifically, MLDebugging encompasses 126 distinct Python libraries, covering a wide range of multi-library code issues, categorized into seven distinct types. Furthermore, we conduct a thorough evaluation of MLDebugging using both mainstream open-source and closed-source LLMs and highlight that current LLMs still struggle to correctly perform code debugging across multi-library scenarios. We hope this work can uncover the potential of LLMs in multi-library debugging scenario and offer insights for future research.</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |

This paper investigates the efficacy of various AI paradigms in mastering this game. We develop and evaluate three distinct agent architectures: a Transformer-based baseline model with limited historical context, several Large Language Model (LLM) agents (including Gemini, DeepSeek, and GPT variants) guided by structured prompts, and an agent based on Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) employing a Transformer encoder for comprehensive game history processing. Performance is benchmarked against the baseline, with the PPO-based agent demonstrating superior win rates ($58.5\% \pm 1.0\%$), significantly outperforming the LLM counterparts. Our analysis highlights the strengths of deep reinforcement learning in policy refinement for complex deductive tasks, particularly in learning implicit strategies from self-play. We also examine the capabilities and inherent limitations of current LLMs in maintaining strict logical consistency and strategic depth over extended gameplay, despite sophisticated prompting. This study contributes to the broader understanding of AI in recreational games involving hidden information and multi-step logical reasoning, offering insights into effective agent design and the comparative advantages of different AI approaches.</p></details> |  |

However, prior research has largely overlooked the security risks inherent in the generated code. In this work, we introduce SafeGenBench, a benchmark specifically designed to assess the security of LLM-generated code. The dataset encompasses a wide range of common software development scenarios and vulnerability types. Building upon this benchmark, we develop an automatic evaluation framework that leverages both static application security testing(SAST) and LLM-based judging to assess the presence of security vulnerabilities in model-generated code. Through the empirical evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs on SafeGenBench, we reveal notable deficiencies in their ability to produce vulnerability-free code. Our findings highlight pressing challenges and offer actionable insights for future advancements in the secure code generation performance of LLMs. The data and code will be released soon.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing methods are architecture-specific, targeting either CNNs or Transformers. This design limits their applicability in real-world scenarios where features from both architectures coexist. To address this gap, we introduce a new research problem: cross-architecture universal feature coding (CAUFC), which seeks to build a unified codec that can effectively compress features from heterogeneous architectures. To tackle this challenge, we propose a two-step distribution alignment method. First, we design the format alignment method that unifies CNN and Transformer features into a consistent 2D token format. Second, we propose the feature value alignment method that harmonizes statistical distributions via truncation and normalization. As a first attempt to study CAUFC, we evaluate our method on the image classification task. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves superior rate-accuracy trade-offs compared to the architecture-specific baseline. This work marks an initial step toward universal feature compression across heterogeneous model architectures.</p></details> |  |

As part of HLCE, we design a harmonized online-offline sandbox that guarantees fully reproducible evaluation. Through our comprehensive evaluation, we observe that even the strongest reasoning LLMs: o4-mini(high) and Gemini-2.5 Pro, achieve pass@1 rates of only 15.9% and 11.4%, respectively. Meanwhile, we propose a novel "self-recognition" task to measure LLMs' awareness of their own capabilities. Results indicate that LLMs' self-recognition abilities are not proportionally correlated with their code generation performance. Finally, our empirical validation of test-time scaling laws reveals that current advanced LLMs have substantial room for improvement on complex programming tasks. We expect HLCE to become a milestone challenge for code generation and to catalyze advances in high-performance reasoning and human-AI collaborative programming. Our code and dataset are also public available(https://github.com/Humanity-s-Last-Code-Exam/HLCE).</p></details> |  |

| **[Context-Augmented Code Generation Using Programming Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18251v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Code-LLMs (CLLMs) have significantly improved code generation, but, they frequently face difficulties when dealing with challenging and complex problems. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by retrieving and integrating external knowledge at the inference time. However, retrieval models often fail to find most relevant context, and generation models, with limited context capacity, can hallucinate when given irrelevant data. We present a novel framework that leverages a Programming Knowledge Graph (PKG) to semantically represent and retrieve code. This approach enables fine-grained code retrieval by focusing on the most relevant segments while reducing irrelevant context through a tree-pruning technique. PKG is coupled with a re-ranking mechanism to reduce even more hallucinations by selectively integrating non-RAG solutions. We propose two retrieval approaches-block-wise and function-wise-based on the PKG, optimizing context granularity. Evaluations on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks show our method improves pass@1 accuracy by up to 20%, and outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 34% on MBPP. Our contributions include PKG-based retrieval, tree pruning to enhance retrieval precision, a re-ranking method for robust solution selection and a Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) enhancer module for automatic code augmentation with relevant comments and docstrings.</p></details> | 20 pages, Conference |
| **[Fast Point Cloud Geometry Compression with Context-based Residual Coding and INR-based Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02966v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compressing a set of unordered points is far more challenging than compressing images/videos of regular sample grids, because of the difficulties in characterizing neighboring relations in an irregular layout of points. Many researchers resort to voxelization to introduce regularity, but this approach suffers from quantization loss. In this research, we use the KNN method to determine the neighborhoods of raw surface points. This gives us a means to determine the spatial context in which the latent features of 3D points are compressed by arithmetic coding. As such, the conditional probability model is adaptive to local geometry, leading to significant rate reduction. Additionally, we propose a dual-layer architecture where a non-learning base layer reconstructs the main structures of the point cloud at low complexity, while a learned refinement layer focuses on preserving fine details. This design leads to reductions in model complexity and coding latency by two orders of magnitude compared to SOTA methods. Moreover, we incorporate an implicit neural representation (INR) into the refinement layer, allowing the decoder to sample points on the underlying surface at arbitrary densities. This work is the first to effectively exploit content-aware local contexts for compressing irregular raw point clouds, achieving high rate-distortion performance, low complexity, and the ability to function as an arbitrary-scale upsampling network simultaneously.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECCV 2024.

| **[A Fast, Reliable, and Secure Programming Language for LLM Agents with Code Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12202v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern large language models (LLMs) are often deployed as agents, calling external tools adaptively to solve tasks. Rather than directly calling tools, it can be more effective for LLMs to write code to perform the tool calls, enabling them to automatically generate complex control flow such as conditionals and loops. Such code actions are typically provided as Python code, since LLMs are quite proficient at it; however, Python may not be the ideal language due to limited built-in support for performance, security, and reliability. We propose a novel programming language for code actions, called Quasar, which has several benefits: (1) automated parallelization to improve performance, (2) uncertainty quantification to improve reliability and mitigate hallucinations, and (3) security features enabling the user to validate actions. LLMs can write code in a subset of Python, which is automatically transpiled to Quasar. We evaluate our approach on the ViperGPT visual question answering agent, applied to the GQA dataset, demonstrating that LLMs with Quasar actions instead of Python actions retain strong performance, while reducing execution time when possible by 42%, improving security by reducing user approval interactions when possible by 52%, and improving reliability by applying conformal prediction to achieve a desired target coverage level.</p></details> |  |

With the rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs), code generation capabilities have begun to significantly reshape programming practices. This development prompts a central question: Have LLMs transformed code style, and how can such transformation be characterized? In this paper, we present a pioneering study that investigates the impact of LLMs on code style, with a focus on naming conventions, complexity, maintainability, and similarity. By analyzing code from over 19,000 GitHub repositories linked to arXiv papers published between 2020 and 2025, we identify measurable trends in the evolution of coding style that align with characteristics of LLM-generated code. For instance, the proportion of snake\_case variable names in Python code increased from 47% in Q1 2023 to 51% in Q1 2025. Furthermore, we investigate how LLMs approach algorithmic problems by examining their reasoning processes. Given the diversity of LLMs and usage scenarios, among other factors, it is difficult or even impossible to precisely estimate the proportion of code generated or assisted by LLMs. Our experimental results provide the first large-scale empirical evidence that LLMs affect real-world programming style.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We release all the experimental dataset and source code at: https://github.com/ignorancex/LLM_code</p></details> |
| **[Black-Box Adversarial Attacks on LLM-Based Code Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.02509v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern code completion engines, powered by large language models (LLMs), assist millions of developers with their strong capabilities to generate functionally correct code. Due to this popularity, it is crucial to investigate the security implications of relying on LLM-based code completion. In this work, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art black-box LLM-based code completion engines can be stealthily biased by adversaries to significantly increase their rate of insecure code generation. We present the first attack, named INSEC, that achieves this goal. INSEC works by injecting an attack string as a short comment in the completion input. The attack string is crafted through a query-based optimization procedure starting from a set of carefully designed initialization schemes. We demonstrate INSEC's broad applicability and effectiveness by evaluating it on various state-of-the-art open-source models and black-box commercial services (e.g., OpenAI API and GitHub Copilot). On a diverse set of security-critical test cases, covering 16 CWEs across 5 programming languages, INSEC increases the rate of generated insecure code by more than 50%, while maintaining the functional correctness of generated code. We consider INSEC practical -- it requires low resources and costs less than 10 US dollars to develop on commodity hardware. Moreover, we showcase the attack's real-world deployability, by developing an IDE plug-in that stealthily injects INSEC into the GitHub Copilot extension.</p></details> |  |

However, employing tools like GeoPandas, a prominent Python library for geospatial data manipulation, necessitates expertise in complex domain-specific syntax and workflows. GeoPandas-AI addresses this gap by integrating LLMs directly into the GeoPandas workflow, transforming the GeoDataFrame class into an intelligent, stateful class for both data analysis and geospatial code development. This paper formalizes the design of such a smart class and provides an open-source implementation of GeoPandas-AI in PyPI package manager. Through its innovative combination of conversational interfaces and stateful exploitation of LLMs for code generation and data analysis, GeoPandas-AI introduces a new paradigm for code-copilots and instantiates it for geospatial development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ACM SIGSPATIAL 2025</p></details> |

Specifically, function-level diffing tools are the most widely used in BCSA: they perform function matching one by one for evaluating the similarity between binary programs. However, such methods need a high time complexity, making them unscalable in large-scale scenarios (e.g., 1/n-to-n search). Towards effective and efficient program-level BCSA, we propose KEENHash, a novel hashing approach that hashes binaries into program-level representations through large language model (LLM)-generated function embeddings. KEENHash condenses a binary into one compact and fixed-length program embedding using K-Means and Feature Hashing, allowing us to do effective and efficient large-scale program-level BCSA, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that KEENHash is at least 215 times faster than the state-of-the-art function matching tools while maintaining effectiveness. Furthermore, in a large-scale scenario with 5.3 billion similarity evaluations, KEENHash takes only 395.83 seconds while these tools will cost at least 56 days. We also evaluate KEENHash on the program clone search of large-scale BCSA across extensive datasets in 202,305 binaries. Compared with 4 state-of-the-art methods, KEENHash outperforms all of them by at least 23.16%, and displays remarkable superiority over them in the large-scale BCSA security scenario of malware detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Retrieval-Augmented Code Review Comment Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11591v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code review comment generation (RCG) aims to assist developers by automatically producing natural language feedback for code changes. Existing approaches are primarily either generation-based, using pretrained language models, or information retrieval-based (IR), reusing comments from similar past examples. While generation-based methods leverage code-specific pretraining on large code-natural language corpora to learn semantic relationships between code and natural language, they often struggle to generate low-frequency but semantically important tokens due to their probabilistic nature. In contrast, IR-based methods excel at recovering such rare tokens by copying from existing examples but lack flexibility in adapting to new code contexts-for example, when input code contains identifiers or structures not found in the retrieval database. To bridge the gap between generation-based and IR-based methods, this work proposes to leverage retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) for RCG by conditioning pretrained language models on retrieved code-review exemplars. By providing relevant examples that illustrate how similar code has been previously reviewed, the model is better guided to generate accurate review comments. Our evaluation on the Tufano et al. benchmark shows that RAG-based RCG outperforms both generation-based and IR-based RCG. It achieves up to +1.67% higher exact match and +4.25% higher BLEU scores compared to generation-based RCG. It also improves the generation of low-frequency ground-truth tokens by up to 24.01%. We additionally find that performance improves as the number of retrieved exemplars increases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Last-Pair Swapping Polar Codes: A Structure to Improve Polarization on Channels with Memory](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11535v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A new structure of polar codes is proposed for channels with memory to improve polarization and approach the polarization efficiency of conventional polar codes on memoryless channels. We classify trellis channels, a particular type of finite state channels into two categories, called sub-injective trellis channels and non-sub-injective trellis channels, where an explicit polarization loss is observed on the former. For sub-injective trellis channels, we substitute the last kernel of each layer in polar coding structure by a swapping matrix, thus leading to our proposed coding structure named last-pair swapping structure. Simulation shows on sub-injective trellis channels polarization efficiency of the proposed polar code exceeds that of conventional one. Furthermore, we point out a special type of sub-injective trellis channels, called bijective trellis channels, and indicate on them the proposed structure achieves identical polarization efficiency with that of conventional one on memoryless channels, which is later theoretically proved. Moreover, limit of the proposed structure is also analyzed. Simulation results of error rate are given on continuous phase modulation (CPM) with additional white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, showing a considerable signal-to-noise power ratio (snr) gain of the proposed polar code over conventional one, and identical performances between the proposed polar code on bijective trellis channels and conventional one on memoryless channels.</p></details> | 23 pages, 15 figures |
| **[How Well Do Large Language Models Serve as End-to-End Secure Code Agents for Python?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.10495v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 has revolutionized the landscape of software engineering, positioning these models at the core of modern development practices. As we anticipate these models to evolve into the primary and trustworthy tools used in software development, ensuring the security of the code they produce becomes paramount. How well can LLMs serve as end-to-end secure code producers? This paper presents a systematic investigation into LLMs' inherent potential to generate code with fewer vulnerabilities. Specifically, We studied GPT-3.5 and GPT-4's capability to identify and repair vulnerabilities in the code generated by four popular LLMs including themselves (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Code Llama, and CodeGeeX2). By manually or automatically reviewing 4,900 pieces of code, our study reveals that: (1) large language models lack awareness of scenario-relevant security risks, which leads to the generation of over 75% vulnerable code on the SecurityEval benchmark; (2) LLMs such as GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are unable to precisely identify vulnerabilities in the code they generated; (3) GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can achieve 33.2%~59.6% success rates in repairing the insecure code produced by the 4 LLMs, but they both perform poorly when repairing self-produced code, indicating self-repair "blind spots". To address the limitation of a single round of repair, we developed a lightweight tool that prompts LLMs to construct safer source code through an iterative repair procedure based on the insights gained from our study. Experiments show that assisted by semantic analysis engines, our tool significantly improves the success rates of repair to 65.9%~85.5%.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods lack both meaningful verification signals from realistic environments and explicit optimization for verification, leading to unreliable self-verification. To address these limitations, we propose ReVeal, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that interleaves code generation with explicit self-verification and tool-based evaluation. ReVeal enables LLMs to autonomously generate test cases, invoke external tools for precise feedback, and improves performance via a customized RL algorithm with dense, per-turn rewards. As a result, ReVeal fosters the co-evolution of a model's generation and verification capabilities through RL training, expanding the reasoning boundaries of the base model, demonstrated by significant gains in Pass@k on LiveCodeBench. It also enables test-time scaling into deeper inference regimes, with code consistently evolving as the number of turns increases during inference, ultimately surpassing DeepSeek-R1-Zero-Qwen-32B. These findings highlight the promise of ReVeal as a scalable and effective paradigm for building more robust and autonomous AI agents.</p></details> |  |

Using proprietary intellectual property (IP) for FT presents a serious risk, as FT data can be leaked through LLM inference. This leads to a critical dilemma for design houses: seeking to build externally accessible LLMs offering competitive Verilog coding, how can they leverage in-house IP to enhance FT utility while ensuring IP protection? For the first time in the literature, we study this dilemma. Using LLaMA 3.1-8B, we conduct in-house FT on a baseline Verilog dataset (RTLCoder) supplemented with our own in-house IP, which is validated through multiple tape-outs. To rigorously assess IP leakage, we quantify structural similarity (AST/Dolos) and functional equivalence (Synopsys Formality) between generated codes and our in-house IP. We show that our IP can indeed be leaked, confirming the threat. As defense, we evaluate logic locking of Verilog codes (ASSURE). This offers some level of protection, yet reduces the IP's utility for FT and degrades the LLM's performance. Our study shows the need for novel strategies that are both effective and minimally disruptive to FT, an essential effort for enabling design houses to fully utilize their proprietary IP toward LLM-driven Verilog coding.</p></details> |  |
| **[The complete weight distribution of a family of irreducible cyclic codes of dimension two](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11349v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An important family of codes for data storage systems, cryptography, consumer electronics, and network coding for error control in digital communications are the so-called cyclic codes. This kind of linear codes are also important due to their efficient encoding and decoding algorithms. Because of this, cyclic codes have been studied for many years, however their complete weight distributions are known only for a few cases. The complete weight distribution has a wide range of applications in many research fields as the information it contains is of vital use in practical applications. Unfortunately, obtaining these distributions is in general a very hard problem that normally involves the evaluation of sophisticated exponential sums, which leaves this problem open for most of the cyclic codes. In this paper we determine, for any finite field $\bbbf_q$, the explicit factorization of any polynomial of the form $x^{q+1}-c$, where $c \in \bbbf_{q}^*$. Then we use this result to obtain, without the need to evaluate any kind of exponential sum, the complete weight distributions of a family of irreducible cyclic codes of dimension two over any finite field. As an application of our findings, we employ the complete weight distributions of some irreducible cyclic codes presented here to construct systematic authentication codes, showing that they are optimal or almost optimal.</p></details> |  |

A Novel Hierarchical Feature Fusion Method for CoSAm: A Code-Switched Autism Corpus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.14328v3)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a complex neuro-developmental challenge, presenting a spectrum of difficulties in social interaction, communication, and the expression of repetitive behaviors in different situations. This increasing prevalence underscores the importance of ASD as a major public health concern and the need for comprehensive research initiatives to advance our understanding of the disorder and its early detection methods. This study introduces a novel hierarchical feature fusion method aimed at enhancing the early detection of ASD in children through the analysis of code-switched speech (English and Hindi). Employing advanced audio processing techniques, the research integrates acoustic, paralinguistic, and linguistic information using Transformer Encoders. This innovative fusion strategy is designed to improve classification robustness and accuracy, crucial for early and precise ASD identification. The methodology involves collecting a code-switched speech corpus, CoSAm, from children diagnosed with ASD and a matched control group. The dataset comprises 61 voice recordings from 30 children diagnosed with ASD and 31 from neurotypical children, aged between 3 and 13 years, resulting in a total of 159.75 minutes of voice recordings. The feature analysis focuses on MFCCs and extensive statistical attributes to capture speech pattern variability and complexity. The best model performance is achieved using a hierarchical fusion technique with an accuracy of 98.75% using a combination of acoustic and linguistic features first, followed by paralinguistic features in a hierarchical manner.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ar...</summary><p>We are withdrawing this paper as the current version requires substantial changes to the experimental design and analysis in Sections 4 and 5.

There are three approaches: 1) conventional methods use surface form similarity metrics (token match, exact match, etc.) which have numerous limitations, 2) execution-based evaluation focuses more on code functionality based on pass/fail judgments for given test-cases, and 3) LLM-as-a-Judge employs LLMs for automated evaluation to judge if it is a correct answer for a given problem based on pre-defined metrics. In this work, we focused on enhancing LLM-as-a-Judge using bidirectional functionality matching and logic representation for reference-less automatic validation and refinement for Bash code generation to select the best model for automatic incident remediation in IT Automation. We used execution-based evaluation as ground-truth to evaluate our LLM-as-a-Judge metrics. Results show high accuracy and agreement with execution-based evaluation (and up to 8% over baseline). Finally, we built Reflection code agents to utilize judgments and feedback from our evaluation metrics which achieved significant improvement (up to 24% increase in accuracy) for automatic code refinement.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Execution Guided Line-by-Line Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10948v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a novel approach to neural code generation that incorporates real-time execution signals into the language model generation process. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation capabilities, they typically do not utilize execution feedback during inference, a critical signal that human programmers regularly leverage. Our method, Execution-Guided Classifier-Free Guidance (EG-CFG), dynamically incorporates execution signals as the model generates code, providing line-by-line feedback that guides the generation process toward executable solutions. EG-CFG employs a multi-stage process: first, we conduct beam search to sample candidate program completions for each line; second, we extract execution signals by executing these candidates against test cases; and finally, we incorporate these signals into the prompt during generation. By maintaining consistent signals across tokens within the same line and refreshing signals at line boundaries, our approach provides coherent guidance while preserving syntactic structure. Moreover, the method naturally supports native parallelism at the task level in which multiple agents operate in parallel, exploring diverse reasoning paths and collectively generating a broad set of candidate solutions. Our experiments across diverse coding tasks demonstrate that EG-CFG significantly improves code generation performance compared to standard approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results across various levels of complexity, from foundational problems to challenging competitive programming tasks. Our code is available at: https://github.com/boazlavon/eg_cfg</p></details> |  |

We present the first comprehensive benchmark, which we name `Software Engineering Language Understanding' (SELU), for evaluating LLMs on 17 non-code tasks, spanning from identifying whether a requirement is functional or non-functional to estimating the effort and complexity of backlog items. SELU covers classification, regression, Named Entity Recognition (NER), and Masked Language Modeling (MLM) targets, with data drawn from diverse sources such as code repositories, issue tracking systems, and developer forums. We fine-tune 22 open-source LLMs, prompt two proprietary alternatives, and train two baselines. Performance is measured using metrics such as F1-macro, SMAPE, F1-micro, and accuracy, and compared via the Bayesian signed-rank test. Our results show that moderate-scale decoder-only models consistently form a top-tier, exhibiting high mean performance and low across-task variance, while domain adaptation via code-focused pre-training might yield only modest improvements. These insights guide model selection for non-code SE workflows and highlight directions for expanding SELU to generative and design-oriented scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain-of-Code Collapse: Reasoning Failures in LLMs via Adversarial Prompting in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06971v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable success in tasks requiring complex reasoning, such as code generation, mathematical problem solving, and algorithmic synthesis -- especially when aided by reasoning tokens and Chain-of-Thought prompting. Yet, a core question remains: do these models truly reason, or do they merely exploit shallow statistical patterns? In this paper, we introduce Chain-of-Code Collapse, where we systematically investigate the robustness of reasoning LLMs by introducing a suite of semantically faithful yet adversarially structured prompt perturbations. Our evaluation -- spanning 700 perturbed code generations derived from LeetCode-style problems -- applies transformations such as storytelling reframing, irrelevant constraint injection, example reordering, and numeric perturbation. We observe that while certain modifications severely degrade performance (with accuracy drops up to -42.1%), others surprisingly improve model accuracy by up to 35.3%, suggesting sensitivity not only to semantics but also to surface-level prompt dynamics. These findings expose the fragility and unpredictability of current reasoning systems, underscoring the need for more principles approaches to reasoning alignments and prompting robustness. We release our perturbation datasets and evaluation framework to promote further research in trustworthy and resilient LLM reasoning.</p></details> |  |

However, concerns about data contamination - where benchmark data inadvertently leaks into pre-training or fine-tuning datasets - raise questions about the validity of these evaluations. While this issue is known, limiting the industrial adoption of LLM-driven software engineering, hardware coding has received little to no attention regarding these risks. For the first time, we analyze state-of-the-art (SOTA) evaluation frameworks for Verilog code generation (VerilogEval and RTLLM), using established methods for contamination detection (CCD and Min-K% Prob). We cover SOTA commercial and open-source LLMs (CodeGen2.5, Minitron 4b, Mistral 7b, phi-4 mini, LLaMA-{1,2,3.1}, GPT-{2,3.5,4o}, Deepseek-Coder, and CodeQwen 1.5), in baseline and fine-tuned models (RTLCoder and Verigen). Our study confirms that data contamination is a critical concern. We explore mitigations and the resulting trade-offs for code quality vs fairness (i.e., reducing contamination toward unbiased benchmarking).</p></details> |  |
| **[CoRT: Code-integrated Reasoning within Thinking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09820v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) like o1 and DeepSeek-R1 have shown remarkable progress in natural language reasoning with long chain-of-thought (CoT), yet they remain inefficient or inaccurate when handling complex mathematical operations. Addressing these limitations through computational tools (e.g., computation libraries and symbolic solvers) is promising, but it introduces a technical challenge: Code Interpreter (CI) brings external knowledge beyond the model's internal text representations, thus the direct combination is not efficient. This paper introduces CoRT, a post-training framework for teaching LRMs to leverage CI effectively and efficiently. As a first step, we address the data scarcity issue by synthesizing code-integrated reasoning data through Hint-Engineering, which strategically inserts different hints at appropriate positions to optimize LRM-CI interaction. We manually create 30 high-quality samples, upon which we post-train models ranging from 1.5B to 32B parameters, with supervised fine-tuning, rejection fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Our experimental results demonstrate that Hint-Engineering models achieve 4\% and 8\% absolute improvements on DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-32B and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Qwen-1.5B respectively, across five challenging mathematical reasoning datasets. Furthermore, Hint-Engineering models use about 30\% fewer tokens for the 32B model and 50\% fewer tokens for the 1.5B model compared with the natural language models. The models and code are available at https://github.com/ChengpengLi1003/CoRT.</p></details> | work in progress |

While changed files are commonly presented in alphabetical order, this does not necessarily coincide with the reviewer's preferred navigation sequence. This study investigates the different navigation orders developers follow while commenting on changes submitted in pull requests. We mined code review comments from 23,241 pull requests in 100 popular Java and Python repositories on GitHub to analyze the order in which the reviewers commented on the submitted changes. Our analysis shows that for 44.6% of pull requests, the reviewers comment in a non-alphabetical order. Among these pull requests, we identified traces of alternative meaningful orders: 20.6% (2,134) followed a largest-diff-first order, 17.6% (1,827) were commented in the order of the files' similarity to the pull request's title and description, and 29% (1,188) of pull requests containing changes to both production and test files adhered to a test-first order. We also observed that the proportion of reviewed files to total submitted files was significantly higher in non-alphabetically ordered reviews, which also received slightly fewer approvals from reviewers, on average. Our findings highlight the need for additional support during code reviews, particularly for larger pull requests, where reviewers are more likely to adopt complex strategies rather than following a single predefined order.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Unsupervised Adaptation of a Speech Recogniser Using Entropy Minimisation and Speaker Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10653v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Speech recognisers usually perform optimally only in a specific environment and need to be adapted to work well in another. For adaptation to a new speaker, there is often too little data for fine-tuning to be robust, and that data is usually unlabelled. This paper proposes a combination of approaches to make adaptation to a single minute of data robust. First, instead of estimating the adaptation parameters with cross-entropy on a single error-prone hypothesis or "pseudo-label", this paper proposes a novel loss function, the conditional entropy over complete hypotheses. Using multiple hypotheses makes adaptation more robust to errors in the initial recognition. Second, a "speaker code" characterises a speaker in a vector short enough that it requires little data to estimate. On a far-field noise-augmented version of Common Voice, the proposed scheme yields a 20% relative improvement in word error rate on one minute of adaptation data, increasing on 10 minutes to 29%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning-Based Digitization of Overlapping ECG Images with Open-Source Python Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10617v1)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the persistent challenge of accurately digitizing paper-based electrocardiogram (ECG) recordings, with a particular focus on robustly handling single leads compromised by signal overlaps-a common yet under-addressed issue in existing methodologies. We propose a two-stage pipeline designed to overcome this limitation. The first stage employs a U-Net based segmentation network, trained on a dataset enriched with overlapping signals and fortified with custom data augmentations, to accurately isolate the primary ECG trace. The subsequent stage converts this refined binary mask into a time-series signal using established digitization techniques, enhanced by an adaptive grid detection module for improved versatility across different ECG formats and scales. Our experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. The U-Net architecture achieves an IoU of 0.87 for the fine-grained segmentation task. Crucially, our proposed digitization method yields superior performance compared to a well-established baseline technique across both non-overlapping and challenging overlapping ECG samples. For non-overlapping signals, our method achieved a Mean Squared Error (MSE) of 0.0010 and a Pearson Correlation Coefficient (rho) of 0.9644, compared to 0.0015 and 0.9366, respectively, for the baseline. On samples with signal overlap, our method achieved an MSE of 0.0029 and a rho of 0.9641, significantly improving upon the baseline's 0.0178 and 0.8676. This work demonstrates an effective strategy to significantly enhance digitization accuracy, especially in the presence of signal overlaps, thereby laying a strong foundation for the reliable conversion of analog ECG records into analyzable digital data for contemporary research and clinical applications. The implementation is publicly available at this GitHub repository: https://github.com/masoudrahimi39/ECG-code.</p></details> |  |

From a coding viewpoint, the DL channel state acquired at the users via DL training can be seen as an information source that must be conveyed to the base station via the UL communication channels. The transmission of a source through a channel can be accomplished either by separate or joint source-channel coding (SSCC or JSCC). In this work, using classical remote distortion-rate (DR) theory, we first provide a theoretical lower bound on the channel estimation mean-square-error (MSE) of both JSCC and SSCC-based feedback schemes, which however requires encoding of large blocks of successive channel states and thus cannot be used in practicesince it would incur in an extremely large feedback delay. We then focus on the relevant case of minimal (one slot) feedback delay and propose a practical JSCC-based feedback scheme that fully exploits the channel second-order statistics to optimize the dimension projection in the eigenspace. We analyze the large SNR behavior of the proposed JSCC-based scheme in terms of the quality scaling exponent (QSE). Given the second-order statistics of channel estimation of any feedback scheme, we further derive the closed-form of the lower bound to the ergodic sum-rate for DL data transmission under maximum ratio transmission and zero-forcing precoding. Via extensive numerical results, we show that our proposed JSCC-based scheme outperforms known JSCC, SSCC baseline and deep learning-based schemes and is able to approach the performance of the optimal DR scheme in the range of practical SNR.</p></details> |  |

Dynamically selecting the optimal LLM based on task difficulty and resource constraints offers a promising approach to achieve an optimal balance between efficiency and performance. However, existing model selection methods are resource-intensive and often neglect cost efficiency. Moreover, these approaches rely on human-annotated difficulty labels that are frequently inaccessible in real-world settings and may not align with the LLM's own assessment of task difficulty. In this paper, we introduce AdaptiveLLM, a framework that dynamically selects optimal LLMs for a given coding task by automatically assessing task difficulty. Our framework first estimates task difficulty using Chain-of-Thought lengths generated by reasoning model, clusters these into three difficulty levels via k-means, and fine-tunes CodeBERT to embed difficulty-aware features. A trained XGBoost classifier then selects the best model for each problem, optimizing the performance-cost trade-off. Experimental results show that AdaptiveLLM achieves a 7.86% improvement in pass@1 score while reducing resource consumption by 88.9% compared to baseline method ComplexityNet. When compared to a single model, AdaptiveLLM demonstrates an approximately 15% accuracy improvement, while maintaining the same level of cost consumption. Apart from that, the difficulty assessment using CoT provides more reliable selection criteria than human evaluation. Our replication package is available at https://github.com/cjhCoder7/AdaptiveLLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by Internetware 2025</p></details> |

This paradigm has achieved significant success in face video compression. However, compared to facial videos, human body videos pose greater challenges due to their more complex and diverse motion patterns, i.e., when using explicit motion guidance for Generative Human Video Coding (GHVC), the reconstruction results could suffer severe distortions and inaccurate motion. As such, this paper highlights the limitations of explicit motion-based approaches for human body video compression and investigates the GHVC performance improvement with the aid of Implicit Motion Transformation, namely IMT. In particular, we propose to characterize complex human body signal into compact visual features and transform these features into implicit motion guidance for signal reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed IMT paradigm, which can facilitate GHVC to achieve high-efficiency compression and high-fidelity synthesis.</p></details> |  |

This study presents AutoGEEval++, an enhanced framework building on AutoGEEval, and the first automated assessment system for large language models (LLMs) generating geospatial code on Google Earth Engine (GEE). It supports diverse data modalities and varying task complexities. Built on the GEE Python API, AutoGEEval++ features a benchmark dataset-AutoGEEval++-Bench-with 6,365 test cases across 26 data types and three task categories: unit, combo, and theme tests. It includes a submission programme and a judge module to realise an end-to-end automated evaluation pipeline from code generation to execution-based validation. The framework adopts multi-dimensional metrics-accuracy, resource usage, run-time efficiency, and error types-balancing hallucination control and efficiency, and enabling boundary testing and error pattern analysis. Using AutoGEEval++, we evaluate 24 state-of-the-art LLMs (as of June 2025), including general-purpose, reasoning-enhanced, code-centric, and geoscience-specific models. Results reveal clear performance, stability, and error differences across task types, model designs, and deployment settings, confirming AutoGEEval++'s practical value and scalability in vertical-domain code generation. This work establishes the first standardised evaluation protocol and foundational benchmark for GEE-based LLM code generation, providing a unified basis for performance comparison and a methodological framework for systematic, domain-specific code evaluation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoding for Punctured Convolutional and Turbo Codes: A Deep Learning Solution for Protocols Compliance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15475v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network-based decoding methods have shown promise in enhancing error correction performance, but traditional approaches struggle with the challenges posed by punctured codes. In particular, these methods fail to address the complexities of variable code rates and the need for protocol compatibility. This paper presents a unified Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)-based decoding architecture specifically designed to overcome these challenges. The proposed method unifies punctured convolutional and Turbo codes. A puncture embedding mechanism integrates puncturing patterns directly into the network, enabling seamless adaptation to varying code rates, while balanced bit error rate training ensures robustness across different code lengths, rates, and channels, maintaining protocol flexibility. Extensive simulations in Additive White Gaussian Noise and Rayleigh fading channels demonstrate that the proposed approach outperforms conventional decoding techniques, providing significant improvements in decoding accuracy and robustness. These results underscore the potential of LSTM-based decoding as a promising solution for next-generation artificial intelligence powered communication systems.</p></details> |  |

However, obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable, step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and overthinking.</p></details> |  |

A static code analysis framework detects issues such as bugs, vulnerabilities, and code smells within a large-scale software project. Detailed information on each issue was extracted and organized to facilitate automated code revision using LLMs. An iterative prompt engineering process is applied to ensure that prompts are structured to produce accurate and organized outputs aligned with the project requirements. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is implemented to enhance the relevance and precision of the revisions, enabling LLM to access and integrate real-time external knowledge. The issue of LLM hallucinations - where the model generates plausible but incorrect outputs - is addressed by a custom-built "Code Comparison App," which identifies and corrects erroneous changes before applying them to the codebase. Subsequent scans using the static code analysis framework revealed a significant reduction in code issues, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining LLMs, static analysis, and RAG to improve code quality, streamline the software development process, and reduce time and resource expenditure.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FORGE 2025</p></details> |

The success of these optimizations primarily depends on the selection and ordering of the optimization passes applied to the code. While most compilers rely on a fixed sequence of optimization passes, current methods to find the optimal sequence either employ impractically slow search algorithms or learning methods that struggle to generalize to code unseen during training. We introduce CompilerDream, a model-based reinforcement learning approach to general code optimization. CompilerDream comprises a compiler world model that accurately simulates the intrinsic properties of optimization passes and an agent trained on this model to produce effective optimization strategies. By training on a large-scale program dataset, CompilerDream is equipped to serve as a general code optimizer across various application scenarios and source-code languages. Our extensive experiments first highlight CompilerDream's strong optimization capabilities for autotuning, where it leads the CompilerGym leaderboard. More importantly, the zero-shot generalization ability of large-scale trained compiler world model and agent, excels across diverse datasets, surpassing LLVM's built-in optimizations and other state-of-the-art methods in both settings of value prediction and end-to-end code optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>KDD 2...</summary><p>KDD 2025 camera-ready version with extended appendix.

| **[Prompt Variability Effects On LLM Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10204v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation is one of the most active areas of application of Large Language Models (LLMs). While LLMs lower barriers to writing code and accelerate development process, the overall quality of generated programs depends on the quality of given prompts. Specifically, functionality and quality of generated code can be sensitive to user's background and familiarity with software development. It is therefore important to quantify LLM's sensitivity to variations in the input. To this end we propose a synthetic evaluation pipeline for code generation with LLMs, as well as a systematic persona-based evaluation approach to expose qualitative differences of LLM responses dependent on prospective user background. Both proposed methods are completely independent from specific programming tasks and LLMs, and thus are widely applicable. We provide experimental evidence illustrating utility of our methods and share our code for the benefit of the community.</p></details> |  |
| **[Privacy-aware Berrut Approximated Coded Computing for Federated Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.01704v3)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Federated Learning (FL) is an interesting strategy that enables the collaborative training of an AI model among different data owners without revealing their private datasets. Even so, FL has some privacy vulnerabilities that have been tried to be overcome by applying some techniques like Differential Privacy (DP), Homomorphic Encryption (HE), or Secure Multi-Party Computation (SMPC). However, these techniques have some important drawbacks that might narrow their range of application: problems to work with non-linear functions and to operate large matrix multiplications and high communication and computational costs to manage semi-honest nodes. In this context, we propose a solution to guarantee privacy in FL schemes that simultaneously solves the previously mentioned problems. Our proposal is based on the Berrut Approximated Coded Computing, a technique from the Coded Distributed Computing paradigm, adapted to a Secret Sharing configuration, to provide input privacy to FL in a scalable way. It can be applied for computing non-linear functions and treats the special case of distributed matrix multiplication, a key primitive at the core of many automated learning tasks. Because of these characteristics, it could be applied in a wide range of FL scenarios, since it is independent of the machine learning models or aggregation algorithms used in the FL scheme. We provide analysis of the achieved privacy and complexity of our solution and, due to the extensive numerical results performed, a good trade-off between privacy and precision can be observed.</p></details> |  |

Unlike other assets, however, HC is not currently subject to well-defined measurement or disclosure rules. We use a machine learning algorithm (word2vec) trained on a confirmed set of HC disclosures to develop a comprehensive list of HC-related keywords classified into five subcategories (DEI; health and safety; labor relations and culture; compensation and benefits; and demographics and other) that capture the multidimensional nature of HC management. We share our lexicon, corporate HC disclosures, and the Python code used to develop the lexicon, and we provide detailed examples of using our data and code, including for fine-tuning a BERT model. Researchers can use our HC lexicon (or modify the code to capture another construct of interest) with their samples of corporate communications to address pertinent HC questions. We close with a discussion of future research opportunities related to HC management and disclosure.</p></details> | <details><summary>50 pa...</summary><p>50 pages, 6 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Yet, despite recent advances, their output often suffers from syntactic and semantic errors and remains difficult to read. Recently, with the advent of large language models (LLMs), researchers began to explore the potential of LLMs to refine decompiler output. Nevertheless, our study of these approaches reveals significant limitations, such as introducing new errors and relying on unreliable accuracy validation. In this paper, we present D-LiFT, an automated decompiler backend that harnesses and further trains LLMs to improve the quality of decompiled code via reinforcement learning (RL). Unlike prior work that overlooks preserving accuracy, D-LiFT adheres to a key principle for enhancing the quality of decompiled code: \textit{preserving accuracy while improving readability}. Central to D-LiFT, we propose D-SCORE, an integrated quality assessment system to score the decompiled code from multiple aspects. In line with our principle, D-SCORE assigns low scores to any inaccurate output and only awards higher scores for readability to code that passes the accuracy check. Specifically, D-SCORE first verifies the syntactic and semantic correctness via the compiler and symbolic execution; only if a candidate is deemed accurate, it then evaluates readability using established metrics to compare the LLM output with the original decompiled code. The score will then be fed back to the LLM for fine-tuning. Our implementation, based on Ghidra and a range of LLMs, demonstrates significant improvements for the accurate decompiled code from the coreutils and util-linux projects. Compared to baseline LLMs without D-SCORE-driven fine-tuning, D-LiFT produces 55.3% more improved decompiled functions, as measured by D-SCORE.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiKO: A Hierarchical Framework for Beyond-Second-Order KO Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10121v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces HiKO (Hierarchical Kronecker Operation), a novel framework for training high-rate neural error-correcting codes that enables KO codes to outperform Reed-Muller codes beyond second order. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to extend KO codes beyond second order. While conventional KO codes show promising results for low-rate regimes ($r < 2$), they degrade at higher rates -- a critical limitation for practical deployment. Our framework incorporates three key innovations: (1) a hierarchical training methodology that decomposes complex high-rate codes into simpler constituent codes for efficient knowledge transfer, (2) enhanced neural architectures with dropout regularization and learnable skip connections tailored for the Plotkin structure, and (3) a progressive unfreezing strategy that systematically transitions from pre-trained components to fully optimized integrated codes. Our experiments show that HiKO codes consistently outperform traditional Reed-Muller codes across various configurations, achieving notable performance improvements for third-order ($r = 3$) and fourth-order ($r = 4$) codes. Analysis reveals that HiKO codes successfully approximate Shannon-optimal Gaussian codebooks while preserving efficient decoding properties. This represents the first successful extension of KO codes beyond second order, opening new possibilities for neural code deployment in high-throughput communication systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[ChartReasoner: Code-Driven Modality Bridging for Long-Chain Reasoning in Chart Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10116v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, large language models have shown remarkable reasoning capabilities through long-chain reasoning before responding. However, how to extend this capability to visual reasoning tasks remains an open challenge. Existing multimodal reasoning approaches transfer such visual reasoning task into textual reasoning task via several image-to-text conversions, which often lose critical structural and semantic information embedded in visualizations, especially for tasks like chart question answering that require a large amount of visual details. To bridge this gap, we propose ChartReasoner, a code-driven novel two-stage framework designed to enable precise, interpretable reasoning over charts. We first train a high-fidelity model to convert diverse chart images into structured ECharts codes, preserving both layout and data semantics as lossless as possible. Then, we design a general chart reasoning data synthesis pipeline, which leverages this pretrained transport model to automatically and scalably generate chart reasoning trajectories and utilizes a code validator to filter out low-quality samples. Finally, we train the final multimodal model using a combination of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning on our synthesized chart reasoning dataset and experimental results on four public benchmarks clearly demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed ChartReasoner. It can preserve the original details of the charts as much as possible and perform comparably with state-of-the-art open-source models while using fewer parameters, approaching the performance of proprietary systems like GPT-4o in out-of-domain settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reward Models Enable Scalable Code Verification by Trading Accuracy for Throughput](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10056v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The standard paradigm for solving coding tasks via large language models (LLMs) is to generate-then-rank programs, where the latter step uses a verifier in the ranking process. The growing consensus is that a comprehensive verifier (e.g., a full test suite) should be prioritized over an outcome reward model (ORM) whenever possible, with little consideration given to the trade-offs involved. We aim to challenge this assumption by systematically exploring the tradeoff between speed and accuracy. We find that ORMs play a crucial role in scaling verification through trading accuracy for speed, even when a comprehensive verifier is available. Their value becomes especially apparent when used in a generate-prune-then-rank approach, where a faster but less accurate verifier removes incorrect solutions prior to ranking -- leading to a system that is 11.65x faster while only being 8.33% less accurate than the full test suite. We analyze the generate-prune-then-rank approach and show that it works by filtering out incorrect but highly ranked solutions. These findings enable the design of scalable and accurate program ranking systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, 6 figures, code released here: https://github.com/SprocketLab/orm-code-verifier</p></details> |

The spiking neural networks (SNNs) with low-power consumption characteristics can provide a novel solution for this research. Therefore, we apply SNNs to monocular 3D object detection and propose the SpikeSMOKE architecture in this paper, which is a new attempt for low-power monocular 3D object detection. As we all know, discrete signals of SNNs will generate information loss and limit their feature expression ability compared with the artificial neural networks (ANNs).In order to address this issue, inspired by the filtering mechanism of biological neuronal synapses, we propose a cross-scale gated coding mechanism(CSGC), which can enhance feature representation by combining cross-scale fusion of attentional methods and gated filtering mechanisms.In addition, to reduce the computation and increase the speed of training, we present a novel light-weight residual block that can maintain spiking computing paradigm and the highest possible detection performance. Compared to the baseline SpikeSMOKE under the 3D Object Detection, the proposed SpikeSMOKE with CSGC can achieve 11.78 (+2.82, Easy), 10.69 (+3.2, Moderate), and 10.48 (+3.17, Hard) on the KITTI autonomous driving dataset by AP|R11 at 0.7 IoU threshold, respectively. It is important to note that the results of SpikeSMOKE can significantly reduce energy consumption compared to the results on SMOKE. For example,the energy consumption can be reduced by 72.2% on the hard category, while the detection performance is reduced by only 4%. SpikeSMOKE-L (lightweight) can further reduce the amount of parameters by 3 times and computation by 10 times compared to SMOKE.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the inherent complexity of parallel programming creates a demand for the automated sequential-to-parallel approaches. However, data scarcity poses a significant challenge for machine learning-based sequential-to-parallel code translation. Although recent back-translation methods show promise, they still fail to ensure functional equivalence in the translated code. In this paper, we propose a novel Mutual-Supervised Learning (MSL) framework for sequential-to-parallel code translation to address the functional equivalence issue. MSL consists of two models, a Translator and a Tester. Through an iterative loop consisting of Co-verify and Co-evolve steps, the Translator and the Tester mutually generate data for each other and improve collectively. The Tester generates unit tests to verify and filter functionally equivalent translated code, thereby evolving the Translator, while the Translator generates translated code as augmented input to evolve the Tester. Experimental results demonstrate that MuSL significantly enhances the performance of the base model: when applied to Qwen2.5-Coder, it not only improves Pass@1 by up to 28.91% and boosts Tester performance by 68.90%, but also outperforms the previous state-of-the-art method CodeRosetta by 1.56 and 6.92 in BLEU and CodeBLEU scores, while achieving performance comparable to DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1.

Furthermore, basing on the properties of finite fields, we construct a class of optimal ternary cyclic codes with respect to the Sphere Packing Bound, and show that these codes are not equivalent to any known codes.</p></details> | 17 pages |

Inspired by the human process of second language acquisition, particularly code-switching$\unicode{x2014}$the practice of language alternation in a conversation$\unicode{x2014}$we propose code-switching curriculum learning (CSCL) to enhance cross-lingual transfer for LLMs. CSCL mimics the stages of human language learning by progressively training models with a curriculum consisting of 1) token-level code-switching, 2) sentence-level code-switching, and 3) monolingual corpora. Using Qwen 2 as our underlying model, we demonstrate the efficacy of the CSCL in improving language transfer to Korean, achieving significant performance gains compared to monolingual continual pre-training methods. Ablation studies reveal that both token- and sentence-level code-switching significantly enhance cross-lingual transfer and that curriculum learning amplifies these effects. We also extend our findings into various languages, including Japanese (high-resource) and Indonesian (low-resource), and using two additional models (Gemma 2 and Phi 3.5). We further show that CSCL mitigates spurious correlations between language resources and safety alignment, presenting a robust, efficient framework for more equitable language transfer in LLMs. We observe that CSCL is effective for low-resource settings where high-quality, monolingual corpora for language transfer are hardly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Findings of ACL 2025</p></details> |

This is due to the promise of revolutionary speedups, where achieving such speedup requires designing an algorithm that harnesses the structure of a problem using quantum mechanics. Yet many quantum programming languages today require programmers to reason at a low level of physics notation and quantum gate circuitry. This presents a significant barrier to entry for programmers who have not yet built up an intuition about quantum gate semantics, and it can prove to be tedious even for those who have. In this paper, we present Qwerty, a new quantum programming language that allows programmers to manipulate qubits more expressively than gates and trace programs without bra-ket notation. Due to its novel basis type and easy interoperability with Python, Qwerty is a powerful framework for high-level quantum-classical computation.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 38 figures; revised syntax and examples, added program-tracing figures</p></details> |

Not surprisingly, with the advent of quantum information processing, a major research path has emerged, aiming to minimize the requirements necessary to achieve OT by leveraging quantum resources, while also exploring the implications for secure computation. Indeed, OT has been the target of renewed focus regarding its newfound quantum possibilities (and impossibilities), both towards its computation and communication complexity. For instance, non-interactive OT, known to be impossible classically, has been strongly pursued. In its most extreme form, non-interactive chosen-input OT (one-shot OT) is equivalent to a One-Time Memory (OTM). OTMs have been proposed as tamper-proof hardware solutions for constructing One-Time Programs -- single-use programs that execute on an arbitrary input without revealing anything about their internal workings. In this work, we leverage quantum resources in the Noisy-Quantum-Storage Model to achieve: 1. Unconditionally-secure two-message non-interactive OT -- the smallest number of messages known to date for unconditionally-secure chosen-input OT. 2. Computationally-secure one-shot OT/OTM, with everlasting security, assuming only one-way functions and sequential functions -- without requiring trusted hardware, QROM, or pre-shared entanglement. 3. One-Time Programs without the need for hardware-based solutions or QROM, by compiling our OTM construction with the [GKR08, GIS+10] compiler.</p></details> | <details><summary>Title...</summary><p>Title and paper changed to include OTM/OTP results.

| **[GenerationPrograms: Fine-grained Attribution with Executable Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14580v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models (LLMs) achieve impressive performance in source-conditioned text generation but often fail to correctly provide fine-grained attributions for their outputs, undermining verifiability and trust. Moreover, existing attribution methods do not explain how and why models leverage the provided source documents to generate their final responses, limiting interpretability. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a modular generation framework, GenerationPrograms, inspired by recent advancements in executable "code agent" architectures. Unlike conventional generation methods that simultaneously generate outputs and attributions or rely on post-hoc attribution, GenerationPrograms decomposes the process into two distinct stages: first, creating an executable program plan composed of modular text operations (such as paraphrasing, compression, and fusion) explicitly tailored to the query, and second, executing these operations following the program's specified instructions to produce the final response. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that GenerationPrograms significantly improves attribution quality at both the document level and sentence level across two long-form question-answering tasks and a multi-document summarization task. We further demonstrate that GenerationPrograms can effectively function as a post-hoc attribution method, outperforming traditional techniques in recovering accurate attributions. In addition, the interpretable programs generated by GenerationPrograms enable localized refinement through modular-level improvements that further enhance overall attribution quality.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 Pa...</summary><p>27 Pages.

| **[Learning Traffic Signal Control via Genetic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17328v3)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The control of traffic signals is crucial for improving transportation efficiency. Recently, learning-based methods, especially Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), garnered substantial success in the quest for more efficient traffic signal control strategies. However, the design of rewards in DRL highly demands domain knowledge to converge to an effective policy, and the final policy also presents difficulties in terms of explainability. In this work, a new learning-based method for signal control in complex intersections is proposed. In our approach, we design a concept of phase urgency for each signal phase. During signal transitions, the traffic light control strategy selects the next phase to be activated based on the phase urgency. We then proposed to represent the urgency function as an explainable tree structure. The urgency function can calculate the phase urgency for a specific phase based on the current road conditions. Genetic programming is adopted to perform gradient-free optimization of the urgency function. We test our algorithm on multiple public traffic signal control datasets. The experimental results indicate that the tree-shaped urgency function evolved by genetic programming outperforms the baselines, including a state-of-the-art method in the transportation field and a well-known DRL-based method. Our code is available online.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Teacher's Dilemma: Balancing Trade-Offs in Programming Education for Emergent Bilingual Students](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.14147v1)** | 2025-06-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>K-12 computing teachers must navigate complex trade-offs when selecting programming languages and instructional materials for classrooms with emergent bilingual students. While they aim to foster an inclusive learning environment by addressing language barriers that impact student engagement, they must also align with K-12 computer science curricular guidelines and prepare students for industry-standard programming tools. Because programming languages predominantly use English keywords and most instructional materials are written in English, these linguistic barriers introduce cognitive load and accessibility challenges. This paper examines teachers' decisions in balancing these competing priorities, highlighting the tensions between accessibility, curriculum alignment, and workforce preparation. The findings shed light on how our teacher participants negotiate these trade-offs and what factors influence their selection of programming tools to best support EB students while meeting broader educational and professional goals.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeImprove: Program Adaptation for Deep Code Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.15804v2)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leveraging deep learning (DL)-based code analysis tools to solve software engineering tasks is becoming increasingly popular. Code models often suffer performance degradation due to various reasons (e.g., code data shifts). Retraining is often required to address these issues, but frequent model updates are costly in labeling and deployment. In this paper, we explore an alternative solution: Adapting the program inputs to the code models. This can be achieved by two steps: 1) input validation that focuses on identifying whether an input is an out-of-scope input program that are beyond a model's handling capability, and 2) input adaptation that adapts out-of-scope inputs to become in-scope inputs. Validating program input is challenging, as current techniques focus on continuous inputs such as image data and fail with discrete inputs like code data, which have unique characteristics and are processed differently by deep learning models. Adapting out-of-scope programs is also challenging due to their vast search spaces. Therefore, in this paper, we propose CodeImprove, which distinguishes out-of-scope from normal inputs and converts such out-of-scope inputs back to in-scope inputs through program transformation. In particular, we propose a validity score metric to identify out-of-scope inputs and leverage genetic algorithms to apply semantic preserving program transformation to convert out-of-scope inputs to in-scope inputs. Our experimental results show CodeImprove can enhance up to 8.78% of accuracy, and 51.28% of relative improvements in three code models on two SE tasks. Additionally, our input validation is promising in detecting out-of-scope inputs (AUC score of 0.924).</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 47th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2025)</p></details> |

In order to prove it, upper bounds are established for the relevant largest eigenvalue sums in terms of the optimal values of certain linear programs. The objective function of these linear programs is the dual of the direct sum of the spectra of the summands. The feasible sets are bounded polyhedra determined by positive numbers, called alignment terms, that quantify the overlaps between pairs of largest eigenvalue spaces of the summands. By appealing to geometric considerations, tight upper bounds are established on the alignment terms of tensor products of positive semi-definite operators. As an application, the spin alignment conjecture in quantum information theory is affirmatively resolved to the 2-letter level. Consequently, the coherent information of platypus channels is additive to the 2-letter level.</p></details> | <details><summary>versi...</summary><p>version 2, 36 pages, 2 figures, error in version 1 corrected; version 3, published version</p></details> |
| **[Programming and Reasoning in Partially Observable Probabilistic Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13491v1)** | 2025-06-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic partial observability is a phenomenon occuring when computer systems are deployed in environments that behave probabilistically and whose exact state cannot be fully observed. In this work, we lay the theoretical groundwork for a probabilistic belief programming language pBLIMP, which maintains a probability distribution over the possible environment states, called a belief state. pBLIMP has language features to symbolically model the behavior of and interaction with the partially observable environment and to condition the belief state based on explicit observations. In particular, pBLIMP programs can perform state estimation and base their decisions (i.e. the control flow) on the likelihood that certain conditions hold in the current state. Furthermore, pBLIMP features unbounded loops, which sets it apart from many other probabilistic programming languages. For reasoning about pBLIMP programs and the situations they model, we present a weakest-precondition-style calculus (wp) that is capable of reasoning about unbounded loops. Soundness of our wp calculus is proven with respect to an operational semantics. We further demonstrate how our wp calculus reasons about (unbounded) loops with loop invariants.</p></details> | <details><summary>54 pa...</summary><p>54 pages, 6 figures, to be published in QEST + FORMATS 2025</p></details> |

Chemical reaction networks are mathematically well represented as hypergraphs, modeling that facilitates the search for pathways by computational means. We propose to enrich an existing search method for pathways by including thermodynamic principles. In more detail, we give a mixed-integer linear programming (mixed ILP) formulation of the search problem into which we integrate chemical potentials and concentrations for individual molecules, enabling us to constrain the search to return pathways containing only thermodynamically favorable reactions. Moreover, if multiple possible pathways are found, we can rank these by objective functions based on thermodynamics. As an example of use, we apply the framework to a reaction network representing the HCN-formamide chemistry. Alternative pathways to the one currently hypothesized in the literature are queried and enumerated, including some that score better according to our chosen objective function.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

Large language models (LLMs) offer new opportunities for APR, but existing studies mostly rely on smaller, earlier-generation models and Java benchmarks. The repair capabilities of modern, large-scale LLMs across diverse languages and scenarios remain underexplored. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study of four open-source LLMs, CodeLlama, LLaMA, StarCoder, and DeepSeek-Coder, spanning 7B to 33B parameters, diverse architectures, and purposes. We evaluate them across two bug scenarios (enterprise-grades and algorithmic), three languages (Java, C/C++, Python), and four prompting strategies, analyzing over 600K generated patches on six benchmarks. Key findings include: (1) model specialization (e.g., CodeLlama) can outperform larger general-purpose models (e.g., LLaMA); (2) repair performance does not scale linearly with model size; (3) correct patches often appear early in generation; and (4) prompts significantly affect results. These insights offer practical guidance for designing effective and efficient LLM-based APR systems.</p></details> |  |

This set of 600 tasks has resisted automated solutions. This paper presents a structured inductive programming approach with LLMs that successfully solves tasks across all IPARC categories. The controlled nature of IPARC reveals insights into LLM-based code generation, including the importance of prior structuring, LLMs' ability to aid structuring (requiring human refinement), the need to freeze correct code, the efficiency of code reuse, and how LLM-generated code can spark human creativity. These findings suggest valuable mechanisms for human-LLM collaboration in tackling complex program synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Engineering Scientific Assistants using Interactive Structured Induction of Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14488v2)** | 2025-06-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We are interested in the construction of software that can act as scientific assistants to domain specialists. It is expected that such assistants will be needed to accelerate the identification of ways to address complex problems requiring urgent solutions. In this paper, our focus is not on a specific scientific problem, but on the software-engineering of such 'science accelerators'. Recent developments in 'No Code' techniques would seem to suggest that scientist can simply hypothesise solutions simply by conversing with a large language model (LLM). However, for complex scientific problems, this seems unlikely given the current state of LLM technology. What does appear feasible is that a software engineer can use LLMs to rapidly construct programs for use by a domain-specialist, including the specialist's requirements expressed in natural language. We propose the design of an interactive form of 'structured' inductive programming in which a software-engineer and an LLM collaboratively construct an 'assistant' for a scientific data analysis. The paper describes a simple implementation called iStrucInd that adapts a '2-way Intelligibility' protocol to implement the interaction between the software engineer and the LLM. We test the tool on two different non-trivial scientific data analysis tasks. Specifically, we compare the system constructed by iStrucInd against systems constructed manually and by Low Code/No Code methods along dimensions of: (a) program performance; (b) program quality; and (c) programming effort. The results show iStrucInd allows a software engineer to develop better programs faster suggesting interactive structured induction can play a useful role in the rapid construction of scientific assistants.</p></details> |  |

Developers increasingly use them for their work, including generating code to fulfil the data protection requirements (privacy) of the apps they build. We wanted to know if the reality is the same as expectations of AI-based programming assistants when trying to fulfil software privacy requirements, and the challenges developers face when using AI-based programming assistants and how these can be improved. To this end, we conducted a survey with 51 professional developers worldwide. We found that AI-based programming assistants need to be improved in order for developers to better trust them with generating code that ensures privacy. In this paper, we provide some recommendations including model and system-level improvements and some key further research directions to improve AI-based programming assistants for developing secure code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at EASE'25 - short papers and emerging results track</p></details> |

To meet this demand, specialized hardware accelerators are being developed. Optimizing these programs for accelerators is challenging for two reasons: program performance is highly sensitive to variations in sparse inputs, and early-stage accelerators rely on expensive simulators. Therefore, ML-based cost models used for optimizing such programs on general-purpose hardware are often ineffective for early-stage accelerators, as they require large datasets for proper training. To this end, we introduce COGNATE, a novel framework that leverages inexpensive data samples from general-purpose hardware (e.g., CPUs) to train cost models, followed by few-shot fine-tuning on emerging hardware. COGNATE exploits the homogeneity of input features across hardware platforms while effectively mitigating heterogeneity, enabling cost model training with just 5% of the data samples needed by accelerator-specific models to achieve comparable performance. We conduct extensive experiments to demonstrate that COGNATE outperforms existing techniques, achieving average speedups of 1.47x (up to 5.46x) for SpMM and 1.39x (up to 4.22x) for SDDMM.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning</p></details> |

However, implementation of quantum recursion involves intricate interplay between quantum control flow and recursive procedure calls. In this paper, we aim at resolving this fundamental challenge and develop a series of techniques to efficiently implement quantum recursive programs. Our main contributions include: 1. We propose a notion of quantum register machine, the first quantum architecture (including an instruction set) that provides instruction-level support for quantum control flow and recursive procedure calls at the same time. 2. Based on quantum register machine, we describe the first comprehensive implementation process of quantum recursive programs, including the compilation, the partial evaluation of quantum control flow, and the execution on the quantum register machine. 3. As a bonus, our efficient implementation of quantum recursive programs also offers automatic parallelisation of quantum algorithms. For implementing certain quantum algorithmic subroutine, like the widely used quantum multiplexor, we can even obtain exponential parallel speed-up (over the straightforward implementation) from this automatic parallelisation. This demonstrates that quantum recursive programming can be win-win for both modularity of programs and efficiency of their implementation.</p></details> | <details><summary>63 pa...</summary><p>63 pages, 25 figures.

| **[Context-Augmented Code Generation Using Programming Knowledge Graphs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18251v2)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) and Code-LLMs (CLLMs) have significantly improved code generation, but, they frequently face difficulties when dealing with challenging and complex problems. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) addresses this issue by retrieving and integrating external knowledge at the inference time. However, retrieval models often fail to find most relevant context, and generation models, with limited context capacity, can hallucinate when given irrelevant data. We present a novel framework that leverages a Programming Knowledge Graph (PKG) to semantically represent and retrieve code. This approach enables fine-grained code retrieval by focusing on the most relevant segments while reducing irrelevant context through a tree-pruning technique. PKG is coupled with a re-ranking mechanism to reduce even more hallucinations by selectively integrating non-RAG solutions. We propose two retrieval approaches-block-wise and function-wise-based on the PKG, optimizing context granularity. Evaluations on the HumanEval and MBPP benchmarks show our method improves pass@1 accuracy by up to 20%, and outperforms state-of-the-art models by up to 34% on MBPP. Our contributions include PKG-based retrieval, tree pruning to enhance retrieval precision, a re-ranking method for robust solution selection and a Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) enhancer module for automatic code augmentation with relevant comments and docstrings.</p></details> | 20 pages, Conference |
| **[Partial identification via conditional linear programs: estimation and policy learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12215v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many important quantities of interest are only partially identified from observable data: the data can limit them to a set of plausible values, but not uniquely determine them. This paper develops a unified framework for covariate-assisted estimation, inference, and decision making in partial identification problems where the parameter of interest satisfies a series of linear constraints, conditional on covariates. In such settings, bounds on the parameter can be written as expectations of solutions to conditional linear programs that optimize a linear function subject to linear constraints, where both the objective function and the constraints may depend on covariates and need to be estimated from data. Examples include estimands involving the joint distributions of potential outcomes, policy learning with inequality-aware value functions, and instrumental variable settings. We propose two de-biased estimators for bounds defined by conditional linear programs. The first directly solves the conditional linear programs with plugin estimates and uses output from standard LP solvers to de-bias the plugin estimate, avoiding the need for computationally demanding vertex enumeration of all possible solutions for symbolic bounds. The second uses entropic regularization to create smooth approximations to the conditional linear programs, trading a small amount of approximation error for improved estimation and computational efficiency. We establish conditions for asymptotic normality of both estimators, show that both estimators are robust to first-order errors in estimating the conditional constraints and objectives, and construct Wald-type confidence intervals for the partially identified parameters. These results also extend to policy learning problems where the value of a decision policy is only partially identified. We apply our methods to a study on the effects of Medicaid enrollment.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Fast, Reliable, and Secure Programming Language for LLM Agents with Code Actions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.12202v1)** | 2025-06-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern large language models (LLMs) are often deployed as agents, calling external tools adaptively to solve tasks. Rather than directly calling tools, it can be more effective for LLMs to write code to perform the tool calls, enabling them to automatically generate complex control flow such as conditionals and loops. Such code actions are typically provided as Python code, since LLMs are quite proficient at it; however, Python may not be the ideal language due to limited built-in support for performance, security, and reliability. We propose a novel programming language for code actions, called Quasar, which has several benefits: (1) automated parallelization to improve performance, (2) uncertainty quantification to improve reliability and mitigate hallucinations, and (3) security features enabling the user to validate actions. LLMs can write code in a subset of Python, which is automatically transpiled to Quasar. We evaluate our approach on the ViperGPT visual question answering agent, applied to the GQA dataset, demonstrating that LLMs with Quasar actions instead of Python actions retain strong performance, while reducing execution time when possible by 42%, improving security by reducing user approval interactions when possible by 52%, and improving reliability by applying conformal prediction to achieve a desired target coverage level.</p></details> |  |

It also serves as a critical enabler for LLM-aided end-to-end hardware language design. However, existing current LLMs often struggle with Register Transfer Level (RTL) code generation, resulting in testbenches that exhibit functional errors in Hardware Description Languages (HDL) logic. Motivated by the strong performance of LLMs in Python code generation under inference-time sampling strategies, and their promising capabilities as judge agents, we propose PRO-V a fully program generation multi-agent system for robust RTL verification. Pro-V incorporates an efficient best-of-n iterative sampling strategy to enhance the correctness of generated testbenches. Moreover, it introduces an LLM-as-a-judge aid validation framework featuring an automated prompt generation pipeline. By converting rule-based static analysis from the compiler into natural language through in-context learning, this pipeline enables LLMs to assist the compiler in determining whether verification failures stem from errors in the RTL design or the testbench. PRO-V attains a verification accuracy of 87.17% on golden RTL implementations and 76.28% on RTL mutants. Our code is open-sourced at https://github.com/stable-lab/Pro-V.</p></details> |  |

Drawing on knowledge from a group of medalists in international algorithmic contests, we revisit this claim, examining how LLMs differ from human experts and where limitations still remain. We introduce LiveCodeBench Pro, a benchmark composed of problems from Codeforces, ICPC, and IOI that are continuously updated to reduce the likelihood of data contamination. A team of Olympiad medalists annotates every problem for algorithmic categories and conducts a line-by-line analysis of failed model-generated submissions. Using this new data and benchmark, we find that frontier models still have significant limitations: without external tools, the best model achieves only 53% pass@1 on medium-difficulty problems and 0% on hard problems, domains where expert humans still excel. We also find that LLMs succeed at implementation-heavy problems but struggle with nuanced algorithmic reasoning and complex case analysis, often generating confidently incorrect justifications. High performance appears largely driven by implementation precision and tool augmentation, not superior reasoning. LiveCodeBench Pro thus highlights the significant gap to human grandmaster levels, while offering fine-grained diagnostics to steer future improvements in code-centric LLM reasoning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page at https://livecodebenchpro.com/</p></details> |

Here, we extend the IS approach by introducing instruction and solution probabilities as additional heuristics. Instruction probability reflects the expectation of an instruction occurring in a solution, based on the frequency of instruction occurrence in a large code sample. The solution probability for a partial or complete program is simply the product of all constituent instruction probabilities, including duplicates. We treat the minimum solution probabilities observed in code sample program units of different sizes as solution probability thresholds. These thresholds are used to prune the search space as partial solutions are constructed, thereby eliminating any branches containing unlikely combinations of instructions. The new approach has been evaluated using a large sample of human code. We tested two formulations of instruction probability: one based on instruction occurrence across the entire code sample and another that measured the distribution separately for each IS. Our results show that both variants produce substantial further reductions in the IP search space size of up to tens of orders of magnitude, depending on solution size. In combination with IS, reductions of over 100 orders of magnitude can be achieved. We also carried out cross-validation testing to show that the heuristics should work effectively with unseen code. The approach is described and the results and some ideas for future work are discussed.</p></details> | 10 pages, 10 figures |

Inequality constraints are handled using a primal-dual interior point formulation and step acceptance for equality constraints follows a line-search filter approach. The iterates of the algorithm are derived under the Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) framework. A proof of local quadratic convergence of the IPDDP2 iterates is provided. Our numerical experiments evaluate IPDDP2 on over 500 OCPs derived from five different classes of robotic motion planning problems, three of which are contact-implicit trajectory optimisation problems. IPDDP2 demonstrates improvements in robustness against existing constrained DDP algorithms for contact-implicit planning, while being significantly faster than general-purpose solver IPOPT. We provide a full implementation of IPDDP2 in the Julia programming language.</p></details> |  |

Specifically, function-level diffing tools are the most widely used in BCSA: they perform function matching one by one for evaluating the similarity between binary programs. However, such methods need a high time complexity, making them unscalable in large-scale scenarios (e.g., 1/n-to-n search). Towards effective and efficient program-level BCSA, we propose KEENHash, a novel hashing approach that hashes binaries into program-level representations through large language model (LLM)-generated function embeddings. KEENHash condenses a binary into one compact and fixed-length program embedding using K-Means and Feature Hashing, allowing us to do effective and efficient large-scale program-level BCSA, surpassing the previous state-of-the-art methods. The experimental results show that KEENHash is at least 215 times faster than the state-of-the-art function matching tools while maintaining effectiveness. Furthermore, in a large-scale scenario with 5.3 billion similarity evaluations, KEENHash takes only 395.83 seconds while these tools will cost at least 56 days. We also evaluate KEENHash on the program clone search of large-scale BCSA across extensive datasets in 202,305 binaries. Compared with 4 state-of-the-art methods, KEENHash outperforms all of them by at least 23.16%, and displays remarkable superiority over them in the large-scale BCSA security scenario of malware detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Quadratic Programming Approach to Flight Envelope Protection Using Control Barrier Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.18951v2)** | 2025-06-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safe operation of aerospace systems within their prescribed flight envelope is a fundamental requirement for modern flight control systems. Flight envelope protection prevents violations of aerodynamic, structural, and performance constraints, mitigating risks such as stall, excessive loads, and loss of control. Conventional FEP approaches, such as reference clipping via saturation functions and model-based command filtering, impose constraints at the reference input level but often fail to account for closed-loop system dynamics, potentially leading to constraint violations during transients. This paper introduces a new approach to the flight envelope protection problem by employing a quadratic programming-based safety filter using control barrier functions to dynamically enforce flight envelope constraints while preserving control performance. Unlike traditional reference filtering methods, the control barrier function-based safety filter actively ensures strict forward invariance of the safe flight envelope set, integrating seamlessly with existing control architectures. The proposed framework is implemented in a nonlinear missile flight control system and evaluated in a simulated environment. The results demonstrate its ability to prevent constraint violations while minimizing conservatism, offering a robust alternative to existing flight envelope protection methodologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 12 figures, submitted to the AIAA Journal of Guidance, Control, and Dynamics as an Engineering Note</p></details> |

On the one hand, the analysis needs to be precise enough to draw meaningful conclusions. On the other hand, relevant programs in practice are large and require substantial abstraction. It is this inherent trade-off that is the crux of the problem. In this work, we present AProVE, a tool that uses symbolic execution to analyze termination of memory-manipulating C programs. While traditionally, AProVE's focus was on the preciseness of the analysis, we describe how we adapted our approach towards a modular analysis. Due to this adaption, our approach can now also handle recursive programs. Moreover, we present further performance improvements which we developed to make AProVE scale to large programs.</p></details> |  |

To address these, we introduce PAJAMA (Program-As-a-Judge for Automated Model Assessment), a new alternative that uses LLMs to synthesize executable judging programs instead of directly scoring responses. These synthesized programs can be stored and run locally, costing orders of magnitude less while providing interpretable, and auditable judging logic that can be easily adapted. Program-based judges mitigate biases, improving judgment consistency by 15.83% and reducing biased responses by 23.7% on average compared to a Qwen2.5-14B-based LLM-as-a-judge. When program judgments are distilled into a model, PAJAMA outperforms LLM-as-a-judge on the challenging CHAT-HARD subset of RewardBench, outperforming metrics by 2.19% on Prometheus and 8.67% on the JudgeLM dataset, all at three orders of magnitude lower cost.</p></details> |  |

Recently, machine learning (ML)-guided approaches have demonstrated significant potential in improving MILP-solving efficiency. However, these methods typically rely on separate offline data collection and training processes, which limits their scalability and adaptability. This paper introduces the first multi-task learning framework for ML-guided MILP solving. The proposed framework provides MILP embeddings helpful in guiding MILP solving across solvers (e.g., Gurobi and SCIP) and across tasks (e.g., Branching and Solver configuration). Through extensive experiments on three widely used MILP benchmarks, we demonstrate that our multi-task learning model performs similarly to specialized models within the same distribution. Moreover, it significantly outperforms them in generalization across problem sizes and tasks.</p></details> |  |

Recently, learning-based approaches have shown a potential to speed up MIP solving via offline training that then guides important design decisions during the search. However, a significant drawback of these methods is their heavy reliance on offline training, which requires collecting training datasets and computationally costly training epochs yet offering only limited generalization to unseen (larger) instances. In this paper, we propose Balans, an adaptive meta-solver for MIPs with online learning capability that does not require any supervision or apriori training. At its core, Balans is based on adaptive large-neighborhood search, operating on top of an MIP solver by successive applications of destroy and repair neighborhood operators. During the search, the selection among different neighborhood definitions is guided on the fly for the instance at hand via multi-armed bandit algorithms. Our extensive experiments on hard optimization instances show that Balans offers significant performance gains over the default MIP solver, is better than committing to any single best neighborhood, and improves over the state-of-the-art large-neighborhood search for MIPs. Finally, we release Balans as a highly configurable, MIP solver agnostic, open-source software.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Effects of GitHub Copilot on Computing Students' Programming Effectiveness, Efficiency, and Processes in Brownfield Programming Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10051v1)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When graduates of computing degree programs enter the software industry, they will most likely join teams working on legacy code bases developed by people other than themselves. In these so-called brownfield software development settings, generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) coding assistants like GitHub Copilot are rapidly transforming software development practices, yet the impact of GenAI on student programmers performing brownfield development tasks remains underexplored. This paper investigates how GitHub Copilot influences undergraduate students' programming performance, behaviors, and understanding when completing brownfield programming tasks in which they add new code to an unfamiliar code base. We conducted a controlled experiment in which 10 undergraduate computer science students completed highly similar brownfield development tasks with and without Copilot in a legacy web application. Using a mixed-methods approach combining performance analysis, behavioral analysis, and exit interviews, we found that students completed tasks 35% faster (p < 0.05) and made 50% more solution progress p (< 0.05) when using Copilot. Moreover, our analysis revealed that, when using Copilot, students spent 11% less time manually writing code (p < 0.05), and 12% less time conducting web searches (p < 0.05), providing evidence of a fundamental shift in how they engaged in programming. In exit interviews, students reported concerns about not understanding how or why Copilot suggestions work. This research suggests the need for computing educators to develop new pedagogical approaches that leverage GenAI assistants' benefits while fostering reflection on how and why GenAI suggestions address brownfield programming tasks. Complete study results and analysis are presented at https://ghcopilot-icer.github.io/.</p></details> | 14 pages, 5 figures |

Our approach first regularizes the primal problem with the von Neumann entropy, then solve the regularized problem using dual gradient ascent with respect to a problem-adapted norm. In particular, we show that the dual gradient norm converges to zero at a rate independent of the ambient dimension and, via rounding arguments, construct primal-feasible solutions in certain special cases. We also derive explicit convergence rates for the objective. In order to achieve optimal computational scaling, we must accommodate the use of stochastic gradients constructed via randomized trace estimators. Throughout we illustrate the generality of our framework via three important special cases -- the Goemans-Williamson SDP relaxation of the Max-Cut problem, the optimal transport linear program, and several SDP relaxations of the permutation synchronization problem. Numerical experiments confirm that our methods achieve dimension-independent convergence in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Boosting Rust Unit Test Coverage through Hybrid Program Analysis and Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09002v2)** | 2025-06-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unit testing is essential for ensuring software reliability and correctness. Classic Search-Based Software Testing (SBST) methods and concolic execution-based approaches for generating unit tests often fail to achieve high coverage due to difficulties in handling complex program units, such as branching conditions and external dependencies. Recent work has increasingly utilized large language models (LLMs) to generate test cases, improving the quality of test generation by providing better context and correcting errors in the model's output. However, these methods rely on fixed prompts, resulting in relatively low compilation success rates and coverage. This paper presents PALM, an approach that leverages large language models (LLMs) to enhance the generation of high-coverage unit tests. PALM performs program analysis to identify branching conditions within functions, which are then combined into path constraints. These constraints and relevant contextual information are used to construct prompts that guide the LLMs in generating unit tests. We implement the approach and evaluate it in 10 open-source Rust crates. Experimental results show that within just two or three hours, PALM can significantly improves test coverage compared to classic methods, with increases in overall project coverage exceeding 50% in some instances and its generated tests achieving an average coverage of 75.77%, comparable to human effort (71.30%), highlighting the potential of LLMs in automated test generation. We submitted 91 PALM-generated unit tests targeting new code. Of these submissions, 80 were accepted, 5 were rejected, and 6 remain pending review. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of integrating program analysis with AI and open new avenues for future research in automated software testing.</p></details> | 10 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Causal Graph Recovery in Neuroimaging through Answer Set Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.09286v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning graphical causal structures from time series data presents significant challenges, especially when the measurement frequency does not match the causal timescale of the system. This often leads to a set of equally possible underlying causal graphs due to information loss from sub-sampling (i.e., not observing all possible states of the system throughout time). Our research addresses this challenge by incorporating the effects of sub-sampling in the derivation of causal graphs, resulting in more accurate and intuitive outcomes. We use a constraint optimization approach, specifically answer set programming (ASP), to find the optimal set of answers. ASP not only identifies the most probable underlying graph, but also provides an equivalence class of possible graphs for expert selection. In addition, using ASP allows us to leverage graph theory to further prune the set of possible solutions, yielding a smaller, more accurate answer set significantly faster than traditional approaches. We validate our approach on both simulated data and empirical structural brain connectivity, and demonstrate its superiority over established methods in these experiments. We further show how our method can be used as a meta-approach on top of established methods to obtain, on average, 12% improvement in F1 score. In addition, we achieved state of the art results in terms of precision and recall of reconstructing causal graph from sub-sampled time series data. Finally, our method shows robustness to varying degrees of sub-sampling on realistic simulations, whereas other methods perform worse for higher rates of sub-sampling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can LLMs Generate Reliable Test Case Generators? A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821v2)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |
| **[Program Synthesis from Partial Traces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.14480v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present the first technique to synthesize programs that compose side-effecting functions, pure functions, and control flow, from partial traces containing records of only the side-effecting functions. This technique can be applied to synthesize API composing scripts from logs of calls made to those APIs, or a script from traces of system calls made by a workload, for example. All of the provided traces are positive examples, meaning that they describe desired behavior. Our approach does not require negative examples. Instead, it generalizes over the examples and uses cost metrics to prevent over-generalization. Because the problem is too complex for traditional monolithic program synthesis techniques, we propose a new combination of optimizing rewrites and syntax-guided program synthesis. The resulting program is correct by construction, so its output will always be able to reproduce the input traces. We evaluate the quality of the programs synthesized when considering various optimization metrics and the synthesizer's efficiency on real-world benchmarks. The results show that our approach can generate useful real-world programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at PLDI 2025 (46th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation)</p></details> |
| **[Relational decomposition for program synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12212v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a relational approach to program synthesis. The key idea is to decompose synthesis tasks into simpler relational synthesis subtasks. Specifically, our representation decomposes a training input-output example into sets of input and output facts respectively. We then learn relations between the input and output facts. We demonstrate our approach using an off-the-shelf inductive logic programming (ILP) system on four challenging synthesis datasets. Our results show that (i) our representation can outperform a standard one, and (ii) an off-the-shelf ILP system with our representation can outperform domain-specific approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cross-lingual Transfer in Programming Languages: An Extensive Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.16937v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various software engineering tasks, including error detection, clone detection, and code translation, primarily leveraging high-resource programming languages like Python and Java. However, many critical languages, such as COBOL, as well as emerging languages, such as Rust and Swift, remain low-resource due to limited openly available code. This scarcity hampers the training and effectiveness of LLMs for these languages, increasing software maintenance costs and stifling innovation. Addressing this gap, we investigate the potential of transfer learning to enhance LLM performance on low-resource programming languages by leveraging data from high-resource counterparts. Our extensive empirical study evaluates transferability across 10 to 41 programming languages and five key tasks: code generation, clone detection, code repair, solution domain classification, and error detection. Additionally, we develop a performance prediction model to guess the best source languages for a given target and task, and analyze the features that influence transfer performance. We further replicate a representative subset of experiments with a larger model to test the generalizability of our conclusions to contemporary large-scale LLMs. Our findings demonstrate that cross-lingual transfer significantly outperforms zero-shot learning, with effectiveness varying based on both source and target languages. Furthermore, our model reliably predicts successful transfer sources by considering linguistic and dataset-specific features, offering practical guidance for data acquisition and model training. This work contributes to the development of LLM-driven tools for low-resource programming languages and provides insights into the characteristics that facilitate transfer across language pairs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Transactions on Machine Learning Research (06/2025) 26 pages, 5 figures, 10 tables</p></details> |

The advanced capabilities of LLM-based programming assistants to support software development tasks have led to a rise in the adoption of LLMs in SE. However, little is known about the evidenced-based practices, tools and processes verified by research findings, supported and adopted by AI programming assistants. To this end, our work conducts a preliminary evaluation exploring the beliefs of LLM used to support software development tasks. We investigate 17 evidence-based claims posited by empirical SE research across five LLM-based programming assistants. Our findings show that LLM-based programming assistants have ambiguous beliefs regarding research claims and lack credible evidence to support responses. Based on our results, we provide implications for practitioners adopting LLM-based programming assistants in development contexts and shed light on future research directions to enhance the reliability and trustworthiness of LLMs -- aiming to increase awareness and adoption of evidence-based SE research findings in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Outcome Logic: A Unified Approach to the Metatheory of Program Logics with Branching Effects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.04594v3)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Starting with Hoare Logic over 50 years ago, numerous program logics have been devised to reason about the diverse programs encountered in the real world. This includes reasoning about computational effects, particularly those effects that cause the program execution to branch into multiple paths due to, e.g., nondeterministic or probabilistic choice. The recently introduced Outcome Logic reimagines Hoare Logic with branching at its core, using an algebraic representation of choice to capture programs that branch into many outcomes. In this article, we expand on prior Outcome Logic papers in order to give a more authoritative and comprehensive account of the metatheory. This includes a relatively complete proof system for Outcome Logic with the ability to reason about general purpose looping. We also show that this proof system applies to programs with various types of branching and that it facilitates the reuse of proof fragments across different kinds of specifications.</p></details> |  |

To improve the interpretability and transparency in control systems, models can be defined as white-box symbolic policies described by mathematical expressions. For better performance in partially observable and volatile environments, the symbolic policies are extended with memory represented by continuous-time latent variables, governed by differential equations. Genetic programming is used for optimisation, resulting in interpretable policies consisting of symbolic expressions. Our results show that symbolic policies with memory compare with black-box policies on a variety of control tasks. Furthermore, the benefit of the memory in symbolic policies is demonstrated on experiments where memory-less policies fall short. Overall, we present a method for evolving high-performing symbolic policies that offer interpretability and transparency, which lacks in black-box models.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages including references and appendix, 7 figures, 1 algorithm, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Linguine: A Natural-Language Programming Language with Formal Semantics and a Clean Compiler Pipeline](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08396v1)** | 2025-06-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linguine is a natural-language-inspired programming language that enables users to write programs in a fluent, controlled subset of English while preserving formal semantics. The language introduces anaphoric constructs, such as pronoun variables (e.g., "it", "them"), that are statically resolved through referent-tracking analysis combined with a Hindley-Milner-style type system. Each pronoun is guaranteed to be unambiguous and well-typed at compile time. The Linguine compiler pipeline includes lexing, parsing, clause graph construction, desugaring into a typed intermediate representation, type inference, and abstract interpretation. This enables the early detection of semantic errors, such as undefined or type-inconsistent references. A lightweight backend currently generates Python code. This paper formalizes the core language, defines its typing and operational semantics, and proves the soundness of its pronoun resolution mechanism. An initial evaluation shows that Linguine allows the expression of concise and readable programs while supporting static verification. Linguine represents a step toward programming systems that prioritize human linguistic intuition while remaining grounded in formal methods and type-theoretic rigor.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compiling Metric Temporal Answer Set Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08150v1)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a computational approach to Metric Answer Set Programming (ASP) to allow for expressing quantitative temporal constrains, like durations and deadlines. A central challenge is to maintain scalability when dealing with fine-grained timing constraints, which can significantly exacerbate ASP's grounding bottleneck. To address this issue, we leverage extensions of ASP with difference constraints, a simplified form of linear constraints, to handle time-related aspects externally. Our approach effectively decouples metric ASP from the granularity of time, resulting in a solution that is unaffected by time precision.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reliable Collaborative Conversational Agent System Based on LLMs and Answer Set Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06438v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the Large-Language-Model-driven (LLM-driven) Artificial Intelligence (AI) bots became popular, people realized their strong potential in Task-Oriented Dialogue (TOD). However, bots relying wholly on LLMs are unreliable in their knowledge, and whether they can finally produce a correct outcome for the task is not guaranteed. The collaboration among these agents also remains a challenge, since the necessary information to convey is unclear, and the information transfer is by prompts: unreliable, and malicious knowledge is easy to inject. With the help of knowledge representation and reasoning tools such as Answer Set Programming (ASP), conversational agents can be built safely and reliably, and communication among the agents made more reliable as well. We propose a Manager-Customer-Service Dual-Agent paradigm, where ASP-driven bots share the same knowledge base and complete their assigned tasks independently. The agents communicate with each other through the knowledge base, ensuring consistency. The knowledge and information conveyed are encapsulated and invisible to the users, ensuring the security of information transmission. To illustrate the dual-agent conversational paradigm, we have constructed AutoManager, a collaboration system for managing the drive-through window of a fast-food restaurant such as Taco Bell in the US. In AutoManager, the customer service bot takes the customer's order while the manager bot manages the menu and food supply. We evaluated our AutoManager system and compared it with the real-world Taco Bell Drive-Thru AI Order Taker, and the results show that our method is more reliable.</p></details> | 9 pages |

To aid debugging, program reduction techniques try to produce a smaller variant of the input program that still triggers the bug. However, existing execution-unaware program reduction techniques struggle with large and complex Wasm programs, because they rely on static information and apply syntactic transformations, while ignoring the valuable information offered by the input program's execution behavior. We present RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce, novel execution-aware program reduction techniques that leverage execution behaviors via record and replay. RR-Reduce identifies a bug-triggering function as the target function, isolates that function from the rest of the program, and generates a reduced program that replays only the interactions between the target function and the rest of the program. Hybrid-Reduce combines a complementary execution-unaware reduction technique with RR-Reduce to further reduce program size. We evaluate RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce on 28 Wasm programs that trigger a diverse set of bugs in three engines. On average, RR-Reduce reduces the programs to 1.20 percent of their original size in 14.5 minutes, which outperforms the state of the art by 33.15 times in terms of reduction time. Hybrid-Reduce reduces the programs to 0.13 percent of their original size in 3.5 hours, which outperforms the state of the art by 3.42 times in terms of reduced program size and 2.26 times in terms of reduction time. We envision RR-Reduce as the go-to tool for rapid, on-demand debugging in minutes, and Hybrid-Reduce for scenarios where developers require the smallest possible programs.</p></details> |  |
| **[MacroSwarm: A Field-based Compositional Framework for Swarm Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.10969v4)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Swarm behaviour engineering is an area of research that seeks to investigate methods and techniques for coordinating computation and action within groups of simple agents to achieve complex global goals like pattern formation, collective movement, clustering, and distributed sensing. Despite recent progress in the analysis and engineering of swarms (of drones, robots, vehicles), there is still a need for general design and implementation methods and tools that can be used to define complex swarm behaviour in a principled way. To contribute to this quest, this article proposes a new field-based coordination approach, called MacroSwarm, to design and program swarm behaviour in terms of reusable and fully composable functional blocks embedding collective computation and coordination. Based on the macroprogramming paradigm of aggregate computing, MacroSwarm builds on the idea of expressing each swarm behaviour block as a pure function, mapping sensing fields into actuation goal fields, e.g., including movement vectors. In order to demonstrate the expressiveness, compositionality, and practicality of MacroSwarm as a framework for swarm programming, we perform a variety of simulations covering common patterns of flocking, pattern formation, and collective decision-making. The implications of the inherent self-stabilisation properties of field-based computations in MacroSwarm are discussed, which formally guarantee some resilience properties and guided the design of the library.</p></details> |  |

First, we show that there is no distributed quantum advantage for any linear program. Put otherwise, if there is a quantum-LOCAL algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ that finds an $\alpha$-approximation of some linear optimization problem $\Pi$ in $T$ communication rounds, we can construct a classical, deterministic LOCAL algorithm $\mathcal{A}'$ that finds an $\alpha$-approximation of $\Pi$ in $T$ rounds. As a corollary, all classical lower bounds for linear programs, including the KMW bound, hold verbatim in quantum-LOCAL. Second, using the above result, we show that there exists a locally checkable labeling problem (LCL) for which quantum-LOCAL is strictly weaker than the classical deterministic SLOCAL model. Our results extend from quantum-LOCAL also to finitely dependent and non-signaling distributions, and one of the corollaries of our work is that the non-signaling model and the SLOCAL model are incomparable in the context of LCL problems: By prior work, there exists an LCL problem for which SLOCAL is strictly weaker than the non-signaling model, and our work provides a separation in the opposite direction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pel, A Programming Language for Orchestrating AI Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13453v2)** | 2025-06-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The proliferation of Large Language Models (LLMs) has opened new frontiers in computing, yet controlling and orchestrating their capabilities beyond simple text generation remains a challenge. Current methods, such as function/tool calling and direct code generation, suffer from limitations in expressiveness, scalability, cost, security, and the ability to enforce fine-grained control. This paper introduces Pel, a novel programming language specifically designed to bridge this gap. Inspired by the strengths of Lisp, Elixir, Gleam, and Haskell, Pel provides a syntactically simple, homoiconic, and semantically rich platform for LLMs to express complex actions, control flow, and inter-agent communication safely and efficiently. Pel's design emphasizes a minimal, easily modifiable grammar suitable for constrained LLM generation, eliminating the need for complex sandboxing by enabling capability control at the syntax level. Key features include a powerful piping mechanism for linear composition, first-class closures enabling easy partial application and functional patterns, built-in support for natural language conditions evaluated by LLMs, and an advanced Read-Eval-Print-Loop (REPeL) with Common Lisp-style restarts and LLM-powered helper agents for automated error correction. Furthermore, Pel incorporates automatic parallelization of independent operations via static dependency analysis, crucial for performant agentic systems. We argue that Pel offers a more robust, secure, and expressive paradigm for LLM orchestration, paving the way for more sophisticated and reliable AI agentic frameworks.</p></details> | <details><summary>1.

These so-called state preparation algorithms are essential to the behavior of quantum algorithms, and complicated state preparation algorithms are difficult to develop correctly and effectively. This paper presents Pqasm: a high-assurance framework implemented with the Coq proof assistant, allowing us to certify our Pqasm tool to correctly reflect quantum program behaviors. The key in the framework is to reduce the program correctness assurance of a program containing a quantum superposition state to the program correctness assurance for the program state without superposition. The reduction allows the development of an effective testing framework for testing quantum state preparation algorithm implementations on a classical computer - considered to be a hard problem with no clear solution until this point. We utilize the QuickChick property-based testing framework to test state preparation programs. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach over 5 case studies implemented using Pqasm; such cases are not even simulatable in the current quantum simulators.</p></details> | Version 3 |
| **[Object-Spatial Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15812v6)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of programming languages from low-level assembly to high-level abstractions demonstrates a fundamental principle: by constraining how programmers express computation and enriching semantic information at the language level, we can make previously undecidable program properties tractable for optimization. Building on the insight of this undecidability-lessening effect, we introduce Object-Spatial Programming (OSP), a novel programming model that extends Object-Oriented Programming by introducing topologically-aware class constructs called archetypes. OSP fundamentally inverts the traditional relationship between data and computation, enabling computation to move to data through four specialized archetypes: object classes, node classes (discrete data locations), edge classes (first-class relationships), and walker classes (mobile computational entities). By making topological relationships and traversal patterns explicit at the language level, OSP transforms previously opaque program behaviors into observable, optimizable patterns. This semantic enhancement enables runtime systems to make informed decisions about data locality, parallel execution, and distribution strategies based on explicit topology, while providing programmers with intuitive abstractions for modeling complex systems where connection topology is central to the computational model. The paradigm addresses fundamental limitations in traditional programming models when representing agent-based systems, social networks, neural networks, distributed systems, finite state machines, and other spatially-oriented computational problems, demonstrating how thoughtful abstraction design can simultaneously enhance programmer expressiveness and enable sophisticated system-level optimizations across the computing stack.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 45 pages with appendix</p></details> |

In the standard quantum circuit model, adding a 1-qubit basis-changing gate -- commonly chosen to be the Hadamard gate -- to a universal set of classical reversible gates yields computationally universal quantum computation. However, the computational behaviours enabled by this addition are not fully characterised. We give such a characterisation by introducing a small quantum programming language extending the universal classical reversible programming language $\Pi$ with a single primitive corresponding to the Hadamard gate. The language comes equipped with a sound and complete categorical semantics that is specified by a purely equational theory, enabling reasoning about the equivalence of quantum programs in a way that can be automated. Completeness is shown by means of a novel finite presentation, and corresponding synthesis algorithm, for the groups of orthogonal matrices with entries in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]$.</p></details> | 116 pages |

Whereas semantics for concurrent or randomized programs in isolation is well studied, their combination has not been thoroughly explored and presents unique challenges. The crux of the problem is that interactions between control flow, probabilistic actions, and concurrent execution cannot be captured by straightforward generalizations of prior work on pomsets and convex languages, prominent models for those effects, individually. Our model has good domain theoretic properties, important for semantics of unbounded loops. We also prove two adequacy theorems, showing that the model subsumes typical powerdomain semantics for concurrency and convex powerdomain semantics for probabilistic nondeterminism.</p></details> |  |
| **[Denoising Programming Knowledge Tracing with a Code Graph-based Tuning Adaptor](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11107v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Programming Knowledge Tracking (PKT) aims to dynamically diagnose learners' mastery levels of programming knowledge based on their coding activities, facilitating more effective and personalized programming education. However, current PKT studies primarily focus on the implicit relationship between code content and knowledge assessment, often overlooking two types of noise signals in long-term programming activities: unwanted signals from unrelated submissions and weak signals from minor modifications. This practical challenge significantly limits model performance and application. To address this issue, we propose Coda, a Code graph-based tuning adaptor designed to enhance existing PKT models by identifying and mitigating the impact of noise. Specifically, Coda first transforms the loose code sequences submitted by each learner into a compact code graph. By leveraging this code graph, unwanted signals can be identified from a semantic similarity perspective. We then apply a cluster-aware GCN to the code graph, which improves the discrimination of weak signals and enables their clustering for identification. Finally, a lightweight yet effective adaptor is incorporated into the PKT task through optimization with two noise feature-based constraints and a navigational regularization term, to correct knowledge states affected by noise. It is worth mentioning that the Coda framework is model-agnostic and can be adapted to most existing PKT solutions. Extensive experimental results on four real-world datasets demonstrate that Coda effectively performs the PKT task in the presence of noisy programming records, outperforming typical baselines.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by KDD August 2025</p></details> |
| **[SDP-CROWN: Efficient Bound Propagation for Neural Network Verification with Tightness of Semidefinite Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06665v1)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural network verifiers based on linear bound propagation scale impressively to massive models but can be surprisingly loose when neuron coupling is crucial. Conversely, semidefinite programming (SDP) verifiers capture inter-neuron coupling naturally, but their cubic complexity restricts them to only small models. In this paper, we propose SDP-CROWN, a novel hybrid verification framework that combines the tightness of SDP relaxations with the scalability of bound-propagation verifiers. At the core of SDP-CROWN is a new linear bound, derived via SDP principles, that explicitly captures $\ell_{2}$-norm-based inter-neuron coupling while adding only one extra parameter per layer. This bound can be integrated seamlessly into any linear bound-propagation pipeline, preserving the inherent scalability of such methods yet significantly improving tightness. In theory, we prove that our inter-neuron bound can be up to a factor of $\sqrt{n}$ tighter than traditional per-neuron bounds. In practice, when incorporated into the state-of-the-art $\alpha$-CROWN verifier, we observe markedly improved verification performance on large models with up to 65 thousand neurons and 2.47 million parameters, achieving tightness that approaches that of costly SDP-based methods.</p></details> | ICML 2025 |
| **[Q-WSL: Optimizing Goal-Conditioned RL with Weighted Supervised Learning via Dynamic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06648v5)** | 2025-06-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel class of advanced algorithms, termed Goal-Conditioned Weighted Supervised Learning (GCWSL), has recently emerged to tackle the challenges posed by sparse rewards in goal-conditioned reinforcement learning (RL). GCWSL consistently delivers strong performance across a diverse set of goal-reaching tasks due to its simplicity, effectiveness, and stability. However, GCWSL methods lack a crucial capability known as trajectory stitching, which is essential for learning optimal policies when faced with unseen skills during testing. This limitation becomes particularly pronounced when the replay buffer is predominantly filled with sub-optimal trajectories. In contrast, traditional TD-based RL methods, such as Q-learning, which utilize Dynamic Programming, do not face this issue but often experience instability due to the inherent difficulties in value function approximation. In this paper, we propose Q-learning Weighted Supervised Learning (Q-WSL), a novel framework designed to overcome the limitations of GCWSL by incorporating the strengths of Dynamic Programming found in Q-learning. Q-WSL leverages Dynamic Programming results to output the optimal action of (state, goal) pairs across different trajectories within the replay buffer. This approach synergizes the strengths of both Q-learning and GCWSL, effectively mitigating their respective weaknesses and enhancing overall performance. Empirical evaluations on challenging goal-reaching tasks demonstrate that Q-WSL surpasses other goal-conditioned approaches in terms of both performance and sample efficiency. Additionally, Q-WSL exhibits notable robustness in environments characterized by binary reward structures and environmental stochasticity.</p></details> |  |
| **[MergeRepair: An Exploratory Study on Merging Task-Specific Adapters in Code LLMs for Automated Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.09568v3)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown high capabilities in several software development-related tasks such as program repair, documentation, code refactoring, debugging, and testing. However, training these models requires massive amount of data and significant computational resources. Adapters are specialized, small modules designed for parameter efficient fine-tuning of LLMs for specific tasks, domains, or applications without requiring extensive retraining of the entire model. These adapters offer a more efficient way to customize LLMs for particular needs, leveraging the pre-existing capabilities of the large model. Model (and adapter) merging have emerged as a technique to develop one model capable of multiple tasks, with minimal or no training required. Although model and adapter merging has shown promising performance in domains such as natural language processing and computer vision, its applicability to software engineering tasks remains underexplored. In this paper, we investigate the effectiveness of merged adapters within the context of software engineering, with a particular focus on the Automated Program Repair (APR) task, through our approach, MergeRepair. In particular, we merge multiple task-specific adapters using three different merging methods, including weight-averaging, ties, and dare-ties, and evaluate the performance of the merged adapter on the APR task. We introduce a continual merging approach, a novel method in which we sequentially merge the task-specific adapters where the order and weight of the merged adapters play a significant role. We further compare the performance of our approach with a baseline method consisting of equal-weight merging applied on parameters of different adapters, where all adapters are of equal importance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integer Linear Programming Preprocessing for Maximum Satisfiability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06216v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Maximum Satisfiability problem (MaxSAT) is a major optimization challenge with numerous practical applications. In recent MaxSAT evaluations, most MaxSAT solvers have adopted an ILP solver as part of their portfolios. This paper investigates the impact of Integer Linear Programming (ILP) preprocessing techniques on MaxSAT solving. Experimental results show that ILP preprocessing techniques help WMaxCDCL-OpenWbo1200, the winner of the MaxSAT evaluation 2024 in the unweighted track, solve 15 additional instances. Moreover, current state-of-the-art MaxSAT solvers heavily use an ILP solver in their portfolios, while our proposed approach reduces the need to call an ILP solver in a portfolio including WMaxCDCL or MaxCDCL.</p></details> |  |

To narrow this gap, we explore program-based TR (P-TR), which circumvents key limitations of text-based TR (T-TR), notably in numerical reasoning, by generating executable programs. However, applying P-TR to SLMs introduces two challenges: (i) vulnerability to heterogeneity in table layouts, and (ii) inconsistency in reasoning due to limited code generation capability. We propose Table-r1, a two-stage P-TR method designed for SLMs. Stage 1 introduces an innovative self-supervised learning task, Layout Transformation Inference, to improve tabular layout generalization from a programmatic view. Stage 2 adopts a mix-paradigm variant of Group Relative Policy Optimization, enhancing P-TR consistency while allowing dynamic fallback to T-TR when needed. Experiments on four TR benchmarks demonstrate that Table-r1 outperforms all SLM-based methods, achieving at least a 15% accuracy improvement over the base model (LLaMA-8B) across all datasets and reaching performance competitive with LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convergence of linear programming hierarchies for Gibbs states of spin systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06125v1)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of computing expectation values of local functions under the Gibbs distribution of a spin system. In particular, we study two families of linear programming hierarchies for this problem. The first hierarchy imposes local spin flip equalities and has been considered in the bootstrap literature in high energy physics. For this hierarchy, we prove fast convergence under a spatial mixing (decay of correlations) condition. This condition is satisfied for example above the critical temperature for Ising models on a $d$-dimensional grid. The second hierarchy is based on a Markov chain having the Gibbs state as a fixed point and has been studied in the optimization literature and more recently in the bootstrap literature. For this hierarchy, we prove fast convergence provided the Markov chain mixes rapidly. Both hierarchies lead to an $\varepsilon$-approximation for local expectation values using a linear program of size quasi-polynomial in $n/\varepsilon$, where $n$ is the total number of sites, provided the interactions can be embedded in a $d$-dimensional grid with constant $d$. Compared to standard Monte Carlo methods, an advantage of this approach is that it always (i.e., for any system) outputs rigorous upper and lower bounds on the expectation value of interest, without needing an a priori analysis of the convergence speed.</p></details> | 11 pages |

However, generating comprehensive test cases to effectively assess programming solutions remains resource-intensive and challenging for educators. This paper introduces an innovative NLP-driven method leveraging generative AI (large language models) to automate the creation of high-quality test cases for competitive programming assessments. We extensively evaluated our approach on diverse datasets, including 25 years of Romanian Informatics Olympiad (OJI) data for 5th graders, recent competitions hosted on the Kilonova.ro platform, and the International Informatics Olympiad in Teams (IIOT). Our results demonstrate that AI-generated test cases substantially enhanced assessments, notably identifying previously undetected errors in 67% of the OJI 5th grade programming problems. These improvements underscore the complementary educational value of our technique in formative assessment contexts. By openly sharing our prompts, translated datasets, and methodologies, we offer practical NLP-based tools that educators and contest organizers can readily integrate to enhance assessment quality, reduce workload, and deepen insights into learner performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 2 chart pies, 1 figure Pre-print version Accepted at BEA 2025</p></details> |

Tubular structures naturally yield circular cross-sections when inflated, whereas a robotic sling must be both thin enough to grow between them and their resting surface and wide enough to cradle the human. Recent works have achieved flattened cross-sections by including rigid components into the structure, but this reduces conformability to the human. We present a method of mechanically programming the cross-section of soft everting robotic structures using flexible strips that constrain radial expansion between points along the outer membrane. Our method enables simultaneously wide and thin profiles while maintaining the full multi-axis flexibility of traditional slings. We develop and validate a model relating the geometric design specifications to the fabrication parameters, and experimentally characterize their effects on growth rate. Finally, we prototype a soft growing robotic sling system and demonstrate its use for assisting a single caregiver in bed-to-chair patient transfer.</p></details> |  |

This tight coupling makes GP solutions more fragile and prone to overfitting, reducing their ability to generalize. In this work, we propose LaSER (Latent Semantic Representation Regression)} -- a general framework that decouples representation evolution from lifetime learning. At each generation, candidate programs produce features which are passed to an external learner to model the target task. This approach enables any function approximator, from linear models to neural networks, to serve as a lifetime learner, allowing expressive modeling beyond conventional symbolic forms. Here we show for the first time that LaSER can outcompete standard GP and GP followed by linear regression when it employs non-linear methods to fit coefficients to GP-generated equations against complex data sets. Further, we explore how LaSER enables the emergence of innate representations, supporting long-standing hypotheses in evolutionary learning such as the Baldwin Effect. By separating the roles of representation and adaptation, LaSER offers a principled and extensible framework for symbolic regression and classification.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to Genetic Programming Theory and Practice (GPTP) 2025.

It is no longer necessary to be a computer specialist to use them. Paradoxically, the development of computer programs generally requires writing lines of code in a programming language whose syntax is particularly strict. This process poses many difficulties for programmers. We propose an original tool in which arbitrary programs (Turing-complete) can be developed in a completely visual manner by direct manipulation of the data, without writing a line of code. The user can thus develop an algorithm by directly visualizing the result of actions taken on the data. A method for constructing iterations is associated with the tool. It proposes to create each part, including the loop body, in a non-linear manner under visual control of the state of the data. In addition, the tool supports the production of lines of code in several languages including Python, C, Java, that correspond to the actions performed. In this article, we present the tool, the design choices, the problems to be solved, and the limits and the contributions of the direct-data-manipulation approach.</p></details> | in French language |

One of the domains of application of this type of analysis is cryptocurrency ledgers, both for the purpose of analyzing the behaviour of the ledger itself, and any user-defined programs called by it, known as smart contracts. The (extended) UTxO ledger model is a kind of ledger model where all smart contract code is stateless, and additional work must be done to model stateful programs. We formalize the application of trace-based analysis to UTxO ledgers and contracts, expressing it in the languages of topology, as well as graph and category theory. To describe valid traces of UTxO ledger executions, and their relation to the behaviour of stateful programs implemented on the ledger, we define a category of simple graphs, infinite paths in which form an ultra-metric space. Maps in this category are arbitrary partial sieve-define homomorphisms of simple graphs. Programs implemented on the ledger correspond to non-expanding maps out of the graph of valid UTxO execution traces. We reason about safety properties in this framework, and prove properties of valid UTxO ledger traces.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings LSFA 2024, arXiv:2506.05219</p></details> |
| **[Boolean matrix logic programming for active learning of gene functions in genome-scale metabolic network models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.06724v4)** | 2025-06-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning about hypotheses and updating knowledge through empirical observations are central to scientific discovery. In this work, we applied logic-based machine learning methods to drive biological discovery by guiding experimentation. Genome-scale metabolic network models (GEMs) - comprehensive representations of metabolic genes and reactions - are widely used to evaluate genetic engineering of biological systems. However, GEMs often fail to accurately predict the behaviour of genetically engineered cells, primarily due to incomplete annotations of gene interactions. The task of learning the intricate genetic interactions within GEMs presents computational and empirical challenges. To efficiently predict using GEM, we describe a novel approach called Boolean Matrix Logic Programming (BMLP) by leveraging Boolean matrices to evaluate large logic programs. We developed a new system, $BMLP_{active}$, which guides cost-effective experimentation and uses interpretable logic programs to encode a state-of-the-art GEM of a model bacterial organism. Notably, $BMLP_{active}$ successfully learned the interaction between a gene pair with fewer training examples than random experimentation, overcoming the increase in experimental design space. $BMLP_{active}$ enables rapid optimisation of metabolic models to reliably engineer biological systems for producing useful compounds. It offers a realistic approach to creating a self-driving lab for biological discovery, which would then facilitate microbial engineering for practical applications.</p></details> |  |

However, while a large amount of public problem data, such as problem statements and solutions, is available, the test cases of these problems are often difficult to obtain. Therefore, test case generation is a necessary task for building large-scale datasets, and the quality of the test cases directly determines the accuracy of the evaluation. In this paper, we introduce an LLM-based agent system that creates high-quality test cases for competitive programming problems. We apply this system to the CodeContests dataset and propose a new version with improved test cases, named CodeContests+. We evaluated the quality of test cases in CodeContestsPlus. First, we used 1.72 million submissions with pass/fail labels to examine the accuracy of these test cases in evaluation. The results indicated that CodeContests+ achieves significantly higher accuracy than CodeContests, particularly with a notably higher True Positive Rate (TPR). Subsequently, our experiments in LLM Reinforcement Learning (RL) further confirmed that improvements in test case quality yield considerable advantages for RL.</p></details> | 28 pages, 7 figures |

A key idea in Mirage is $\mu$Graphs, a uniform representation of tensor programs at the kernel, thread block, and thread levels of the GPU compute hierarchy. $\mu$Graphs enable Mirage to discover novel optimizations that combine algebraic transformations, schedule transformations, and generation of new custom kernels. To navigate the large search space, Mirage introduces a pruning technique based on abstraction that significantly reduces the search space and provides a certain optimality guarantee. To ensure that the optimized $\mu$Graph is equivalent to the input program, Mirage introduces a probabilistic equivalence verification procedure with strong theoretical guarantees. Our evaluation shows that Mirage outperforms existing approaches by up to 3.3$\times$ even for DNNs that are widely used and heavily optimized.

Finding a general methodology for verifying such programs is challenging due to both the number of different tools involved and the intricate interface between the ``neural'' and ``symbolic'' program components. In this paper we present a general decomposition of the neuro-symbolic verification problem into parts, and examine the problem of the embedding gap that occurs when one tries to combine proofs about the neural and symbolic components. To address this problem we then introduce Vehicle -- standing as an abbreviation for a ``verification condition language'' -- an intermediate programming language interface between machine learning frameworks, automated theorem provers, and dependently-typed formalisations of neuro-symbolic programs. Vehicle allows users to specify the properties of the neural components of neuro-symbolic programs once, and then safely compile the specification to each interface using a tailored typing and compilation procedure. We give a high-level overview of Vehicle's overall design, its interfaces and compilation & type-checking procedures, and then demonstrate its utility by formally verifying the safety of a simple autonomous car controlled by a neural network, operating in a stochastic environment with imperfect information.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pushe...</summary><p>Pushed in Formal Structures for Computation and Deduction 2025</p></details> |

In the literature, state partitioning abstractions based on (bi)simulation and property-preserving state relations have been successfully applied to abstract model checking. Here, we pursue a different track in which model checking is seen as an instance of program verification. To this purpose, we introduce a suitable language-called MOKA (for MOdel checking as abstract interpretation of Kleene Algebras)-which is used to encode temporal formulae as programs. In particular, we show that (universal fragments of) temporal logics, such as ACTL or, more generally, universal mu-calculus can be transformed into MOKA programs. Such programs return all and only the initial states which violate the formula. By applying abstract interpretation to MOKA programs, we pave the way for reusing more general abstractions than partitions as well as for tuning the precision of the abstraction to remove or avoid false alarms. We show how to perform model checking via a program logic that combines under-approximation and abstract interpretation analysis to avoid false alarms. The notion of locally complete abstraction is used to dynamically improve the analysis precision via counterexample-guided domain refinement.</p></details> |  |

Triton-distributed is the first compiler that supports native overlapping optimizations for distributed AI workloads, providing a good coverage of existing optimizations from different frameworks. First, we integrate communication primitives compliant with the OpenSHMEM standard into the compiler. This enables programmers to utilize these primitives with a higher-level Python programming model. Second, we illustrate how to achieve complex joint optimization of computation, memory access, and communication with the assistance of the compiler. In particular, we show how to use overlapping techniques to hide latency and present our compiler-based programming methods in both single-node and multi-node scenarios. Finally, we showcase the performance of the code generated by our compiler. In a test environment with up to 64 devices, our compiler can fully utilize heterogeneous communication and computation resources to provide effective overlapping and high performance. In many cases, the performance of the generated code can even outperform hand-optimized code. Moreover, the development difficulty and the time cost for development using our compiler are far less than those of low-level programming such as CUDA/C++, which clearly demonstrates significant productivity advantages.</p></details> |  |

We then develop an efficient method for handling verification conditions (VCs) of QEC programs: for Pauli errors, the VCs are reduced to classical assertions that can be solved by SMT solvers, and for non-Pauli errors, we provide a heuristic algorithm. We formalize the proposed program logic in Coq proof assistant, making it a verified QEC verifier. Additionally, we implement an automated QEC verifier, Veri-QEC, for verifying various fault-tolerant scenarios. We demonstrate the efficiency and broad functionality of the framework by performing different verification tasks across various scenarios.

As a special case of Quantified Constraint Satisfaction Problems (QCSP), QIP provides a versatile framework for addressing complex decision-making scenarios. Additionally, the inclusion of a linear objective function enables QIP to effectively model multistage robust discrete linear optimization problems, making it a powerful tool for tackling uncertainty in optimization. While two primary solution paradigms exist for QBF -- search-based and expansion-based approaches -- only search-based methods have been explored for QIP and QCSP. We introduce an expansion-based approach for QIP using Counterexample-Guided Abstraction Refinement (CEGAR), adapting techniques from QBF. We extend this methodology to tackle multistage robust discrete optimization problems with linear constraints and further embed it in an optimization framework, enhancing its applicability. Our experimental results highlight the advantages of this approach, demonstrating superior performance over existing search-based solvers for QIP in specific instances. Furthermore, the ability to model problems using linear constraints enables notable performance gains over state-of-the-art expansion-based solvers for QBF.</p></details> |  |

However, in the open ocean neither anchored farming nor floating farms with powerful engines are economically viable. Thus, a potential solution are farms that operate by going with the flow, utilizing minimal propulsion to strategically leverage beneficial ocean currents. In this work, we focus on low-power autonomous seaweed farms and design controllers that maximize seaweed growth by taking advantage of ocean currents. We first introduce a Dynamic Programming (DP) formulation to solve for the growth-optimal value function when the true currents are known. However, in reality only short-term imperfect forecasts with increasing uncertainty are available. Hence, we present three additional extensions. Firstly, we use frequent replanning to mitigate forecast errors. Second, to optimize for long-term growth, we extend the value function beyond the forecast horizon by estimating the expected future growth based on seasonal average currents. Lastly, we introduce a discounted finite-time DP formulation to account for the increasing uncertainty in future ocean current estimates. We empirically evaluate our approach with 30-day simulations of farms in realistic ocean conditions. Our method achieves 95.8\% of the best possible growth using only 5-day forecasts.This demonstrates that low-power propulsion is a promising method to operate autonomous seaweed farms in real-world conditions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, submitted to IEEE Robotics and Automation Letters (RA-L) Matthias Killer and Marius Wiggert contributed equally to this work</p></details> |

Our research highlights a key challenge: these models particularly struggle with structurally inconsistent edits that involve substantial layout changes. To mitigate this gap, we introduce Image Editing As Programs (IEAP), a unified image editing framework built upon the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture. At its core, IEAP approaches instructional editing through a reductionist lens, decomposing complex editing instructions into sequences of atomic operations. Each operation is implemented via a lightweight adapter sharing the same DiT backbone and is specialized for a specific type of edit. Programmed by a vision-language model (VLM)-based agent, these operations collaboratively support arbitrary and structurally inconsistent transformations. By modularizing and sequencing edits in this way, IEAP generalizes robustly across a wide range of editing tasks, from simple adjustments to substantial structural changes. Extensive experiments demonstrate that IEAP significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard benchmarks across various editing scenarios. In these evaluations, our framework delivers superior accuracy and semantic fidelity, particularly for complex, multi-step instructions. Codes are available at https://github.com/YujiaHu1109/IEAP.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we examine the applicability of LLMs for the related but relatively unexplored task of code-equivalence checking, i.e., given two programs, whether they are functionally equivalent or not. This is an important problem since benchmarking code equivalence can play a critical role in evaluating LLM capabilities for tasks such as code re-writing and code translation. Towards this end, we present CETBench - Code Equivalence with Transformations Benchmark, constructed via a repository of programs, where two programs in the repository may be solving the same or different tasks. Each instance in our dataset is obtained by taking a pair of programs in the repository and applying a random series of pre-defined code transformations, resulting in (non-)equivalent pairs. Our analysis on this dataset reveals a surprising finding that very simple code transformations in the underlying pair of programs can result in a significant drop in performance of SOTA LLMs for the task of code-equivalence checking. To remedy this, we present a simple fine-tuning-based approach to boost LLM performance on the transformed pairs of programs. Our approach for dataset generation is generic, and can be used with repositories with varying program difficulty levels and allows for applying varying numbers as well as kinds of transformations. In our experiments, we perform ablations over the difficulty level of original programs, as well as the kind of transformations used in generating pairs for equivalence checking. Our analysis presents deep insights into the working of LLMs for the task of code-equivalence, and points to the fact that they may still be far from what could be termed as a semantic understanding of the underlying code.</p></details> |  |

| **[Pseudorandom bits for non-commutative programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01832v2)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We obtain new explicit pseudorandom generators for several computational models involving groups. Our main results are as follows: 1. We consider read-once group-products over a finite group $G$, i.e., tests of the form $\prod_{i=1}^n g_i^{x_i}$ where $g_i\in G$, a special case of read-once permutation branching programs. We give generators with optimal seed length $c_G \log(n/\varepsilon)$ over any $p$-group. The proof uses the small-bias plus noise paradigm, but derandomizes the noise to avoid the recursion in previous work. Our generator works when the bits are read in any order. Previously for any non-commutative group the best seed length was $\ge\log n\log(1/\varepsilon)$, even for a fixed order. 2. We give a reduction that "lifts" suitable generators for group products over $G$ to a generator that fools width-$w$ block products, i.e., tests of the form $\prod g_i^{f_i}$ where the $f_i$ are arbitrary functions on disjoint blocks of $w$ bits. Block products generalize several previously studied classes. The reduction applies to groups that are mixing in a representation-theoretic sense that we identify. 3. Combining (2) with (1) and other works we obtain new generators for block products over the quaternions or over any commutative group, with nearly optimal seed length. In particular, we obtain generators for read-once polynomials modulo any fixed $m$ with nearly optimal seed length. Previously this was known only for $m=2$. 4. We give a new generator for products over "mixing groups." The construction departs from previous work and uses representation theory. For constant error, we obtain optimal seed length, improving on previous work (which applied to any group). This paper identifies a challenge in the area that is reminiscent of a roadblock in circuit complexity -- handling composite moduli -- and points to several classes of groups to be attacked next.</p></details> | Minor fixes |
| **[Boosting Open-Source LLMs for Program Repair via Reasoning Transfer and LLM-Guided Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.03921v1)** | 2025-06-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several closed-source LLMs have consistently outperformed open-source alternatives in program repair tasks, primarily due to their superior reasoning capabilities and extensive pre-training. This paper introduces Repairity, a novel three-stage methodology that significantly narrows this performance gap through reasoning extraction and reinforcement learning. Our approach: (1) systematically filters high-quality reasoning traces from closed-source models using correctness verification, (2) transfers this reasoning knowledge to open-source models via supervised fine-tuning, and (3) develops reinforcement learning with LLM-based feedback to further optimize performance. Empirical evaluation across multiple program repair benchmarks demonstrates that Repairity improves the performance of Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct, a base open source LLM, by 8.68\% on average, reducing the capability gap with Claude-Sonnet3.7, a state-of-the-art closed-source model, from 10.05% to 1.35%. Ablation studies confirm that both reasoning extraction and LLM-guided reinforcement learning contribute significantly to these improvements. Our methodology generalizes effectively to additional code-related tasks, enabling organizations to leverage high-quality program repair capabilities while maintaining the customizability, transparency, and deployment flexibility inherent to open-source models.</p></details> |  |
