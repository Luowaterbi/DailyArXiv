| **[Coding Schemes for the Noisy Torn Paper Channel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11501v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To make DNA a suitable medium for archival data storage, it is essential to consider the decay process of the strands observed in DNA storage systems. This paper studies the decay process as a probabilistic noisy torn paper channel (TPC), which first corrupts the bits of the transmitted sequence in a probabilistic manner by substitutions, then breaks the sequence into a set of noisy unordered substrings. The present work devises coding schemes for the noisy TPC by embedding markers in the transmitted sequence. We investigate the use of static markers and markers connected to the data in the form of hash functions. These two tools have also been recently exploited to tackle the noiseless TPC. Simulations show that static markers excel at higher substitution probabilities, while data-dependent markers are superior at lower noise levels. Both approaches achieve reconstruction rates exceeding $99\%$ with no false decodings observed, primarily limited by computational resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convergence Properties of Good Quantum Codes for Classical Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11498v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An important part of the information theory folklore had been about the output statistics of codes that achieve the capacity and how the empirical distributions compare to the output distributions induced by the optimal input in the channel capacity problem. Results for a variety of such empirical output distributions of good codes have been known in the literature, such as the comparison of the output distribution of the code to the optimal output distribution in vanishing and non-vanishing error probability cases. Motivated by these, we aim to achieve similar results for the quantum codes that are used for classical communication, that is the setting in which the classical messages are communicated through quantum codewords that pass through a noisy quantum channel. We first show the uniqueness of the optimal output distribution, to be able to talk more concretely about the optimal output distribution. Then, we extend the vanishing error probability results to the quantum case, by using techniques that are close in spirit to the classical case. We also extend non-vanishing error probability results to the quantum case on block codes, by using the second-order converses for such codes based on hypercontractivity results for the quantum generalized depolarizing semi-groups.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vendor-Aware Industrial Agents: RAG-Enhanced LLMs for Secure On-Premise PLC Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09122v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Programmable Logic Controllers are operated by proprietary code dialects; this makes it challenging to train coding assistants. Current LLMs are trained on large code datasets and are capable of writing IEC 61131-3 compatible code out of the box, but they neither know specific function blocks, nor related project code. Moreover, companies like Mitsubishi Electric and their customers do not trust cloud providers. Hence, an own coding agent is the desired solution to cope with this. In this study, we present our work on a low-data domain coding assistant solution for industrial use. We show how we achieved high quality code generation without fine-tuning large models and by fine-tuning small local models for edge device usage. Our tool lets several AI models compete with each other, uses reasoning, corrects bugs automatically and checks code validity by compiling it directly in the chat interface. We support our approach with an extensive evaluation that comes with code compilation statistics and user ratings. We found that a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) supported coding assistant can work in low-data domains by using extensive prompt engineering and directed retrieval.</p></details> | ICIT2026 |
| **[A Causal Perspective on Measuring, Explaining and Mitigating Smells in LLM-Generated Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15817v5)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated their adoption in software engineering contexts. However, concerns persist about the structural quality of the code they produce. In particular, LLMs often replicate poor coding practices, introducing code smells (i.e., patterns that hinder readability, maintainability, or design integrity). Although prior research has examined the detection or repair of smells, we still lack a clear understanding of how and when these issues emerge in generated code. This paper addresses this gap by systematically measuring, explaining and mitigating smell propensity in LLM-generated code. We build on the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), a probabilistic metric that estimates the likelihood of generating particular smell types, and establish its robustness as a signal of structural quality. Using PSC as an instrument for causal analysis, we identify how generation strategy, model size, model architecture and prompt formulation shape the structural properties of generated code. Our findings show that prompt design and architectural choices play a decisive role in smell propensity and motivate practical mitigation strategies that reduce its occurrence. A user study further demonstrates that PSC helps developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality, providing evidence that smell propensity signals can support human judgement. Taken together, our work lays the groundwork for integrating quality-aware assessments into the evaluation and deployment of LLMs for code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Idea First, Code Later: Disentangling Problem Solving from Code Generation in Evaluating LLMs for Competitive Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11332v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) increasingly succeed on competitive programming problems, yet existing evaluations conflate algorithmic reasoning with code-level implementation. We argue that competitive programming is fundamentally a problem-solving task and propose centering natural-language editorials in both solution generation and evaluation. Generating an editorial prior to code improves solve rates for some LLMs, with substantially larger gains when using expertly written gold editorials. However, even with gold editorials, models continue to struggle with implementation, while the gap between generated and gold editorials reveals a persistent problem-solving bottleneck in specifying correct and complete algorithms. Beyond pass/fail metrics, we diagnose reasoning errors by comparing model-generated editorials to gold standards using expert annotations and validate an LLM-as-a-judge protocol for scalable evaluation. We introduce a dataset of 83 ICPC-style problems with gold editorials and full test suites, and evaluate 19 LLMs, arguing that future benchmarks should explicitly separate problem solving from implementation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Construction Framework of Coded Caching Scheme for Multi-Access MISO Systems via Knapsack Problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10484v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the coded caching problem in a multi-access multiple-input single-output (MAMISO) network with the combinatorial topology. The considered system consists of a server containing $N$ files, $Λ$ cache nodes, and $K$ cache-less users, where each user can access a unique subset of $r$ cache nodes. The server is equipped with $L$ transmit antennas. Our objective is to design a caching scheme that simultaneously achieves a high sum Degree of Freedom (sum-DoF) and low subpacketization complexity. To address this challenge, we formulate the design of multi-antenna placement delivery arrays (MAPDA) as a $0$--$1$ knapsack problem to maximize the achievable DoF, thereby transforming the complex combinatorial caching structure into a tractable optimization framework that yields efficient cache placement and flexible delivery strategies. Theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate that: for networks with combinatorial topologies, the proposed scheme achieves a higher sum-DoF than existing schemes. Under identical cache size constraints, the subpacketization level remains comparable to existing linear subpacketization schemes. Moreover, under specific system conditions, the proposed scheme attains the theoretical maximum sum-DoF of $\min\{L+KM/N, K\}$ while achieving further reductions subpacketization. For particular combinatorial structures, we further derive optimized constructions that achieve even higher sum-DoF with lower subpacketization. ```</p></details> |  |
| **[ABC-Bench: Benchmarking Agentic Backend Coding in Real-World Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.11077v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The evolution of Large Language Models (LLMs) into autonomous agents has expanded the scope of AI coding from localized code generation to complex, repository-level, and execution-driven problem solving. However, current benchmarks predominantly evaluate code logic in static contexts, neglecting the dynamic, full-process requirements of real-world engineering, particularly in backend development which demands rigorous environment configuration and service deployment. To address this gap, we introduce ABC-Bench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate agentic backend coding within a realistic, executable workflow. Using a scalable automated pipeline, we curated 224 practical tasks spanning 8 languages and 19 frameworks from open-source repositories. Distinct from previous evaluations, ABC-Bench require the agents to manage the entire development lifecycle from repository exploration to instantiating containerized services and pass the external end-to-end API tests. Our extensive evaluation reveals that even state-of-the-art models struggle to deliver reliable performance on these holistic tasks, highlighting a substantial disparity between current model capabilities and the demands of practical backend engineering. Our code is available at https://github.com/OpenMOSS/ABC-Bench.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Low-Complexity Architecture for Multi-access Coded Caching Systems with Arbitrary User-cache Access Topology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10175v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper studies the multi-access coded caching (MACC) problem under arbitrary user-cache access topologies, extending existing models that rely on highly structured and combinatorially designed connectivity. We consider a MACC system consisting of a single server, multiple cache nodes, and multiple user nodes. Each user can access an arbitrary subset of cache nodes to retrieve cached content. The objective is to design a general and low-complexity delivery scheme under fixed cache placement for arbitrary access topologies. We propose a universal graph-based framework for modeling the MACC delivery problem, where decoding conflicts among requested packets are captured by a conflict graph and the delivery design is reduced to a graph coloring problem. In this formulation, a lower transmission load corresponds to using fewer colors. The classical greedy coloring algorithm DSatur achieves a transmission load close to the index-coding converse bound, providing a tight benchmark, but its computational complexity becomes prohibitive for large-scale graphs. To overcome this limitation, we develop a learning-based framework using graph neural networks that efficiently constructs near-optimal coded multicast transmissions and generalizes across diverse access topologies and varying numbers of users. In addition, we extend the index-coding converse bound for uncoded cache placement to arbitrary access topologies and propose a low-complexity greedy approximation. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed learning-based scheme achieves transmission loads close to those of DSatur and the converse bound while significantly reducing computational time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Stabilizer Code-Generic Universal Fault-Tolerant Quantum Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10964v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault-tolerant quantum computation allows quantum computations to be carried out while resisting unwanted noise. Several error correcting codes have been developed to achieve this task, but none alone are capable of universal quantum computation. This universality is highly desired and often achieved using additional techniques such as code concatenation, code switching, or magic state distillation, which can be costly and only work for specific codes. This work implements logical Clifford and T gates through novel ancilla-mediated protocols to construct a universal fault-tolerant quantum gate set. Unlike traditional techniques, our implementation is deterministic, does not consume ancilla registers, does not modify the underlying data codes or registers, and is generic over all stabilizer codes. Thus, any single code becomes capable of universal quantum computation by leveraging helper codes in ancilla registers and mid-circuit measurements. Furthermore, since these logical gates are stabilizer code-generic, these implementations enable communication between heterogeneous stabilizer codes. These features collectively open the door to countless possibilities for existing and undiscovered codes as well as their scalable, heterogeneous coexistence.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 6 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Multiaccess Coded Caching with Heterogeneous Retrieval Costs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10394v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The multiaccess coded caching (MACC) system, as formulated by Hachem {\it et al.}, consists of a central server with a library of $N$ files, connected to $K$ cache-less users via an error-free shared link, and $K$ cache nodes, each equipped with cache memory of size $M$ files. Each user can access $L$ neighboring cache nodes under a cyclic wrap-around topology. Most existing studies operate under the strong assumption that users can retrieve content from their connected cache nodes at no communication cost. In practice, each user retrieves content from its $L$ different connected cache nodes at varying costs. Additionally, the server also incurs certain costs to transmit the content to the users. In this paper, we focus on a cost-aware MACC system and aim to minimize the total system cost, which includes cache-access costs and broadcast costs. Firstly, we propose a novel coded caching framework based on superposition coding, where the MACC schemes of Cheng \textit{et al.} are layered. Then, a cost-aware optimization problem is derived that optimizes cache placement and minimizes system cost. By identifying a sparsity property of the optimal solution, we propose a structure-aware algorithm with reduced complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme consistently outperforms the scheme of Cheng {\it et al.} in scenarios with heterogeneous retrieval costs.</p></details> | 9 pages, 3 figures |
| **[OctoBench: Benchmarking Scaffold-Aware Instruction Following in Repository-Grounded Agentic Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10343v2)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern coding scaffolds turn LLMs into capable software agents, but their ability to follow scaffold-specified instructions remains under-examined, especially when constraints are heterogeneous and persist across interactions. To fill this gap, we introduce OctoBench, which benchmarks scaffold-aware instruction following in repository-grounded agentic coding. OctoBench includes 34 environments and 217 tasks instantiated under three scaffold types, and is paired with 7,098 objective checklist items. To disentangle solving the task from following the rules, we provide an automated observation-and-scoring toolkit that captures full trajectories and performs fine-grained checks. Experiments on eight representative models reveal a systematic gap between task-solving and scaffold-aware compliance, underscoring the need for training and evaluation that explicitly targets heterogeneous instruction following. We release the benchmark to support reproducible benchmarking and to accelerate the development of more scaffold-aware coding agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating perturbation robustness of generative systems that use COBOL code inputs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18488v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Systems incorporating large language models (LLMs) as a component are known to be sensitive (i.e., non-robust) to minor input variations that do not change the meaning of the input; such sensitivity may reduce the system's usefulness. Here, we present a framework to evaluate robustness of systems using COBOL code as input; our application is translation between COBOL and Java programming languages, but the approach extends to other tasks such as code generation or explanation. Targeting robustness of systems with COBOL as input is essential yet challenging. Many business-critical applications are written in COBOL, yet these are typically proprietary legacy applications and their code is unavailable to LLMs for training. We develop a library of COBOL paragraph and full-program perturbation methods, and create variant-expanded versions of a benchmark dataset of examples for a specific task. The robustness of the LLM-based system is evaluated by measuring changes in values of individual and aggregate metrics calculated on the system's outputs. Finally, we present a series of dynamic table and chart visualization dashboards that assist in debugging the system's outputs, and monitoring and understanding root causes of the system's sensitivity to input variation. These tools can be further used to improve the system by, for instance, indicating variations that should be handled by pre-processing steps.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages (8 main, 8 appendix).

| **[Efficient LLR-Domain Decoding of ABS+ Polar Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10808v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>ABS+ polar codes are a generalization of Arikan polar codes that provides much faster polarization. We present an LLR-domain implementation of the SCL decoder of ABS+ polar codes. Furthermore, we optimize the SCL algorithm in order to reduce the complexity requirements for the LLRs computation. In comparison with classical polar codes, the proposed approach requires less number of arithmetic operations in the SCL decoder to obtain the fixed frame error rate (FER) at high-SNR region.</p></details> |  |

Guesses are tracked symbolically and can be eliminated by restrictive checks, giving a tunable tradeoff between complexity and performance via a guessing budget: an unconstrained budget recovers Maximum-Likelihood (ML) performance, while a constant budget yields linear-time decoding and approximates ML. We provide theoretical guarantees on asymptotic performance and demonstrate strong performance on bivariate bicycle and quantum Tanner codes.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, submitted to the IEEE ISIT 2026</p></details> |
| **[Improved Constructions of Reed-Solomon Codes with Optimal Repair Bandwidth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10685v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maximum-distance-separable (MDS) codes are widely used in distributed storage, yet naive repair of a single erasure in an $[n,k]$ MDS code downloads the entire contents of $k$ nodes. Minimum Storage Regenerating (MSR) codes (Dimakis et al., 2010) minimize repair bandwidth by contacting $d>k$ helpers and downloading only a fraction of data from each. Guruswami and Wootters first proposed a linear repair scheme for Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, showing that they can be repaired with lower bandwidth than the naive approach. The existence of RS codes achieving the MSR point (RS-MSR codes) nevertheless remained open until the breakthrough construction of Tamo, Barg, and Ye, which yields RS-MSR codes with subpacketization $\ell = s \prod_{i=1}^n p_i$, where $p_i$ are distinct primes satisfying $p_i \equiv 1 \pmod{s}$ and $s=d+1-k$. In this paper, we present an improved construction of RS-MSR codes by eliminating the congruence condition $p_i \equiv 1 \pmod{s}$. Consequently, our construction reduces the subpacketization by a multiplicative factor of $φ(s)^n$ ( $φ(\cdot)$ is Euler's totient function) and broadens the range of feasible parameters for RS-MSR codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Implementation of Oblivious Transfer over Binary-Input AWGN Channels by Polar Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10682v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a one-out-of-two-oblivious transfer protocol over the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise channel using polar codes. The scheme uses two decoder views linked by automorphisms of the polar transform and publicly draws the encoder at random from the corresponding automorphism group. This yields perfect receiver privacy at any finite blocklength, since the public encoder distribution is independent of the receiver's choice bit. Sender privacy is obtained asymptotically via channel polarization combined with privacy amplification. Because the construction deliberately injects randomness on selected bad bit-channels, we derive a relaxed reliability criterion and evaluate finite-blocklength performance. Finally, we characterize the polar-transform automorphisms as bit-level permutations of bit-channel indices, and exploit this structure to derive and optimize an achievable finite-blocklength OT rate.</p></details> | 64 pages, 3 figures |
| **[One-Shot Broadcast Joint Source-Channel Coding with Codebook Diversity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10648v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study a one-shot joint source-channel coding setting where the source is encoded once and broadcast to $K$ decoders through independent channels. Success is predicated on at least one decoder recovering the source within a maximum distortion constraint. We find that in the one-shot regime, utilizing disjoint codebooks at each decoder yields a codebook diversity gain, distinct from the channel diversity gain that may be expected when several decoders observe independent realizations of the channel's output but share the same codebook. Coding schemes are introduced that leverage this phenomenon, where first- and second-order achievability bounds are derived via an adaptation of the Poisson matching lemma (Li and Anantharam, 2021) which allows for multiple decoders using disjoint codebooks. We further propose a hybrid coding scheme that partitions decoders into groups to optimally balance codebook and channel diversity. Numerical results on the binary symmetric channel demonstrate that the hybrid approach outperforms strategies where the decoders' codebooks are either fully shared or disjoint.</p></details> |  |
| **[Basis-Spline Assisted Coded Computing: Strategies and Error Bounds](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10616v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coded computing has become a key framework for reliable distributed computation over decentralized networks, effectively mitigating the impact of stragglers. Although there exists a wide range of coded computing methods to handle both polynomial and non-polynomial functions, computing methods for the latter class have received traction due its inherent challenges in reconstructing non-polynomial functions using a finite number of evaluations. Among them, the state-of-the-art method is Berrut Approximated coded computing, wherein Berrut interpolants, are used for approximating the non-polynomial function. However, since Berrut interpolants have global support characteristics, such methods are known to offer degraded accuracy when the number of stragglers is large. To address this challenge, we propose a coded computing framework based on cubic B-spline interpolation. In our approach, server-side function evaluations are reconstructed at the master node using B-splines, exploiting their local support and smoothness properties to enhance stability and accuracy. We provide a systematic methodology for integrating B-spline interpolation into coded computing and derive theoretical bounds on approximation error in terms of the number of servers and stragglers. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our framework significantly outperforms Berrut-based methods for various non-polynomial functions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Error-Correcting Codes for Two Bursts of t1-Deletion-t2-Insertion with Low Computational Complexity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10540v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Burst errors involving simultaneous insertions, deletions, and substitutions occur in practical scenarios, including DNA data storage and document synchronization, motivating developments of channel codes that can correct such errors. In this paper, we address the problem of constructing error-correcting codes (ECCs) capable of handling multiple bursts of $t_1$-deletion-$t_2$-insertion ($(t_1,t_2)$-DI) errors, where each burst consists of $t_1$ deletions followed by $t_2$ insertions in a binary sequence. We make three key contributions: Firstly, we establish the fundamental equivalence of (1) two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs, (2) two bursts of $(t_2,t_1)$-DI ECCs, and (3) one burst each of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI and $(t_2,t_1)$-DI ECCs. Then, we derive lower and upper bounds on the code size of two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs, which can naturally be extended to the case of multiple bursts. Finally, we present constructions of two bursts of $(t_1,t_2)$-DI ECCs. Compared to the codes obtained by the syndrome compression technique, the resulting codes achieve significantly lower computational complexity.</p></details> |  |

In particular, we study linear compression schemes and show that simple truncation is the best linear scheme in two cases: (1) testing opposite signs of the same magnitude of correlation, and (2) testing for or against independence. We conjecture, supported by numerical evidence, that truncation is the best linear code for testing any correlations of opposite signs. Further, for testing against independence, we also compute classical random coding exponents and show that truncation, and consequently any linear code, is strictly suboptimal.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to ISIT 2026</p></details> |
| **[A New Construction Structure on Multi-access Coded Caching with Linear Subpacketization: Cyclic Multi-Access Non-Half-Sum Disjoint Packing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10510v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the $(K,L,M,N)$ multi-access coded caching system introduced by Hachem et al., which consists of a central server with $N$ files and $K$ cache nodes, each of memory size $M$, where each user can access $L$ cache nodes in a cyclic wrap-around fashion. At present, several existing schemes achieve competitive transmission performance, but their subpacketization levels grow exponentially with the number of users. In contrast, schemes with linear or polynomial subpacketization always incur higher transmission loads. We aim to design a multi-access coded caching scheme with linear subpacketization $F$ while maintaining low transmission load. Recently, Cheng et al. proposed a construction framework for coded caching schemes with linear subpacketization (i.e., $F=K$) called non-half-sum disjoint packing (NHSDP). Inspired by this structure, we introduce a novel combinatorial structure named cyclic multi-access non-half-sum disjoint packing (CMA-NHSDP) by extending NHSDP to MACC system. By constructing CMA-NHSDP, we obtain a new class of multi-access coded caching schemes. Theoretical and numerical analyses show that our scheme achieves lower transmission loads than some existing schemes with linear subpacketization. Moreover, the proposed schemes achieves lower transmission load compared to existing schemes with exponential subpacketization in some case.</p></details> |  |
| **[LogicLens: Leveraging Semantic Code Graph to explore Multi Repository large systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10773v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding large software systems is a challenging task, especially when code is distributed across multiple repositories and microservices. Developers often need to reason not only about the structure of the code, but also about its domain logic and runtime behaviors, which are typically implicit and scattered. We introduce LogicLens, a reactive conversational agent that assists developers in exploring complex software systems through a semantic multi-repository graph. This graph is built in a preprocessing step by combining syntactic code analysis, via AST parsing and repository traversal, with semantic enrichment using Large Language Models (LLMs). The resulting graph captures both structural elements, such as files, classes, and functions, as well as functional abstractions like domain entities, operations, and workflows. Once the graph is constructed, LogicLens enables developers to interact with it via natural language, dynamically retrieving relevant subgraphs and answering technical or functional queries. We present the architecture of the system, discuss emergent behaviors, and evaluate its effectiveness on real-world multi-repository scenarios. We demonstrate emergent capabilities including impact analysis and symptom-based debugging that arise naturally from the semantic graph structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[A New Construction Structure on Coded Caching with Linear Subpacketization: Non-Half-Sum Latin Rectangle](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10505v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coded caching is recognized as an effective method for alleviating network congestion during peak periods by leveraging local caching and coded multicasting gains. The key challenge in designing coded caching schemes lies in simultaneously achieving low subpacketization and low transmission load. Most existing schemes require exponential or polynomial subpacketization levels, while some linear subpacketization schemes often result in excessive transmission load. Recently, Cheng et al. proposed a construction framework for linear coded caching schemes called Non-Half-Sum Disjoint Packing (NHSDP), where the subpacketization equals the number of users $K$. This paper introduces a novel combinatorial structure, termed the Non-Half-Sum Latin Rectangle (NHSLR), which extends the framework of linear coded caching schemes from $F=K$ (i.e., the construction via NHSDP) to a broader scenario with $F=\mathcal{O}(K)$. By constructing NHSLR, we have obtained a new class of coded caching schemes that achieves linearly scalable subpacketization, while further reducing the transmission load compared with the NHSDP scheme. Theoretical and numerical analyses demonstrate that the proposed schemes not only achieves lower transmission load than existing linear subpacketization schemes but also approaches the performance of certain exponential subpacketization schemes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coded Caching for Combinatorial Multi-Access Hotplug Networks from $t$-Designs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10503v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study hotplug coded caching in combinatorial multi-access networks, which generalizes existing hotplug coded caching models by allowing users to access multiple caches, while only a subset of caches is online during the delivery phase. We first generalize the Hotplug Placement Delivery Array (HpPDA) framework to the combinatorial multi-access setting. Based on this generalized framework, we propose a t-design-based coded caching scheme for combinatorial multi-access networks. We characterize a class of design parameters under which every active user has access to a sufficient number of coded subfiles to decode its requested file, and show that appropriate parameter choices allow for the elimination of redundant multicast transmissions. As a result, the proposed scheme achieves a family of rate memory trade offs with flexible subpacketization. We present numerical comparisons illustrating that the proposed t-scheme outperforms existing hotplug coded caching schemes in certain memory regimes.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages and 1 figure</p></details> |

Exposure-Aware Evaluation of Bug-vs-Fix Preference in Code LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10496v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models are increasingly used for code generation and debugging, but their outputs can still contain bugs, that originate from training data. Distinguishing whether an LLM prefers correct code, or a familiar incorrect version might be influenced by what it's been exposed to during training. We introduce an exposure-aware evaluation framework that quantifies how prior exposure to buggy versus fixed code influences a model's preference. Using the ManySStuBs4J benchmark, we apply Data Portraits for membership testing on the Stack-V2 corpus to estimate whether each buggy and fixed variant was seen during training. We then stratify examples by exposure and compare model preference using code completion as well as multiple likelihood-based scoring metrics We find that most examples (67%) have neither variant in the training data, and when only one is present, fixes are more frequently present than bugs. In model generations, models reproduce buggy lines far more often than fixes, with bug-exposed examples amplifying this tendency and fix-exposed examples showing only marginal improvement. In likelihood scoring, minimum and maximum token-probability metrics consistently prefer the fixed code across all conditions, indicating a stable bias toward correct fixes. In contrast, metrics like the Gini coefficient reverse preference when only the buggy variant was seen. Our results indicate that exposure can skew bug-fix evaluations and highlight the risk that LLMs may propagate memorised errors in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>MSR 2...</summary><p>MSR 2026 Technical Track</p></details> |

A core objective in this field is characterizing the performance tradeoff between sensing and communication. In this paper, we consider a joint source-channel coding (JSCC) framework for the ISAC system that consists of a transmitter with a channel state estimator and a joint source-channel encoder, a state-dependent memoryless channel, and a receiver with a joint source-channel decoder. From an information-theoretic perspective, we establish the tradeoff relationships among channel capacity, distortions in both communication and sensing processes, and the estimation cost. We prove that the separate source and channel coding can achieve joint optimality in this setting. An illustrative example of a binary setting is also provided to validate our theoretical results.</p></details> |  |

The evaluation follows the same test methodology and conditions previously defined for MPEG multilayer video coding assessments, with the LCEVC enhancement layer encoded using version 8.1 of the LCEVC Test Model (LTM). The test compares reconstructed UHD output generated from an HD VVC base layer with LCEVC enhancement against two reference cases: upsampled VVC base layer decoding and multilayer VVC (ML-VVC). Two operating points are considered, corresponding to enhancement layers representing approximately 10% and 50% of the total bitrate. Subjective assessment was conducted using the Degradation Category Rating (DCR) methodology with twenty five participants, across a dataset comprising fifteen SDR and HDR sequences. The reported results include Mean Opinion Scores (MOS) with associated 95% confidence intervals, enabling comparison of perceptual quality across coding approaches and operating points within the defined test scope.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hybrid Reliability--Weight Framework for Construction of Polar Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10376v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Polar codes are usually constructed by ranking synthetic bit-channels according to reliability, which guarantees capacity-achieving behavior but can yield poor low-weight spectra at short and moderate lengths. Recent algebraic results express the contribution of individual bit-channels to the multiplicities of minimum and near-minimum weight codewords in closed form. In this work we combine these insights into a mixed (reliability--weight) bit-channel ordering. We define a per-bit cost whose distance term is derived from orbit enumeration of minimum-weight codewords and scaled by a Bhattacharyya-type factor, and show that the resulting mixed construction minimises a truncated SC/ML union-bound surrogate within a class of decreasing monomial codes. We relate the mixed metric to error events in SCL decoding via a pruning/ML decomposition, and prove that mixed designs act as local perturbations of reliability-based constructions whose asymptotic impact vanishes as code-length approaches infinity. Numerical results for short and moderate lengths on BPSK-AWGN, implemented via Gaussian approximation and closed-form weight contributions, illustrate the trade-off between pure reliability-based and mixed constructions in terms of minimum distance, multiplicity, and union-bound approximations. All proofs are deferred to the appendices.</p></details> | 7 pages |

We develop a general framework to compute the Hamming weight of codewords generated by sums of monomials, express these weights in a canonical dyadic form, and derive closed expressions for key structural templates (disjoint sums, nested blocks, complementary flips) that generate the low and intermediate weight spectrum. Combining these templates with the LTA group action, we obtain explicit multiplicity formulas, yielding a unified algebraic method to characterize and enumerate codewords.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[A New Construction Structure on MISO Coded Caching with Linear Subpacketization: Half-Sum Disjoint Packing](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10353v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the $(L,K,M,N)$ cache-aided multiple-input single-output (MISO) broadcast channel (BC) system, the server is equipped with $L$ antennas and communicates with $K$ single-antenna users through a wireless broadcast channel where the server has a library containing $N$ files, and each user is equipped with a cache of size $M$ files. Under the constraints of uncoded placement and one-shot linear delivery strategies, many schemes achieve the maximum sum Degree-of-Freedom (sum-DoF). However, for general parameters $L$, $M$, and $N$, their subpacketizations increase exponentially with the number of users. We aim to design a MISO coded caching scheme that achieves a large sum-DoF with low subpacketization $F$. An interesting combinatorial structure, called the multiple-antenna placement delivery array (MAPDA), can be used to generate MISO coded caching schemes under these two strategies; moreover, all existing schemes with these strategies can be represented by the corresponding MAPDAs. In this paper, we study the case with $F=K$ (i.e., $F$ grows linearly with $K$) by investigating MAPDAs. Specifically, based on the framework of Latin squares, we transform the design of MAPDA with $F=K$ into the construction of a combinatorial structure called the $L$-half-sum disjoint packing (HSDP). It is worth noting that a $1$-HSDP is exactly the concept of NHSDP, which is used to generate the shared-link coded caching scheme with $F=K$. By constructing $L$-HSDPs, we obtain a class of new schemes with $F=K$. Finally, theoretical and numerical analyses show that our $L$-HSDP schemes significantly reduce subpacketization compared to existing schemes with exponential subpacketization, while only slightly sacrificing sum-DoF, and achieve both a higher sum-DoF and lower subpacketization than the existing schemes with linear subpacketization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Convertible Codes for Data and Device Heterogeneity](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10341v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed storage systems must handle both data heterogeneity, arising from non-uniform access demands, and device heterogeneity, caused by time-varying node reliability. In this paper, we study convertible codes, which enable the transformation of one code into another with minimum cost in the merge regime, addressing the latter. We derive general lower bounds on the read and write costs of linear code conversion, applicable to arbitrary linear codes. We then focus on Reed-Muller codes, which efficiently handle data heterogeneity, addressing the former issue, and construct explicit conversion procedures that, for the first time, combine both forms of heterogeneity for distributed data storage.</p></details> |  |
| **[In-Context Source and Channel Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10267v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Separate Source-Channel Coding (SSCC) remains attractive for text transmission due to its modularity and compatibility with mature entropy coders and powerful channel codes. However, SSCC often suffers from a pronounced cliff effect in low Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) regimes, where residual bit errors after channel decoding can catastrophically break lossless source decoding, especially for Arithmetic Coding (AC) driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). This paper proposes a receiver-side In-Context Decoding (ICD) framework that enhances SSCC robustness without modifying the transmitter. ICD leverages an Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT) to obtain bit-wise reliability for the decoded information bits. Based on the context-consistent bitstream, ICD constructs a confidence-ranked candidate pool via reliability-guided bit flipping, samples a compact yet diverse subset of candidates, and applies an LLM-based arithmetic decoder to obtain both reconstructions and sequence-level log-likelihoods. A reliability-likelihood fusion rule then selects the final output. We further provide theoretical guarantees on the stability and convergence of the proposed sampling procedure. Extensive experiments over Additive White Gaussian Noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels demonstrate consistent gains compared with conventional SSCC baselines and representative Joint Source-Channel Coding (JSCC) schemes.</p></details> |  |

| **[XuanJia: A Comprehensive Virtualization-Based Code Obfuscator for Binary Protection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10261v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Virtualization-based binary obfuscation is widely adopted to protect software intellectual property, yet existing approaches leave exception-handling (EH) metadata unprotected to preserve ABI compatibility. This exposed metadata leaks rich structural information, such as stack layouts, control-flow boundaries, and object lifetimes, which can be exploited to facilitate reverse engineering. In this paper, we present XuanJia, a comprehensive VM-based binary obfuscation framework that provides end-to-end protection for both executable code and exception-handling semantics. At the core of XuanJia is ABI-Compliant EH Shadowing, a novel exception-aware protection mechanism that preserves compatibility with unmodified operating system runtimes while eliminating static EH metadata leakage. XuanJia replaces native EH metadata with ABI-compliant shadow unwind information to satisfy OS-driven unwinding, and securely redirects exception handling into a protected virtual machine where the genuine EH semantics are decrypted, reversed, and replayed using obfuscated code. We implement XuanJia from scratch, supporting 385 x86 instruction encodings and 155 VM handler templates, and design it as an extensible research testbed. We evaluate XuanJia across correctness, resilience, and performance dimensions. Our results show that XuanJia preserves semantic equivalence under extensive dynamic and symbolic testing, effectively disrupts automated reverse-engineering tools such as IDA Pro, and incurs negligible space overhead and modest runtime overhead. These results demonstrate that XuanJia achieves strong protection of exception-handling logic without sacrificing correctness or practicality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Error-Correcting Codes for the Sum Channel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10256v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce the sum channel, a new channel model motivated by applications in distributed storage and DNA data storage. In the error-free case, it takes as input an $\ell$-row binary matrix and outputs an $(\ell+1)$-row matrix whose first $\ell$ rows equal the input and whose last row is their parity (sum) row. We construct a two-deletion-correcting code with redundancy $2\lceil\log_2\log_2 n\rceil + O(\ell^2)$ for $\ell$-row inputs. When $\ell=2$, we establish an upper bound of $\lceil\log_2\log_2 n\rceil + O(1)$, implying that our redundancy is optimal up to a factor of 2. We also present a code correcting a single substitution with $\lceil \log_2(\ell+1)\rceil$ redundant bits and prove that it is within one bit of optimality.</p></details> | Full version |
| **[Sharpen the Spec, Cut the Code: A Case for Generative File System with SYSSPEC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13047v3)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>File systems are critical OS components that require constant evolution to support new hardware and emerging application needs. However, the traditional paradigm of developing features, fixing bugs, and maintaining the system incurs significant overhead, especially as systems grow in complexity. This paper proposes a new paradigm, generative file systems, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and evolve a file system from prompts, effectively addressing the need for robust evolution. Despite the widespread success of LLMs in code generation, attempts to create a functional file system have thus far been unsuccessful, mainly due to the ambiguity of natural language prompts. This paper introduces SYSSPEC, a framework for developing generative file systems. Its key insight is to replace ambiguous natural language with principles adapted from formal methods. Instead of imprecise prompts, SYSSPEC employs a multi-part specification that accurately describes a file system's functionality, modularity, and concurrency. The specification acts as an unambiguous blueprint, guiding LLMs to generate expected code flexibly. To manage evolution, we develop a DAG-structured patch that operates on the specification itself, enabling new features to be added without violating existing invariants. Moreover, the SYSSPEC toolchain features a set of LLM-based agents with mechanisms to mitigate hallucination during construction and evolution. We demonstrate our approach by generating SPECFS, a concurrent file system. SPECFS demonstrates equivalent level of correctness to that of a manually-coded baseline across hundreds of regression tests. We further confirm its evolvability by seamlessly integrating 10 real-world features from Ext4. Our work shows that a specification-guided approach makes generating and evolving complex systems not only feasible but also highly effective.</p></details> |  |

A major challenge in respect of the code construction is how to obtain such codes with the shortest possible length (or equivalently, the smallest possible circulant size) using algebraic methods instead of search methods. The greatest-common-divisor (GCD) framework we previously proposed has algebraically constructed QC-LDPC codes with column weights of 5 and 6, very short lengths, and a girth of 8. By introducing the concept of a mirror sequence and adopting a new row-regrouping scheme, QC-LDPC codes with column weights of 7 and 8, very short lengths, and a girth of 8 are proposed for arbitrary row weights in this article via an algebraic manner under the GCD framework. Thanks to these novel algebraic methods, the lower bounds (for column weights 7 and 8) on consecutive circulant sizes are both improved by asymptotically about 20%, compared with the existing benchmarks. Furthermore, these new constructions can also offer circulant sizes asymptotically about 25% smaller than the novel bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures; Submitted to ISIT2026 (preprint)</p></details> |

Recent efforts such as InfiBench and StackEval rely on Stack Overflow questions and remain limited to single-turn interactions, manually curated data, and isolated snippets rather than full project environments. We introduce CodeAssistBench (CAB), the first benchmark for evaluating multi-turn, project-grounded programming assistance at scale. CAB automatically constructs datasets from GitHub issues tagged as questions, using an LLM-driven pipeline that filters noise, extracts runnable contexts, builds executable containers, and verifies environment correctness. This enables continuous, automated expansion across diverse repositories without manual intervention. Using CAB, we create a testbed of 3,286 real-world issues across 214 repositories, spanning seven languages. Evaluating state-of-the-art models reveals a substantial gap: while models achieve 70-83% accuracy on Stack Overflow-style questions, they solve only 7.22-16.49% of CAB issues from post-training-cutoff repositories. These results highlight a fundamental challenge: current LLMs struggle to provide assistance in realistic, project-specific contexts despite strong performance on traditional Q&A benchmarks. CAB provides a scalable, reproducible framework for advancing research in multi-turn, codebase-grounded programming agents. The benchmark and pipeline are fully automated and publicly available at https://github.com/amazon-science/CodeAssistBench/.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 Datasets and Benchmarks Track</p></details> |

In this work, we study optimal single-error correcting FCCs (SEFCCs) for maximally-unbalanced Boolean functions, where $k$ denotes the message length and $t$ denotes the error-correction capability. We analyze the structure of optimal SEFCC constructions through their associated codeword distance matrices and identify distinct FCC classes based on this structure. We then examine the impact of these structural differences on error performance by evaluating representative FCCs over the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel using both soft-decision and hard-decision decoding. The results show that FCCs with different distance-matrix structures can exhibit markedly different Data BER and function error behavior, and that the influence of code structure depends strongly on the decoding strategy.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures and 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Repository Intelligence Graph: Deterministic Architectural Map for LLM Code Assistants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10112v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repository aware coding agents often struggle to recover build and test structure, especially in multilingual projects where cross language dependencies are encoded across heterogeneous build systems and tooling. We introduce the Repository Intelligence Graph (RIG), a deterministic, evidence backed architectural map that represents buildable components, aggregators, runners, tests, external packages, and package managers, connected by explicit dependency and coverage edges that trace back to concrete build and test definitions. We also present SPADE, a deterministic extractor that constructs RIG from build and test artifacts (currently with an automatic CMake plugin based on the CMake File API and CTest metadata), and exposes RIG as an LLM friendly JSON view that agents can treat as the authoritative description of repository structure. We evaluate three commercial agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex) on eight repositories spanning low to high build oriented complexity, including the real world MetaFFI project. Each agent answers thirty structured questions per repository with and without RIG in context, and we measure accuracy, wall clock completion time, and efficiency (seconds per correct answer). Across repositories and agents, providing RIG improves mean accuracy by 12.2\% and reduces completion time by 53.9\%, yielding a mean 57.8\% reduction in seconds per correct answer. Gains are larger in multilingual repositories, which improve by 17.7\% in accuracy and 69.5\% in efficiency on average, compared to 6.6\% and 46.1\% in single language repositories. Qualitative analysis suggests that RIG shifts failures from structural misunderstandings toward reasoning mistakes over a correct structure, while rare regressions highlight that graph based reasoning quality remains a key factor.</p></details> | 35 pages, 5 figures |

| **[Controlled Self-Evolution for Algorithmic Code Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07348v4)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-evolution methods enhance code generation through iterative "generate-verify-refine" cycles, yet existing approaches suffer from low exploration efficiency, failing to discover solutions with superior complexity within limited budgets. This inefficiency stems from initialization bias trapping evolution in poor solution regions, uncontrolled stochastic operations lacking feedback guidance, and insufficient experience utilization across tasks. To address these bottlenecks, we propose Controlled Self-Evolution (CSE), which consists of three key components. Diversified Planning Initialization generates structurally distinct algorithmic strategies for broad solution space coverage. Genetic Evolution replaces stochastic operations with feedback-guided mechanisms, enabling targeted mutation and compositional crossover. Hierarchical Evolution Memory captures both successful and failed experiences at inter-task and intra-task levels. Experiments on EffiBench-X demonstrate that CSE consistently outperforms all baselines across various LLM backbones. Furthermore, CSE achieves higher efficiency from early generations and maintains continuous improvement throughout evolution.

In a seminal work, Ben-Sasson \textit{et al.}\ showed that the collection of affine subspaces exhibits a $(δ,\varepsilon)$-proximity gap with respect to the property of being Reed--Solomon (RS) codewords with $δ$ up to the so-called Johnson bound for list decoding. Their technique relies on the Guruswami--Sudan list decoding algorithm for RS codes, which is guaranteed to work in the Johnson bound regime. Folded Reed--Solomon (FRS) codes are known to achieve the optimal list decoding radius $δ$, a regime known as capacity. Moreover, a rich line of list decoding algorithms was developed for FRS codes. It is then natural to ask if FRS codes can be shown to exhibit an analogous $(δ,\varepsilon)$-proximity gap, but up to the so-called optimal capacity regime. We answer this question in the affirmative (and the framework naturally applies more generally to suitable subspace-design codes). An additional motivation to understand proximity gaps for FRS codes is the recent results [BCDZ'25] showing that they exhibit properties similar to random linear codes, which were previously shown to be related to properties of RS codes with random evaluation points in [LMS'25], as well as codes over constant-size alphabet based on AEL [JS'25].</p></details> |  |
| **[Fundamental Limits of Coded Polynomial Aggregation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10028v1)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coded polynomial aggregation (CPA) enables the master to directly recover a weighted aggregation of polynomial evaluations without individually decoding each term, thereby reducing the number of required worker responses. In this paper, we extend CPA to straggler-aware distributed computing systems and introduce a straggler-aware CPA framework with pre-specified non-straggler patterns, where exact recovery is required only for a given collection of admissible non-straggler sets. Our main result shows that exact recovery of the desired aggregation is achievable with fewer worker responses than required by polynomial coded computing based on individual decoding, and that feasibility is fundamentally characterized by the intersection structure of the non-straggler patterns. In particular, we establish necessary and sufficient conditions for exact recovery in straggler-aware CPA and identify an intersection-size threshold that is sufficient to guarantee exact recovery. We further prove that this threshold becomes both necessary and sufficient when the number of admissible non-straggler sets is sufficiently large. We also provide an explicit construction of feasible CPA schemes whenever the intersection size exceeds the derived threshold. Finally, simulations reveal a sharp feasibility transition at the predicted threshold, providing empirical evidence that the bound is tight in practice.</p></details> | 7 pages, 1 figure |

In this work, we study the problem of efficient reconstruction when each of the $K$ outputs is corrupted by a $q$-ary discrete memoryless symmetric (DMS) substitution channel with substitution probability $p$. Focusing on Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, we adapt the Koetter-Vardy soft-decision decoding algorithm to obtain an efficient reconstruction algorithm. For sufficiently large blocklength and alphabet size, we derive an explicit rate threshold, depending only on $(p, K)$, such that the transmitted codeword can be reconstructed with arbitrarily small probability of error whenever the code rate $R$ lies below this threshold.</p></details> |  |

We present a simple, generalizable two-stage workflow: an LLM applies a human-designed, LLM-adapted codebook; a secondary LLM critic performs self-reflection on each positive label by re-reading the source text alongside the first model's rationale and issuing a final decision. We evaluate this approach on six qualitative codes over 3,000 high-content emails from Apache Software Foundation project evaluation discussions. Our human-derived audit of 360 positive annotations (60 passages by six codes) found that the first-line LLM had a false-positive rate of 8% to 54%, despite F1 scores of 0.74 and 1.00 in testing. Subsequent recoding of all stage-one annotations via a second self-reflection stage improved F1 by 0.04 to 0.25, bringing two especially poor performing codes up to 0.69 and 0.79 from 0.52 and 0.55 respectively. Our manual evaluation identified two recurrent error classes: misinterpretation (violations of code definitions) and meta-discussion (debate about a project evaluation criterion mistaken for its use as a decision justification). Code-specific critic clauses addressing observed failure modes were especially effective with testing and refinement, replicating the codebook-adaption process for LLM interpretation in stage-one. We explain how favoring recall in first-line LLM annotation combined with secondary critique delivers precision-first, compute-light control. With human guidance and validation, self-reflection slots into existing LLM-assisted annotation pipelines to reduce noise and potentially salvage unusable classifiers.</p></details> |  |
| **[PrivCode: When Code Generation Meets Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05459v3)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have presented outstanding performance in code generation and completion. However, fine-tuning these models on private datasets can raise privacy and proprietary concerns, such as the leakage of sensitive personal information. Differentially private (DP) code generation provides theoretical guarantees for protecting sensitive code by generating synthetic datasets that preserve statistical properties while reducing privacy leakage concerns. However, DP code generation faces significant challenges due to the strict syntactic dependencies and the privacy-utility trade-off. We propose PrivCode, the first DP synthesizer specifically designed for code datasets. It incorporates a two-stage framework to improve both privacy and utility. In the first stage, termed "privacy-sanitizing", PrivCode generates DP-compliant synthetic code by training models using DP-SGD while introducing syntactic information to preserve code structure. The second stage, termed "utility-boosting", fine-tunes a larger pre-trained LLM on the synthetic privacy-free code to mitigate the utility loss caused by DP, enhancing the utility of the generated code. Extensive experiments on four LLMs show that PrivCode generates higher-utility code across various testing tasks under four benchmarks. The experiments also confirm its ability to protect sensitive data under varying privacy budgets.

| **[Beyond Strict Rules: Assessing the Effectiveness of Large Language Models for Code Smell Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09873v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code smells are symptoms of potential code quality problems that may affect software maintainability, thus increasing development costs and impacting software reliability. Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities for supporting various software engineering activities, but their use for detecting code smells remains underexplored. However, unlike the rigid rules of static analysis tools, LLMs can support flexible and adaptable detection strategies tailored to the unique properties of code smells. This paper evaluates the effectiveness of four LLMs -- DeepSeek-R1, GPT-5 mini, Llama-3.3, and Qwen2.5-Code -- for detecting nine code smells across 30 Java projects. For the empirical evaluation, we created a ground-truth dataset by asking 76 developers to manually inspect 268 code-smell candidates. Our results indicate that LLMs perform strongly for structurally straightforward smells, such as Large Class and Long Method. However, we also observed that different LLMs and tools fare better for distinct code smells. We then propose and evaluate a detection strategy that combines LLMs and static analysis tools. The proposed strategy outperforms LLMs and tools in five out of nine code smells in terms of F1-Score. However, it also generates more false positives for complex smells. Therefore, we conclude that the optimal strategy depends on whether Recall or Precision is the main priority for code smell detection.</p></details> |  |

Adhering to these conventions improves maintainability, understandability, and extensibility. Additionally, following best practices during software development enhances performance and reduces the likelihood of errors. This paper analyzes 1,036 popular open-source JAVA projects on GITHUB to study how code style and programming practices are adopted and evolve over time, examining their prevalence and the most common violations. Additionally, we study a subset of active repositories on a monthly basis to track changes in adherence to coding standards over time. We found widespread violations across repositories, with Javadoc and Naming violations being the most common. We also found a significant number of violations of the GOOGLE Java Style Guide in categories often missed by modern static analysis tools. Furthermore, repositories claiming to follow code-style practices exhibited slightly higher overall adherence to code-style and best-practices. The results provide valuable insights into the adoption of code style and programming practices, highlighting key areas for improvement in the open-source development community. Furthermore, the paper identifies important lessons learned and suggests future directions for improving code quality in JAVA projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME 2025).

The emergence of large language models (LLMs) has significantly advanced code generation, though their efficiency is still impacted by certain inherent architectural constraints. Each token generation necessitates a complete inference pass, requiring persistent retention of contextual information in memory and escalating resource consumption. While existing research prioritizes inference-phase optimizations such as prompt compression and model quantization, the generation phase remains underexplored. To tackle these challenges, we propose a knowledge-infused framework named ShortCoder, which optimizes code generation efficiency while preserving semantic equivalence and readability. In particular, we introduce: (1) ten syntax-level simplification rules for Python, derived from AST-preserving transformations, achieving 18.1% token reduction without functional compromise; (2) a hybrid data synthesis pipeline integrating rule-based rewriting with LLM-guided refinement, producing ShorterCodeBench, a corpus of validated tuples of original code and simplified code with semantic consistency; (3) a fine-tuning strategy that injects conciseness awareness into the base LLMs. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that ShortCoder consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods on HumanEval, achieving an improvement of 18.1%-37.8% in generation efficiency over previous methods while ensuring the performance of code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Breaking the Orthogonality Barrier in Quantum LDPC Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08824v2)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are a widely deployed and well-established technology, forming the backbone of modern communication and storage systems. It is well known that, in this classical setting, increasing the girth of the Tanner graph while maintaining regular degree distributions leads simultaneously to good belief-propagation (BP) decoding performance and large minimum distance. In the quantum setting, however, this principle does not directly apply because quantum LDPC codes must satisfy additional orthogonality constraints between their parity-check matrices. When one enforces both orthogonality and regularity in a straightforward manner, the girth is typically reduced and the minimum distance becomes structurally upper bounded. In this work, we overcome this limitation by using permutation matrices with controlled commutativity and by restricting the orthogonality constraints to only the necessary parts of the construction, while preserving regular check-matrix structures. This design breaks the conventional trade-off between orthogonality, regularity, girth, and minimum distance, allowing us to construct quantum LDPC codes with large girth and without the usual distance upper bounds. As a concrete demonstration, we construct a girth-8, (3,12)-regular $[[9216,4612, \leq 48]]$ quantum LDPC code and show that, under BP decoding combined with a low-complexity post-processing algorithm, it achieves a frame error rate as low as $10^{-8}$ on the depolarizing channel with error probability $4 \%$.</p></details> | <details><summary>I hav...</summary><p>I have corrected a typo in the matrix in Section 6.1</p></details> |

Our work is a significant generalization of a recent result of Rameshwar and Lalitha (2025) that showed that the RPA decoder provably achieves vanishing error probabilities for "low-rate" RM codes, over the binary symmetric channel (BSC). While a straightforward generalization of the proof strategy in that paper will require additional, restrictive assumptions on the BMS channel, our technique, which employs an equivalence between the RPA projection operation and a part of the "channel combining" phase in polar codes, requires no such assumptions. Interestingly, such an equivalence allows for the use of a generic union bound on the error probability of the first-order RM code (the "base case" of the RPA decoder), under maximum-likelihood decoding, which holds for any BMS channel. We then exploit these observations in the proof strategy outlined in the work of Rameshwar and Lalitha (2025), and argue that, much like in the case of the BSC, one can obtain vanishing error probabilities, in the large $n$ limit (where $n$ is the blocklength), for RM orders that scale roughly as $\log \log n$, for all BMS channels.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, to be submitted to the IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |

However, standard accuracy metrics obscure the underlying reasoning of generative models, offering little insight into how decisions are made. Although post-hoc interpretability methods attempt to fill this gap, they often restrict explanations to local, token-level insights, which fail to provide a developer-understandable global analysis. Our work highlights the urgent need for \textbf{global, code-based} explanations that reveal how models reason across code. To support this vision, we introduce \textit{code rationales} (CodeQ), a framework that enables global interpretability by mapping token-level rationales to high-level programming categories. Aggregating thousands of these token-level explanations allows us to perform statistical analyses that expose systemic reasoning behaviors. We validate this aggregation by showing it distills a clear signal from noisy token data, reducing explanation uncertainty (Shannon entropy) by over 50%. Additionally, we find that a code generation model (\textit{codeparrot-small}) consistently favors shallow syntactic cues (e.g., \textbf{indentation}) over deeper semantic logic. Furthermore, in a user study with 37 participants, we find its reasoning is significantly misaligned with that of human developers. These findings, hidden from traditional metrics, demonstrate the importance of global interpretability techniques to foster trust in LM4Code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSE 2026</p></details> |

In this paper we propose fast maximum-likelihood (ML) and max-log-MAP decoders for first-order BiD codes. For second-order codes, we identify their minimum-weight parity checks and ascertain a code property known as 'projection' in the RM coding literature. We use these results to design a belief propagation decoder that performs within 1 dB of ML decoder for block lengths 81 and 243.</p></details> | 11 pages, 4 figures |

| **[Regenerating codes with minimal disk I/O cost achieving optimal tradeoff between storage and repair bandwidth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09300v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are multiple performance metrics in the design of coding schemes for distributed storage systems. The first metric is called repair bandwidth, which measures the network resources required during the repair process. Another critical metric for repair efficiency is disk I/O cost, defined as the amount of data packets accessed at helper nodes to repair the failed node. In an encoding scheme with optimal I/O cost, the number of packets sent to the newcomer is exactly the same as the number of packets read from memory. This mode of repair is referred to as uncoded repair, as no coding operations are performed at the helper node. In addition to minimizing disk I/O cost, an uncoded repair mechanism has the advantage of incurring minimal computational overhead at the helper node. In this paper, we demonstrate that for single node failures, if all surviving nodes participate in the repair of the failed node, we can achieve all points on the fundamental tradeoff curve between storage and repair bandwidth. The design of the proposed encoding scheme is based on the theory of gammoids, a specialized class of graph-based matroids. We prove that this scheme can tolerate an unlimited number of node repair iterations over a field of fixed size.</p></details> |  |

Prior work on Indirect Prompt Injection (IPI) is mainly query-specific, requiring particular user queries as triggers and leading to poor generalizability. We propose query-agnostic IPI, a new attack paradigm that reliably executes malicious payloads under arbitrary user queries. Our key insight is that malicious payloads should leverage the invariant prompt context (i.e., system prompt and tool descriptions) rather than variant user queries. We present QueryIPI, an automated framework that uses tool descriptions as optimizable payloads and refines them via iterative, prompt-based blackbox optimization. QueryIPI leverages system invariants for initial seed generation aligned with agent conventions, and iterative reflection to resolve instruction-following failures and safety refusals. Experiments on five simulated agents show that QueryIPI achieves up to 87% success rate, outperforming the best baseline (50%). Crucially, generated malicious descriptions transfer to real-world coding agents, highlighting a practical security risk.</p></details> |  |

Although it is well known that feedback does not improve the capacity of memoryless channels, we show that the finite length performance of polar codes can be significantly improved as feedback enables genie-aided decoding and allows more flexible thresholds for the polar coding construction. To analyze the performance under the new construction, we then propose an accurate characterization of the distribution of the error event under the genie-aided successive cancellation (SC) decoding. This characterization can be also used to predict the performance of the standard SC decoding of polar codes with rates close to capacity.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 7 figures and 2 tables; A short version will be submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Reducing The Sub-packetization Level of Optimal-Access Cooperative MSR Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09188v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Cooperative MSR codes are a kind of storage codes which enable optimal-bandwidth repair of any $h\geq2$ node erasures in a cooperative way, while retaining the minimum storage as an $[n,k]$ MDS code. Each code coordinate (node) is assumed to store an array of $\ell$ symbols, where $\ell$ is termed as sub-packetization. Large sub-packetization tends to induce high complexity, large input/output in practice. To address the disk IO capability, a cooperative MSR code is said to have optimal-access property, if during node repair, the amount of data accessed at each helper node meets a theoretical lower bound. In this paper, we focus on reducing the sub-packetization of optimal-access cooperative MSR codes with two erasures. At first, we design two crucial MDS array codes for repairing a specific repair pattern of two erasures with optimal access. Then, using the two codes as building blocks and by stacking up of the two codes for several times, we obtain an optimal-access cooperative MSR code with two erasures. The derived code has sub-packetization $\ell=r^{\binom{n}{2}-\lfloor\frac{n}{r}\rfloor(\binom{r}{2}-1)}$ where $r=n-k$, and it reduces $\ell$ by a fraction of $1/r^{\lfloor\frac{n}{r}\rfloor(\binom{r}{2}-1)}$ compared with the state of the art ($\ell=r^{\binom{n}{2}}$).</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Learning-based Binary Analysis for Vulnerability Detection in x86-64 Machine Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09157v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While much of the current research in deep learning-based vulnerability detection relies on disassembled binaries, this paper explores the feasibility of extracting features directly from raw x86-64 machine code. Although assembly language is more interpretable for humans, it requires more complex models to capture token-level context. In contrast, machine code may enable more efficient, lightweight models and preserve all information that might be lost in disassembly. This paper approaches the task of vulnerability detection through an exploratory study on two specific deep learning model architectures and aims to systematically evaluate their performance across three vulnerability types. The results demonstrate that graph-based models consistently outperform sequential models, emphasizing the importance of control flow relationships, and that machine code contains sufficient information for effective vulnerability discovery.</p></details> |  |

Decades of work has helped harden C code against attackers, but C projects do not consist of only C code. C projects also contain build system code for automating development tasks like compilation, testing, and packaging. These build systems are critcal to software supply chain security and vulnerable to being poisoned, with the XZ Utils and SolarWinds attacks being recent examples. Existing techniques try to harden software supply chains by verifying software dependencies, but such methods ignore the build system itself. Similarly, classic software security checkers only analyze and monitor program code, not build system code. Moreover, poisoned build systems can easily circumvent tools for detecting program code vulnerabilities by disabling such checks. We present development phase isolation, a novel strategy for hardening build systems against poisoning by modeling the information and behavior permissions of build automation as if it were program code. We have prototyped this approach as a tool called Foreman, which successfully detects and warns about the poisoned test files involved in the XZ Utils attack. We outline our future plans to protect against pipeline poisoning by automatically checking development phase isolation. We envision a future where build system security checkers are as prevalent as program code checkers.</p></details> | <details><summary>2026 ...</summary><p>2026 IEEE/ACM 48th International Conference on Software Engineering.

| **[Game of Coding: Sybil Resistant Decentralized Machine Learning with Minimal Trust Assumption](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.05540v3)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coding theory plays a crucial role in ensuring data integrity and reliability across various domains, from communication to computation and storage systems. However, its reliance on trust assumptions for data recovery, which requires the number of honest nodes to exceed adversarial nodes by a certain margin, poses significant challenges, particularly in emerging decentralized systems where trust is a scarce resource. To address this, the game of coding framework was introduced, offering insights into strategies for data recovery within incentive-oriented environments. In such environments, participant nodes are rewarded as long as the system remains functional (live). This incentivizes adversaries to maximize their rewards (utility) by ensuring that the decoder, as the data collector (DC), successfully recovers the data, preferably with a high estimation error. This rational behavior is leveraged in a game-theoretic framework, where the equilibrium leads to a robust and resilient system, referred to as the game of coding. The focus of the earliest version of the game of coding was limited to scenarios involving only two nodes. In this paper, we generalize the game of coding framework to scenarios with $N \ge 2$ nodes, exploring critical aspects of system behavior. Specifically, we (i) demonstrate that the adversary's utility at equilibrium is non-increasing with additional adversarial nodes, ensuring no gain for the adversary and no pain for the DC, thus establishing the game of coding framework's Sybil resistance; (ii) show that increasing the number of honest nodes does not always enhance the DC's utility, providing examples and proposing an algorithm to identify and mitigate this counterintuitive effect; and (iii) outline the optimal strategies for both the DC and the adversary, demonstrating that the system achieves enhanced liveness at equilibrium.</p></details> |  |
| **[Forward Symbolic Execution for Trustworthy Automation of Binary Code Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.08848v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Control flow in unstructured programs can be complex and dynamic, which makes static analysis difficult. Yet, automated reasoning about unstructured control flow is important when certifying properties of binary (machine) code in trustworthy systems, e.g., cryptographic routines. We present a theory of forward symbolic execution for unstructured programs suitable for use in theorem provers that enables automated verification of both functional and non-functional program properties. The theory's foundation is a set of inference rules where each member corresponds to an operation in a symbolic execution engine. The rules are designed to give control over the tradeoff between the preservation of precision and introduction of overapproximation. We instantiate our theory for BIR, a previously proposed intermediate language for binary analysis. We demonstrate how symbolic executors can be constructed for BIR with common optimizations such as pruning of infeasible symbolic states. We implemented our theory in the HOL4 theorem prover using the HolBA binary analysis library, obtaining machine-checked proofs of soundness of symbolic execution for BIR. We practically evaluated two applications of our theory: verification of functional properties of RISC-V binaries and verification of execution time bounds of programs running on the ARM Cortex-M0 processor. The evaluation shows that such verification can be automated with moderate overhead on medium-sized programs.</p></details> |  |

Based on these conditions, we construct a family of $2$-D classical QC-LDPC codes with girth greater than $4$ by stacking $p \times p \times p$ tensors, where $p$ is an odd prime. Furthermore, for composite values of $p$, we propose two additional families of $2$-D classical LDPC codes obtained via similar tensor stacking. In this case, one family achieves girth greater than $4$, while the other attains girth greater than $6$. All the proposed $2$-D classical QC-LDPC codes exhibit an erasure correction capability of at least $p \times p$. Based on the constructed classical $2$-D QC-LDPC codes, we derive two families of $2$-D entanglement-assisted (EA) quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes. The first family of $2$-D EA-QLDPC codes is obtained from a pair of binary $2$-D classical LDPC codes and is designed such that the unassisted part of the Tanner graph of the resulting EA-QLDPC code is free of cycles of length four, while requiring only a single ebit to be shared across the quantum transceiver. The second family is constructed from a single $2$-D classical LDPC code whose Tanner graph is free from $4$-cycles. Moreover, the constructed EA-QLDPC codes inherit an erasure correction capability of $p \times p$, as the underlying classical codes possess the same erasure correction property.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

Our framework absorbs the discrete phase space of a qudit into a hybrid phase space parameterizable entirely by the continuous variables of a harmonic oscillator. The unit cell of a hybrid quantum lattice grows with the qudit dimension, yielding a way to simultaneously measure an arbitrarily large range of non-commuting position and momentum displacements. Simple hybrid states can be obtained by applying a conditional displacement to a Gottesman-Kitaev-Preskill (GKP) state and a Pauli eigenstate, or by encoding some of the physical qudits of a stabilizer state into a GKP code. The states' oscillator-qudit entanglement cannot be generated using symplectic (i.e., Gaussian-Clifford) operations, distinguishing them as a resource from tensor products of oscillator and qudit stabilizer states. Simple hybrid codes can be thought of as subsystem GKP codes whose gauge factor is entangled with a qudit. Our numerical investigations suggest that such codes can sometimes outperform GKP codes against physical noise, and their decoders can be tuned to accommodate either more qudit or more oscillator errors. We also relate stabilizer codes to non-commutative tori, identifying that a general construction of such tori yields multi-mode multi-qudit extensions of GKP codes. We explicitly calculate these codes' logical dimension and logical operators by utilizing the Morita equivalence between their stabilizer and logical tori. We provide examples using commutation matrices, integer symplectic matrices, and binary codes.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages + appendices, 5 figures</p></details> |

While their structural properties-such as bounds and constructions-have been extensively studied, the performance of LRCs under random erasures and errors has remained largely unexplored. In this work, we study the error- and erasure-correction performance of binary linear LRCs under majority-logic decoding (MLD). Focusing on LRCs with fixed locality and varying availability, we derive explicit upper bounds on the probability of decoding failure over the memoryless Binary Erasure Channel (BEC) and Binary Symmetric Channel (BSC). Our analysis characterizes the behavior of the bit-error rate (BER) and block-error rate (BLER) as functions of the locality and availability parameters. We show that, under mild growth conditions on the availability, the block decoding failure probability vanishes asymptotically, and that majority-logic decoding can successfully correct virtually all of error and erasure patterns of weight linear in the blocklength. The results reveal a substantial gap between worst-case guarantees and typical performance under stochastic channel models.</p></details> |  |

More precisely, we have established formula for counting codewords in the linear code C whose i-th coordinate is nonzero. Moreover, we derived a MacWilliam's type identity, relating the normalized support enumerators of a linear code and its dual, explaining how coordinate information transforms under duality. Using this identity we deduce a condition for self duality based on the equality of support distributions. These results provide a more detailed understanding of code structure and complement classical weight based duality theory.</p></details> |  |

Evaluations against 17 state-of-the-art LLMs, including ~50x larger models like Sonnet 3.7, DeepSeek-R1, and GPT-4.1, show that TerraFormer improves correctness over its base LLM by 15.94% on IaC-Eval, 11.65% on TF-Gen (Test), and 19.60% on TF-Mutn (Test).

| **[Multivariate Polynomial Codes for Efficient Matrix Chain Multiplication in Distributed Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08708v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of computing matrix chain multiplications in a distributed computing cluster. In such systems, performance is often limited by the straggler problem, where the slowest worker dominates the overall computation latency. To resolve this issue, several coded computing strategies have been proposed, primarily focusing on the simplest case: the multiplication of two matrices. These approaches successfully alleviate the straggler effect, but they do so at the expense of higher computational complexity and increased storage needs at the workers. However, in many real-world applications, computations naturally involve long chains of matrix multiplications rather than just a single two-matrix product. Extending univariate polynomial coding to this setting has been shown to amplify the costs -- both computation and storage overheads grow significantly, limiting scalability. In this work, we propose two novel multivariate polynomial coding schemes specifically designed for matrix chain multiplication in distributed environments. Our results show that while multivariate codes introduce additional computational cost at the workers, they can dramatically reduce storage overhead compared to univariate extensions. This reveals a fundamental trade-off between computation and storage efficiency, and highlights the potential of multivariate codes as a practical solution for large-scale distributed linear algebra tasks.</p></details> |  |

Objective: This paper explores the incorporation of code-specific and general-purpose Large Language Models (LLMs) to automate critical software security tasks, such as identifying vulnerabilities, predicting severity and access complexity, and generating fixes as a proof of concept. Method: We evaluate five pairs of recent LLMs, including both code-based and general-purpose open-source models, on two recognized C/C++ vulnerability datasets, namely Big-Vul and Vul-Repair. Additionally, we compare fine-tuning and prompt-based approaches. Results: The results show that fine-tuning uniformly outperforms both zero-shot and few-shot approaches across all tasks and models. Notably, code-specialized models excel in zero-shot and few-shot settings on complex tasks, while general-purpose models remain nearly as effective. Discrepancies among CodeBLEU, CodeBERTScore, BLEU, and ChrF highlight the inadequacy of current metrics for measuring repair quality. Conclusions: This study contributes to the software security community by investigating the potential of advanced LLMs to improve vulnerability analysis and remediation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the Fourth International Workshop on Software Vulnerability Management (SVM 2026) co-located with Intenational Conference in Software Engineering (ICSE 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Unifying Appearance Codes and Bilateral Grids for Driving Scene Gaussian Splatting](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.05280v4)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural rendering techniques, including NeRF and Gaussian Splatting (GS), rely on photometric consistency to produce high-quality reconstructions. However, in real-world scenarios, it is challenging to guarantee perfect photometric consistency in acquired images. Appearance codes have been widely used to address this issue, but their modeling capability is limited, as a single code is applied to the entire image. Recently, the bilateral grid was introduced to perform pixel-wise color mapping, but it is difficult to optimize and constrain effectively. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-scale bilateral grid that unifies appearance codes and bilateral grids. We demonstrate that this approach significantly improves geometric accuracy in dynamic, decoupled autonomous driving scene reconstruction, outperforming both appearance codes and bilateral grids. This is crucial for autonomous driving, where accurate geometry is important for obstacle avoidance and control. Our method shows strong results across four datasets: Waymo, NuScenes, Argoverse, and PandaSet. We further demonstrate that the improvement in geometry is driven by the multi-scale bilateral grid, which effectively reduces floaters caused by photometric inconsistency.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025 ; Project page: https://bigcileng.github.io/bilateral-driving ; Code: https://github.com/BigCiLeng/bilateral-driving</p></details> |

In this paper, we propose an algebraic construction based on dyadic matrices for designing both classical and quantum LDPC codes. The method first generates classical binary quasi-dyadic LDPC codes whose Tanner graphs have girth 6. It is then extended to the Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) framework, where the two component parity-check matrices are built to satisfy the compatibility condition required by the recently introduced CAMEL-ensemble quaternary belief propagation decoder. This compatibility condition ensures that all unavoidable cycles of length 4 are assembled in a single variable node, allowing the mitigation of their detrimental effects by decimating that variable node.</p></details> | Submitted to IEEE |

In this paper, we introduce HiKE: the Hierarchical Korean-English code-switching benchmark, the first globally accessible non-synthetic evaluation framework for Korean-English CS, aiming to provide a means for the precise evaluation of multilingual ASR models and to foster research in the field. The proposed framework not only consists of high-quality, natural CS data across various topics, but also provides meticulous loanword labels and a hierarchical CS-level labeling scheme (word, phrase, and sentence) that together enable a systematic evaluation of a model's ability to handle each distinct level of code-switching. Through evaluations of diverse multilingual ASR models and fine-tuning experiments, this paper demonstrates that although most multilingual ASR models initially exhibit inadequate CS-ASR performance, this capability can be enabled through fine-tuning with synthetic CS data. HiKE is available at https://github.com/ThetaOne-AI/HiKE.</p></details> | EACL Findings 2026 |

Using this framework, we obtain asymptotically good CSS codes that fault-tolerantly realize the logical transversal Clifford group. Furthermore, investigating CSS-T codes, we: (a) demonstrate asymptotically good CSS-T codes wherein the transversal $T$ realizes the logical transversal $S^{\dagger}$; (b) show that the condition $C_2 \ast C_1 \subseteq C_1^{\perp}$ is necessary but not sufficient for CSS-T codes; and (c) revise the characterizations of CSS-T codes wherein the transversal $T$ implements the logical identity and the logical transversal $T$, respectively.</p></details> |  |

In particular, recent advancements have demonstrated the shuttling of electron and hole spin qubits through a quantum dot array with high fidelity. It is therefore timely to explore error correction architectures consisting merely of two parallel quantum dot arrays, an experimentally validated architecture compatible with classical wiring and control constraints. Upon such an architecture, we develop a suite of heuristic methods for compiling any Calderbank-Shor-Steane (CSS) error-correcting code's syndrome-extraction circuit to run with a reduced number of shuttling operations. We demonstrate how column-regular qLDPC codes can be compiled in a provably minimal number of shuttles that is exactly equal to the column weight of the code when Shor-style syndrome extraction is used. We provide tables stating the number of required shuttles for many contemporary codes of interest. In addition, we provide a proof of the NP hardness of minimizing the number of shuttle operations for general codes, even when using Shor syndrome extraction. We also discuss how one could get around this by placing blanks in the ancilla array to achieve minimal shuttles with Shor syndrome extraction on any CSS code, at the cost of longer ancilla arrays.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 15 figures.

At its core, financial regulations often comprise highly intricate provisions, layered logical structures, and numerous exceptions, which inevitably result in labor-intensive or comprehension challenges. To mitigate this, recent Regulatory Technology (RegTech) and Large Language Models (LLMs) have gained significant attention in automating the conversion of regulatory text into executable compliance logic. However, their performance remains suboptimal particularly when applied to Chinese-language financial regulations, due to three key limitations: (1) incomplete domain-specific knowledge representation, (2) insufficient hierarchical reasoning capabilities, and (3) failure to maintain temporal and logical coherence. One promising solution is to develop a domain specific and code-oriented datasets for model training. Existing datasets such as LexGLUE, LegalBench, and CODE-ACCORD are often English-focused, domain-mismatched, or lack fine-grained granularity for compliance code generation. To fill these gaps, we present Compliance-to-Code, the first large-scale Chinese dataset dedicated to financial regulatory compliance. Covering 1,159 annotated clauses from 361 regulations across ten categories, each clause is modularly structured with four logical elements-subject, condition, constraint, and contextual information-along with regulation relations. We provide deterministic Python code mappings, detailed code reasoning, and code explanations to facilitate automated auditing. To demonstrate utility, we present FinCheck: a pipeline for regulation structuring, code generation, and report generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Under-Explored Application for Explainable Multimodal Misogyny Detection in code-mixed Hindi-English](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08457v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Digital platforms have an ever-expanding user base, and act as a hub for communication, business, and connectivity. However, this has also allowed for the spread of hate speech and misogyny. Artificial intelligence models have emerged as an effective solution for countering online hate speech but are under explored for low resource and code-mixed languages and suffer from a lack of interpretability. Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) can enhance transparency in the decisions of deep learning models, which is crucial for a sensitive domain such as hate speech detection. In this paper, we present a multi-modal and explainable web application for detecting misogyny in text and memes in code-mixed Hindi and English. The system leverages state-of-the-art transformer-based models that support multilingual and multimodal settings. For text-based misogyny identification, the system utilizes XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R) and multilingual Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (mBERT) on a dataset of approximately 4,193 comments. For multimodal misogyny identification from memes, the system utilizes mBERT + EfficientNet, and mBERT + ResNET trained on a dataset of approximately 4,218 memes. It also provides feature importance scores using explainability techniques including Shapley Additive Values (SHAP) and Local Interpretable Model Agnostic Explanations (LIME). The application aims to serve as a tool for both researchers and content moderators, to promote further research in the field, combat gender based digital violence, and ensure a safe digital space. The system has been evaluated using human evaluators who provided their responses on Chatbot Usability Questionnaire (CUQ) and User Experience Questionnaire (UEQ) to determine overall usability.</p></details> |  |

By formulating the encryption encoding problem as the selection of $2^\ell$ points in the discrete $\ell$-dimensional torus $\mathbb{Z}_q^\ell$, the proposed construction maximizes the minimum $L_2$-norm toroidal distance to reduce the decryption failure rate (DFR) in post-quantum schemes such as the NIST ML-KEM (Crystals-Kyber). For $\ell = 2$, we show that the MTD code is essentially a variant of the Minal code recently introduced at IACR CHES 2025. For $\ell = 4$, we present a construction based on the $D_4$ lattice that achieves the largest known toroidal distance, while for $\ell = 8$, the MTD code corresponds to $2E_8$ lattice points in $\mathbb{Z}_4^8$. Numerical evaluations under the Kyber setting show that the proposed codes outperform both Minal and maximum Lee-distance ($L_1$-norm) codes in DFR for $\ell > 2$, while matching Minal code performance for $\ell = 2$.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Taxon: Hierarchical Tax Code Prediction with Semantically Aligned LLM Expert Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08418v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tax code prediction is a crucial yet underexplored task in automating invoicing and compliance management for large-scale e-commerce platforms. Each product must be accurately mapped to a node within a multi-level taxonomic hierarchy defined by national standards, where errors lead to financial inconsistencies and regulatory risks. This paper presents Taxon, a semantically aligned and expert-guided framework for hierarchical tax code prediction. Taxon integrates (i) a feature-gating mixture-of-experts architecture that adaptively routes multi-modal features across taxonomy levels, and (ii) a semantic consistency model distilled from large language models acting as domain experts to verify alignment between product titles and official tax definitions. To address noisy supervision in real business records, we design a multi-source training pipeline that combines curated tax databases, invoice validation logs, and merchant registration data to provide both structural and semantic supervision. Extensive experiments on the proprietary TaxCode dataset and public benchmarks demonstrate that Taxon achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines. Further, an additional full hierarchical paths reconstruction procedure significantly improves structural consistency, yielding the highest overall F1 scores. Taxon has been deployed in production within Alibaba's tax service system, handling an average of over 500,000 tax code queries per day and reaching peak volumes above five million requests during business event with improved accuracy, interpretability, and robustness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Distillation with CoT Guidance for Edge-Drone Control Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08412v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With large language models demonstrating significant potential in code generation tasks, their application to onboard control of resource-constrained Unmanned Aerial Vehicles has emerged as an important research direction. However, a notable contradiction exists between the high resource consumption of large models and the real-time, lightweight requirements of UAV platforms. This paper proposes an integrated approach that combines knowledge distillation, chain-of-thought guidance, and supervised fine-tuning for UAV multi-SDK control tasks, aiming to efficiently transfer complex reasoning and code generation capabilities to smaller models. Firstly, a high-quality dataset covering various mainstream UAV SDKs is constructed, featuring instruction-code-reasoning chains, and incorporates counterfactual negative samples for data augmentation, guiding the model to learn the end-to-end logic from instruction parsing to code generation. Secondly, leveraging DeepSeek-Coder-V2-Lite quantized via QLoRA as the teacher model, and based on a hybrid black-box and white-box distillation strategy, high-quality chain-of-thought soft labels are generated. These are combined with a weighted cross-entropy loss using hard labels to transfer complex reasoning capabilities to the smaller student model. Finally, through prompt tuning engineering optimized for the UAV control scenario, the model performance on core tasks such as SDK type recognition and function call matching is enhanced. Experimental results indicate that the distilled lightweight model maintains high code generation accuracy while achieving significant improvements in deployment and inference efficiency, effectively demonstrating the feasibility and superiority of our approach in achieving precise and lightweight intelligent control for UAVs</p></details> | <details><summary>2nd I...</summary><p>2nd International Conference on Drones and Unmanned Systems (DAUS' 2026)</p></details> |

To ease the treatment, we mainly describe our algorithm as a technique to sample a dual-containing binary LDPC code, hence, a sparse matrix $\mathbf H\in\mathbb F_2^{r\times n}$ such that $\mathbf H\mathbf H^\top = \mathbf 0$. However, as we show, the algorithm can be easily generalized to sample dual-containing LDPC codes over non binary finite fields as well as more general quantum stabilizer LDPC codes. While several constructions already exist, all of them are somewhat algebraic as they impose some specific property (e.g., the matrix being quasi-cyclic). Instead, our algorithm is purely combinatorial as we do not require anything apart from the rows of $\mathbf H$ being sparse enough. In this sense, we can think of our algorithm as a way to sample sparse, self-orthogonal matrices that are as random as possible. Our algorithm is conceptually very simple and, as a key ingredient, uses Information Set Decoding (ISD) to sample the rows of $\mathbf H$, one at a time. The use of ISD is fundamental as, without it, efficient sampling would not be feasible. We give a theoretical characterization of our algorithm, determining which ranges of parameters can be sampled as well as the expected computational complexity. Numerical simulations and benchmarks confirm the feasibility and efficiency of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[SolContractEval: A Benchmark for Evaluating Contract-Level Solidity Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23824v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of blockchain has brought smart contracts into mainstream use, creating a demand for smart contract generation tools. While large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code in general-purpose languages, their effectiveness on Solidity, the primary language for smart contracts, remains underexplored. Solidity constitutes only a small portion of typical LLM training data and differs from general-purpose languages in its version-sensitive syntax and limited flexibility. These factors raise concerns about the reliability of existing LLMs for Solidity code generation. Critically, existing evaluations, focused on isolated functions and synthetic inputs, fall short of assessing models' capabilities in real-world contract development. To bridge this gap, we introduce SolContractEval, the first contract-level benchmark for Solidity code generation. It comprises 124 tasks drawn from real on-chain contracts across nine major domains. Each task input, consisting of complete context dependencies, a structured contract framework, and a concise task prompt, is independently annotated and cross-validated by experienced developers. To enable precise and automated evaluation of functional correctness, we also develop a dynamic evaluation framework based on historical transaction replay. Building on SolContractEval, we perform a systematic evaluation of six mainstream LLMs. We find that Claude-3.7-Sonnet achieves the highest overall performance, though evaluated models underperform relative to their capabilities on class-level generation tasks in general-purpose programming languages. Second, current models perform better on tasks that follow standard patterns but struggle with complex logic and inter-contract dependencies. Finally, they exhibit limited understanding of Solidity-specific features and contextual dependencies.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE 2025 |

In the domain of TCAD simulation, however, the scarcity of open-source resources hinders language models from generating valid TCAD code. To overcome this limitation, we construct an open-source TCAD dataset curated by experts and fine-tune a domain-specific model for TCAD code generation. Building on this foundation, we propose AgenticTCAD, a natural language - driven multi-agent framework that enables end-to-end automated device design and optimization. Validation on a 2 nm nanosheet FET (NS-FET) design shows that AgenticTCAD achieves the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS)-2024 device specifications within 4.2 hours, whereas human experts required 7.1 days with commercial tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by DATE 2026</p></details> |

Nonetheless, verifying the correctness and executability of LLM-generated code remains a significant challenge, as traditional methods rely on language-specific compilers and environment-dependent runtimes. To overcome these limitations, we introduce StackPilot, an LLM-native, multi-agent framework designed for language-agnostic code verification and execution, which operates independently of conventional toolchains. StackPilot offers three principal innovations: (1) a Function-as-Agents paradigm, in which each function is modeled as an autonomous agent capable of fine-grained reasoning and collaborative verification; (2) an LLM-as-Executor strategy, which enables scalable verification via stack-based scheduling; and (3) a novel snapshot mechanism that preserves complete execution contexts, facilitating deterministic and lossless context switching during verification. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that StackPilot achieves framework reliability rates between 89% and 97%, substantially outperforming baseline approaches. These results indicate that StackPilot can reliably verify and execute a significantly larger proportion of LLM-generated code across diverse programming tasks compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This method needs to be reconsidered and there is something wrong with experiment</p></details> |

Manually finding the best solver configuration is a difficult, time-consuming task that typically requires expert knowledge. In this paper, we introduce probe and solve algorithm, a novel two-phase framework for automated hyperparameter optimization integrated into the CPMpy library. This approach partitions the available time budget into two phases: a probing phase that explores different sets of hyperparameters using configurable hyperparameter optimization methods, followed by a solving phase where the best configuration found is used to tackle the problem within the remaining time. We implement and compare two hyperparameter optimization methods within the probe and solve algorithm: Bayesian optimization and Hamming distance search. We evaluate the algorithm on two different constraint programming solvers, ACE and Choco, across 114 combinatorial problem instances, comparing their performance against the solver's default configurations. Results show that using Bayesian optimization, the algorithm outperforms the solver's default configurations, improving solution quality for ACE in 25.4% of instances and matching the default performance in 57.9%, and for Choco, achieving superior results in 38.6% of instances. It also consistently surpasses Hamming distance search within the same framework, confirming the advantage of model-based exploration over simple local search. Overall, the probe and solve algorithm offers a practical, resource-aware approach for tuning constraint solvers that yields robust improvements across diverse problem types.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, 3 figures.

We argue that competitive programming is fundamentally a problem-solving task and propose centering natural-language editorials in both solution generation and evaluation. Generating an editorial prior to code improves solve rates for some LLMs, with substantially larger gains when using expertly written gold editorials. However, even with gold editorials, models continue to struggle with implementation, while the gap between generated and gold editorials reveals a persistent problem-solving bottleneck in specifying correct and complete algorithms. Beyond pass/fail metrics, we diagnose reasoning errors by comparing model-generated editorials to gold standards using expert annotations and validate an LLM-as-a-judge protocol for scalable evaluation. We introduce a dataset of 83 ICPC-style problems with gold editorials and full test suites, and evaluate 19 LLMs, arguing that future benchmarks should explicitly separate problem solving from implementation.</p></details> |  |

Despite progress in basic shape-morphing design with simple geometries, achieving advanced applications such as conformal implant deployment or aerodynamic morphing requires accurate and diverse morphing designs on complex geometries, which remains challenging. Here, we present a Spectral and Spatial Neural Operator (S2NO), which enables high-fidelity morphing prediction on complex geometries. S2NO effectively captures global and local morphing behaviours on irregular computational domains by integrating Laplacian eigenfunction encoding and spatial convolutions. Combining S2NO with evolutionary algorithms enables voxel-level optimisation of material distributions for shape morphing programming on various complex geometries, including irregular-boundary shapes, porous structures, and thin-walled structures. Furthermore, the neural operator's discretisation-invariant property enables super-resolution material distribution design, further expanding the diversity and complexity of morphing design. These advancements significantly improve the efficiency and capability of programming complex shape morphing.</p></details> | 20 pages,5 Figures |

An adaptive feature program has recently been proposed to analyze feature learning, the characteristic property of neural networks, in a more abstract way. Motivated by the celebrated Le Cam equivalence, we advocate the over-parameterized sequence models to further simplify the analysis of the training dynamics of adaptive feature program and present several pieces of supporting evidence for the adaptive feature program. More precisely, after having introduced the feature error measure (FEM) to characterize the quality of the learned feature, we show that the FEM is decreasing during the training process of several concrete adaptive feature models including linear regression, single/multiple index models, etc. We believe that this hints at the potential successes of the adaptive feature program.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning Distillation for Lightweight Automated Program Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10987v1)** | 2026-01-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study whether lightweight symbolic reasoning supervision can improve fix type classification in compact automated program repair models. Small code models are attractive for resource-constrained settings, but they typically produce only a single prediction, making it unclear whether they learn meaningful program structure or rely on shallow correlations. We propose a reasoning distillation approach in which a large teacher model provides structured symbolic reasoning tags alongside fix-type labels. These tags capture high-level causal properties of bugs without relying on free-form explanations. We train a CodeT5-based student model under label-only and reasoning-distilled settings on the IntroClass benchmark. Reasoning supervision consistently improves macro averaged performance, particularly on less frequent bug categories, without increasing model size or complexity. We further analyze the relationship between reasoning accuracy and fix-type prediction, showing that correct reasoning traces strongly correlate with correct predictions, while not fully determining them. Our results suggest that symbolic reasoning distillation is a practical way to improve interpretability and robustness in lightweight program repair models.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 tables.

We introduce a graph-compliant decomposition framework that brings message passing into continuous optimization in a rigorous, implementable, and provable way. The (hyper)graph is partitioned into tree clusters (hypertree factor graphs). At each iteration, agents update in parallel by solving local subproblems whose objective splits into an {\it intra}-cluster term summarized by cost-to-go messages from one min-sum sweep on the cluster tree, and an {\it inter}-cluster coupling term handled Jacobi-style using the latest out-of-cluster variables. To reduce computation/communication, the method supports graph-compliant surrogates that replace exact messages/local solves with compact low-dimensional parametrizations; in hypergraphs, the same principle enables surrogate hyperedge splitting, to tame heavy hyperedge overlaps while retaining finite-time intra-cluster message updates and efficient computation/communication. We establish convergence for (strongly) convex and nonconvex objectives, with topology- and partition-explicit rates that quantify curvature/coupling effects and guide clustering and scalability. To our knowledge, this is the first convergent message-passing method on loopy graphs.</p></details> | 55 pages, 15 figures |

Such 2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained (e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence of natural and artificial intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to TMLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Are Language Models Efficient Reasoners? A Perspective from Logic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25626v2)** | 2026-01-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities, yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect of reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming, introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through irrelevant inferences.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

Multi-agentic collaborative frameworks using such LLMs place them at the center of solving software development-related tasks such as code generation. However, direct use of LLM generated code in production software development systems is problematic. The code could be unstable or erroneous and contain vulnerabilities such as data poisoning, malicious attacks, and hallucinations that could lead to widespread system malfunctions. This prohibits the adoption of LLM generated code in production AI systems where human code reviews and traditional secure testing tools are impractical or untrustworthy. In this paper, we discuss safety and reliability problems with the execution of LLM generated code and propose a Secure Transpiler and Executor of LLM-Generated Program (STELP), capable of executing LLM-generated code in a controlled and safe manner. STELP secures autonomous production AI systems involving code generation, filling the critical void left by the impracticality or limitations of traditional secure testing methodologies and human oversight. This includes applications such as headless code generation-execution and LLMs that produce executable code snippets as an action plan to be executed in real time. We contribute a human-validated dataset of insecure code snippets and benchmark our approach on publicly available datasets for correctness, safety, and latency. Our results demonstrate that our approach outperforms an existing method by a significant margin, particularly in its ability to safely execute risky code snippets. Warning: This paper contains malicious code snippets that should be run with caution.</p></details> |  |

We developed Mark My Works, a local autograding system that combines traditional unit testing with LLM-generated explanations. The system uses role-based prompts to analyze submissions, critique code quality, and generate pedagogical feedback while maintaining transparency in its reasoning process. We piloted the system in a 191-student engineering course, comparing AI-generated assessments with human grading on 79 submissions. While AI scores showed no linear correlation with human scores (r = -0.177, p = 0.124), both systems exhibited similar left-skewed distributions, suggesting they recognize comparable quality hierarchies despite different scoring philosophies. The AI system demonstrated more conservative scoring (mean: 59.95 vs 80.53 human) but generated significantly more detailed technical feedback.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Fun for Teaching Large Programming Courses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09842v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teaching software development basics to hundreds of students in a frontal setting is cost-efficient and thus still common in universities. However, in a large lecture hall, students can easily get bored, distracted, and disengaged. The frontal setting can also frustrate lecturers since interaction opportunities are limited and hard to scale. Fun activities can activate students and, if well designed, can also help remember and reflect on abstract software development concepts. We present a novel catalogue of ten physical fun activities, developed over years to reflect on basic programming and software development concepts. The catalogue includes the execution of a LA-OLA algorithm as in stadiums, using paper planes to simulate object messages and pointers, and traversing a lecture hall as a tree or a recursive structure. We report our experience of using the activities in a large course with 500+ students three years in a row. We also conducted an interview study with 15 former students of the course and 14 experienced educators from around the globe. The results suggest that the fun activities can enable students to stay focused, remember key concepts, and reflect afterwards. However, keeping the activities concise and clearly linked to the concepts taught seems to be key to their acceptance and effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2026 IEEE/ACM 48th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE-SEET '26)</p></details> |

Adhering to these conventions improves maintainability, understandability, and extensibility. Additionally, following best practices during software development enhances performance and reduces the likelihood of errors. This paper analyzes 1,036 popular open-source JAVA projects on GITHUB to study how code style and programming practices are adopted and evolve over time, examining their prevalence and the most common violations. Additionally, we study a subset of active repositories on a monthly basis to track changes in adherence to coding standards over time. We found widespread violations across repositories, with Javadoc and Naming violations being the most common. We also found a significant number of violations of the GOOGLE Java Style Guide in categories often missed by modern static analysis tools. Furthermore, repositories claiming to follow code-style practices exhibited slightly higher overall adherence to code-style and best-practices. The results provide valuable insights into the adoption of code style and programming practices, highlighting key areas for improvement in the open-source development community. Furthermore, the paper identifies important lessons learned and suggests future directions for improving code quality in JAVA projects.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in IEEE International Conference on Software Maintenance and Evolution (ICSME 2025).

Traditional symbolic execution of programs with numeric inputs enjoys the property of forking as many analysis traces as the number of analyzed program paths, a property that in this paper we refer to as path optimality. On the contrary, current approaches for symbolic execution of heap-manipulating programs fail to satisfy this property, thereby incurring crucial path explosion effects. This paper introduces POSE, path-optimal symbolic execution, a symbolic execution algorithm that originally achieves path optimality against heap-manipulating programs. We formalize the POSE algorithm and experiment it against a benchmark of programs that take data structures as inputs, supporting the potential of POSE for improving on the state of the art of symbolic execution of heap-manipulating programs.</p></details> | 18 pages, 14 figures |

The only explicitly documented approach evaluates a quadratic dynamic program over the full $n\times m$ grid, which is prohibitive on large inputs. We present two exact algorithms. First, we give a simple $Θ(nm)$-time baseline that computes LCBS by combining a longest common increasing subsequence (LCIS) computation on $(A,B)$ with a second LCIS computation on the reversed inputs, and then maximizing $INC(i,j)+DEC(i,j)-1$ over all common peaks. The method is constructive via parent pointers. Second, we develop an \emph{instance-sensitive} algorithm whose running time depends on the number $\mathcal{M}$ of matching pairs $(i,j)$ with $A[i]=B[j]$. We view matches as vertices of a dominance-ordered poset and compute the increasing and decreasing halves by two 2D dominance DP passes supported by orthogonal range-maximum data structures, followed by a linear peak scan. With a standard 2D range tree (or equivalent), this yields $O(\mathcal{M}\log^{2}\mathcal{M} + \mathcal{M} + (n+m)\log(n+m))$ time and $O(\mathcal{M}\log \mathcal{M})$ space, and it improves over the dense baseline whenever $M\log^2 M\ll nm$.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 2 figres, In the process of submission to 37th Annual Symposium on Combinatorial Pattern Matching</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Generate Reliable Test Case Generators? A Study on Competition-Level Programming Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.06821v4)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation, capable of tackling complex tasks during inference. However, the extent to which LLMs can be utilized for code checking or debugging through test case generation remains largely unexplored. We investigate this problem from the perspective of competition-level programming (CP) programs and propose TCGBench, a Benchmark for (LLM generation of) Test Case Generators. This benchmark comprises two tasks, aimed at studying the capabilities of LLMs in (1) generating valid test case generators for a given CP problem, and further (2) generating targeted test case generators that expose bugs in human-written code. Experimental results indicate that while state-of-the-art LLMs can generate valid test case generators in most cases, most LLMs struggle to generate targeted test cases that reveal flaws in human code effectively. Especially, even advanced reasoning models (e.g., o3-mini) fall significantly short of human performance in the task of generating targeted generators. Furthermore, we construct a high-quality, manually curated dataset of instructions for generating targeted generators. Analysis demonstrates that the performance of LLMs can be enhanced with the aid of this dataset, by both prompting and fine-tuning.</p></details> | 37 pages, 22 figures |
| **[Formally Verifying Noir Zero Knowledge Programs with NAVe](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09372v1)** | 2026-01-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Zero-Knowledge (ZK) proof systems are cryptographic protocols that can (with overwhelming probability) demonstrate that the pair $(X, W)$ is in a relation $R$ without revealing information about the private input $W$. This membership checking is captured by a complex arithmetic circuit: a set of polynomial equations over a finite field. ZK programming languages, like Noir, have been proposed to simplify the description of these circuits. A developer can write a Noir program using traditional high-level constructs that can be compiled into a lower-level ACIR (Abstract Circuit Intermediate Representation), which is essentially a high-level description of an arithmetic circuit. In this paper, we formalise some of the ACIR language using SMT-LIB and its extended theory of finite fields. We use this formalisation to create an open-source formal verifier for the Noir language using the SMT solver cvc5. Our verifier can be used to check whether Noir programs behave appropriately. For instance, it can be used to check whether a Noir program has been properly constrained, that is, the finite-field polynomial equations generated truly capture the intended relation. We evaluate our verifier over 4 distinct sets of Noir programs, demonstrating its practical applicability and identifying a hard-to-check constraint type that charts an improvement path for our verification framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Population-Level Parallelism in Tree-Based Genetic Programming for GPU Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17168v6)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tree-based Genetic Programming (TGP) is a widely used evolutionary algorithm for tasks such as symbolic regression, classification, and robotic control. Due to the intensive computational demands of running TGP, GPU acceleration is crucial for achieving scalable performance. However, efficient GPU-based execution of TGP remains challenging, primarily due to three core issues: (1) the structural heterogeneity of program individuals, (2) the complexity of integrating multiple levels of parallelism, and (3) the incompatibility between high-performance CUDA execution and flexible Python-based environments. To address these issues, we propose EvoGP, a high-performance framework tailored for GPU acceleration of TGP via population-level parallel execution. First, EvoGP introduces a tensorized representation that encodes variable-sized trees into fixed-shape, memory-aligned arrays, enabling uniform memory access and parallel computation across diverse individuals. Second, EvoGP adopts an adaptive parallelism strategy that dynamically combines intra- and inter-individual parallelism based on dataset size, ensuring high GPU utilization across a broad spectrum of tasks. Third, EvoGP embeds custom CUDA kernels into the PyTorch runtime, achieving seamless integration with Python-based environments such as Gym, MuJoCo, Brax, and Genesis. Experimental results demonstrate that EvoGP achieves a peak throughput exceeding $10^{11}$ GPops/s. Specifcially, this performance represents a speedup of up to $304\times$ over existing GPU-based TGP implementations and $18\times$ over state-of-the-art CPU-based libraries. Furthermore, EvoGP maintains comparable accuracy and exhibits improved scalability across large population sizes. EvoGP is open source and accessible at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/evogp.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learner-Tailored Program Repair: A Solution Generator with Iterative Edit-Driven Retrieval Enhancement](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08545v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the development of large language models (LLMs) in the field of programming, intelligent programming coaching systems have gained widespread attention. However, most research focuses on repairing the buggy code of programming learners without providing the underlying causes of the bugs. To address this gap, we introduce a novel task, namely \textbf{LPR} (\textbf{L}earner-Tailored \textbf{P}rogram \textbf{R}epair). We then propose a novel and effective framework, \textbf{\textsc{\MethodName{}}} (\textbf{L}earner-Tailored \textbf{S}olution \textbf{G}enerator), to enhance program repair while offering the bug descriptions for the buggy code. In the first stage, we utilize a repair solution retrieval framework to construct a solution retrieval database and then employ an edit-driven code retrieval approach to retrieve valuable solutions, guiding LLMs in identifying and fixing the bugs in buggy code. In the second stage, we propose a solution-guided program repair method, which fixes the code and provides explanations under the guidance of retrieval solutions. Moreover, we propose an Iterative Retrieval Enhancement method that utilizes evaluation results of the generated code to iteratively optimize the retrieval direction and explore more suitable repair strategies, improving performance in practical programming coaching scenarios. The experimental results show that our approach outperforms a set of baselines by a large margin, validating the effectiveness of our framework for the newly proposed LPR task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Formalization and Implementation of Safe Destination Passing in Pure Functional Programming Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08529v1)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Destination-passing style programming introduces destinations, which represent the address of a write-once memory cell. These destinations can be passed as function parameters, allowing the caller to control memory management: the callee simply fills the cell instead of allocating space for a return value. While typically used in systems programming, destination passing also has applications in pure functional programming, where it enables programs that were previously unexpressible using usual immutable data structures. In this thesis, we develop a core λ-calculus with destinations, {λ_d}. Our new calculus is more expressive than similar existing systems, with destination passing designed to be as flexible as possible. This is achieved through a modal type system combining linear types with a system of ages to manage scopes, in order to make destination-passing safe. Type safety of our core calculus was proved formally with the Coq proof assistant. Then, we see how this core calculus can be adapted into an existing pure functional language, Haskell, whose type system is less powerful than our custom theoretical one. Retaining safety comes at the cost of removing some flexibility in the handling of destinations. We later refine the implementation to recover much of this flexibility, at the cost of increased user complexity. The prototype implementation in Haskell shows encouraging results for adopting destination-passing style programming when traversing or mapping over large data structures such as lists or data trees.</p></details> | <details><summary>PhD M...</summary><p>PhD Manuscript, 148 pages.

| **[Optimal Extended Formulations from Optimal Dynamic Programming Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.06947v2)** | 2026-01-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vertex Subset Problems (VSPs) are a class of combinatorial optimization problems on graphs where the goal is to find a subset of vertices satisfying a predefined condition. Two prominent approaches for solving VSPs are dynamic programming over tree-like structures, such as tree decompositions or clique decompositions, and linear programming. In this work, we establish a sharp connection between both approaches by showing that if a vertex-subset problem $Π$ admits a solution-preserving dynamic programming algorithm that produces tables of size at most $α(k,n)$ when processing a tree decomposition of width at most $k$ of an $n$-vertex graph $G$, then the polytope $P_Π(G)$ defined as the convex-hull of solutions of $Π$ in $G$ has extension complexity at most $O(α(k,n)\cdot n)$. Additionally, this upper bound is optimal under the exponential time hypothesis (ETH). On the one hand, our results imply that ETH-optimal solution-preserving dynamic programming algorithms for combinatorial problems yield optimal-size parameterized extended formulations for the solution polytopes associated with instances of these problems. On the other hand, unconditional lower bounds obtained in the realm of the theory of extended formulations yield unconditional lower bounds on the table complexity of solution-preserving dynamic programming algorithms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Minimizing energy dissipation during programming of resistive switching memory devices using their dynamical attractor states](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18053v2)** | 2026-01-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Under certain conditions, applying a sequence of voltage pulses of alternating polarities across a resistive switching memory device induces a finite number of fixed-point attractors in its time-averaged dynamics, known as dynamical attractors. Remarkably, dynamical attractors can be used to program analog values into the device state without supervision. Because different pulse sequences can produce the same trajectory solution for the state in the phase space, there is strong potential for optimization, particularly regarding the energy cost of the programming phase, which this study addresses. The proposed theory-based energy minimization strategy is applied to the voltage threshold adaptive memristor (VTEAM) model, which is known for its predictive capability and adaptability in fitting a large number of resistive switching memory devices. The optimization design crafts ad-hoc pulse sequences that minimize the energy required to program the device into a desired dynamical attractor. The theoretical approach is also extended to cover situations where a fast programming scheme should be adopted to serve time-critical electronics applications.</p></details> |  |

However, current Code LLMs still rely heavily on real-world data, which limits their scalability. In this paper, we explore a fully synthetic approach: training Code LLMs with entirely generated tasks, solutions, and test cases, to empower code reasoning models without relying on real-world data. To support this, we leverage feature-based synthesis to propose a novel data synthesis pipeline called SynthSmith. SynthSmith shows strong potential in producing diverse and challenging tasks, along with verified solutions and tests, supporting both supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Based on the proposed synthetic SFT and RL datasets, we introduce the X-Coder model series, which achieves a notable pass rate of 62.9 avg@8 on LiveCodeBench v5 and 55.8 on v6, outperforming DeepCoder-14B-Preview and AReal-boba2-14B despite having only 7B parameters. In-depth analysis reveals that scaling laws hold on our synthetic dataset, and we explore which dimensions are more effective to scale. We further provide insights into code-centric reinforcement learning and highlight the key factors that shape performance through detailed ablations and analysis. Our findings demonstrate that scaling high-quality synthetic data and adopting staged training can greatly advance code reasoning, while mitigating reliance on real-world coding data.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project: https://github.com/JieWu02/X-Coder</p></details> |

The notion of FO-completeness is a theoretical guarantee that all theorems that are valid when recursive definitions are interpreted as fixpoint definitions (instead of least fixpoint) are guaranteed to be eventually proven by the system. The logics we develop are a frame logic ($\textit{FL}$) and a separation logic ($\textit{SL-FL}$) that has an alternate semantics inspired by frame logic. We show verification condition generation for FL that is amenable to FO-complete reasoning using quantifier instantiation and SMT solvers. We show $\textit{SL-FL}$ can be translated to FL in order to obtain FO-complete reasoning. We implement tools that realize our technique and show the expressiveness of our logics and the efficacy of the verification technique on a suite of benchmarks that manipulate data structures.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared in OOPSLA '25</p></details> |

Conventional MILP solving mainly relies on carefully designed heuristics embedded in the branch-and-bound framework. Driven by the strong capabilities of neural networks, recent research is exploring the value of machine learning alongside conventional MILP solving. Although learning-based MILP methods have shown great promise, existing works typically learn policies for individual modules in MILP solvers in isolation, without considering their interdependence, which limits both solving efficiency and solution quality. To address this limitation, we propose Collab-Solver, a novel multi-agent-based policy learning framework for MILP that enables collaborative policy optimization for multiple modules. Specifically, we formulate the collaboration between cut selection and branching in MILP solving as a Stackelberg game. Under this formulation, we develop a two-phase learning paradigm to stabilize collaborative policy learning: the first phase performs data-communicated policy pretraining, and the second phase further orchestrates the policy learning for various modules. Extensive experiments on both synthetic and large-scale real-world MILP datasets demonstrate that the jointly learned policies significantly improve solving performance. Moreover, the policies learned by Collab-Solver have also demonstrated excellent generalization abilities across different instance sets.</p></details> |  |

Through systematic analysis of programming language token representations, we characterize how programming languages are encoded in LLM tokenizers by analyzing their vocabulary distribution and keyword coverage patterns. We introduce a novel cold-start probability analysis method that provides insights into model behavior without requiring explicit prompts. Additionally, we present a comprehensive evaluation of how different model optimization techniques - including quantization, distillation, model scaling, and task-specific fine-tuning - affect token-level representations and code generation quality. Our experiments, supported by comprehensive probability distribution analysis and evaluation metrics, reveal critical insights into token-level behavior and provide empirically-validated guidelines for maintaining code generation quality under various optimization constraints. These findings advance both theoretical understanding of LLM code generation and practical implementation of optimized models in production environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 1 figure and 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[Rethinking Basis Path Testing: Mixed Integer Programming Approach for Test Path Set Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05463v1)** | 2026-01-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Basis path testing is a cornerstone of structural testing, yet traditional automated methods, relying on greedy graph-traversal algorithms (e.g., DFS/BFS), often generate sub-optimal paths. This structural inferiority is not a trivial issue; it directly impedes downstream testing activities by complicating automated test data generation and increasing the cognitive load for human engineers. This paper reframes basis path generation from a procedural search task into a declarative optimization problem. We introduce a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) framework designed to produce a complete basis path set that is globally optimal in its structural simplicity. Our framework includes two complementary strategies: a Holistic MIP model that guarantees a theoretically optimal path set, and a scalable Incremental MIP strategy for large, complex topologies. The incremental approach features a multi-objective function that prioritizes path simplicity and incorporates a novelty penalty to maximize the successful generation of linearly independent paths. Empirical evaluations on both real-code and large-scale synthetic Control Flow Graphs demonstrate that our Incremental MIP strategy achieves a 100\% success rate in generating complete basis sets, while remaining computationally efficient. Our work provides a foundational method for generating a high-quality structural "scaffold" that can enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of subsequent test generation efforts.</p></details> |  |

DafnyPro comprises three key components: a diff-checker that prevents modifications to base program logic, a pruner that removes unnecessary invariants, and a hint-augmentation system that retrieves and applies predefined, problem-independent proof strategies. We evaluate DafnyPro using Claude Sonnet 3.5 and 3.7 on four benchmarks: Clover, MBPP-Dafny, HumanEval-Dafny, and DafnyBench, achieving consistent performance gains in all cases. Notably, on DafnyBench, the most challenging benchmark, Claude Sonnet 3.5 enhanced with DafnyPro achieves 86% correct proofs, a 16 pp improvement over the base model. We also fine-tune two Qwen models on training data derived from verification attempts by larger models enhanced with DafnyPro. Our 7B and 14B models achieve 68% and 70% correct proofs on DafnyBench, respectively, demonstrating that smaller models can maintain high verification accuracy.</p></details> |  |

Our approach uses Skolemization to reduce the mixed-quantifier synthesis problem to a $\forall^*$-synthesis problem, synthesizing witness-generating functions for introduced Skolem symbols alongside the target program. We tackle $\forall^*$-synthesis using a sketching-based, enumerative, counterexample-guided approach. Our algorithm learns syntactic constraints from counterexamples to prune the candidate space and employs a prophylactic pruning technique to avoid enumerating invalid candidates altogether. We evaluate our technique on 42 benchmarks, demonstrating that both counterexample generalization and prophylactic pruning significantly improve performance.</p></details> |  |

However, most high-performing methods such as neural networks and ensemble methods are often opaque, limiting trust and broader adoption.

This paper proposes a hybrid approach that integrates ASP-derived rules from the FOLD-R++ algorithm with black-box ML classifiers to selectively correct uncertain predictions and provide human-readable explanations.

However, numerous potential security vulnerabilities persist in practical applications. New language features in Rust pose new challenges for vulnerability detection. This paper proposes a static deadlock detection method tailored for Rust programs, aiming to identify various deadlock types, including double lock, conflict lock, and deadlock associated with conditional variables. With due consideration for Rust's ownership and lifetimes, we first complete the pointer analysis. Then, based on the obtained points-to information, we analyze dependencies among variables to identify potential deadlocks. We develop a tool and conduct experiments based on the proposed method. The experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms existing deadlock detection methods in precision.</p></details> |  |

Conventionally, they are modeled as classical planning problems. In this paper, we argue that it can be beneficial to formulate them as universal planning problems, particularly when the agents are autonomous entities and may encounter unforeseen situations. We therefore propose universal plans, also known as policies, as the solution concept, and implement a system based on Answer Set Programming (ASP) to compute them. Given an arbitrary two-dimensional map and a profile of goals for a group of partially observable agents, the system translates the problem configuration into logic programs and finds a feasible universal plan for each agent, mapping its observations to actions while ensuring that there are no collisions with other agents. We use the system to conduct experiments and obtain findings regarding the types of goal profiles and environments that lead to feasible policies, as well as how feasibility may depend on the agents' sensors. We also demonstrate how users can customize action preferences to compute more efficient policies, even (near-)optimal ones.

Among other things, explainablility for deep neural networks has been a topic of intensive research due to the meteoric rise in prominence of deep neural networks and their "black-box" nature. xAI approaches can be characterized along different dimensions such as their scope (global versus local explanations) or underlying methodologies (statistic-based versus rule-based strategies). Methods generating global explanations aim to provide reasoning process applicable to all possible output classes while local explanation methods focus only on a single, specific class. SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations), a well-known statistical technique, identifies important features of a network. Deep neural network rule extraction method constructs IF-THEN rules that link input conditions to a class. Another approach focuses on generating counterfactuals which help explain how small changes to an input can affect the model's predictions. However, these techniques primarily focus on the input-output relationship and thus neglect the structure of the network in explanation generation. In this work, we propose xDNN(ASP), an explanation generation system for deep neural networks that provides global explanations. Given a neural network model and its training data, xDNN(ASP) extracts a logic program under answer set semantics that-in the ideal case-represents the trained model, i.e., answer sets of the extracted program correspond one-to-one to input-output pairs of the network. We demonstrate experimentally, using two synthetic datasets, that not only the extracted logic program maintains a high-level of accuracy in the prediction task, but it also provides valuable information for the understanding of the model such as the importance of features as well as the impact of hidden nodes on the prediction. The latter can be used as a guide for reducing the number of nodes used in hidden layers, i.e., providing a means for optimizing the network.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2025, arXiv:2601.00047</p></details> |
| **[Formally Explaining Decision Tree Models with Answer Set Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03845v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decision tree models, including random forests and gradient-boosted decision trees, are widely used in machine learning due to their high predictive performance. However, their complex structures often make them difficult to interpret, especially in safety-critical applications where model decisions require formal justification. Recent work has demonstrated that logical and abductive explanations can be derived through automated reasoning techniques. In this paper, we propose a method for generating various types of explanations, namely, sufficient, contrastive, majority, and tree-specific explanations, using Answer Set Programming (ASP). Compared to SAT-based approaches, our ASP-based method offers greater flexibility in encoding user preferences and supports enumeration of all possible explanations. We empirically evaluate the approach on a diverse set of datasets and demonstrate its effectiveness and limitations compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2025, arXiv:2601.00047</p></details> |
| **[XAI-LAW: A Logic Programming Tool for Modeling, Explaining, and Learning Legal Decisions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03844v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an approach to model articles of the Italian Criminal Code (ICC), using Answer Set Programming (ASP), and to semi-automatically learn legal rules from examples based on prior judicial decisions. The developed tool is intended to support legal experts during the criminal trial phase by providing reasoning and possible legal outcomes. The methodology involves analyzing and encoding articles of the ICC in ASP, including "crimes against the person" and property offenses. The resulting model is validated on a set of previous verdicts and refined as necessary. During the encoding process, contradictions may arise; these are properly handled by the system, which also generates possible decisions for new cases and provides explanations through a tool that leverages the "supportedness" of stable models. The automatic explainability offered by the tool can also be used to clarify the logic behind judicial decisions, making the decision-making process more interpretable. Furthermore, the tool integrates an inductive logic programming system for ASP, which is employed to generalize legal rules from case examples.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2025, arXiv:2601.00047</p></details> |
| **[On the Trap Space Semantics of Normal Logic Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03842v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The logical semantics of normal logic programs has traditionally been based on the notions of Clark's completion and two-valued or three-valued canonical models, including supported, stable, regular, and well-founded models. Two-valued interpretations can also be seen as states evolving under a program's update operator, producing a transition graph whose fixed points and cycles capture stable and oscillatory behaviors, respectively. We refer to this view as dynamical semantics since it characterizes the program's meaning in terms of state-space trajectories, as first introduced in the stable (supported) class semantics. Recently, we have established a formal connection between Datalog^\neg programs (i.e., normal logic programs without function symbols) and Boolean networks, leading to the introduction of the trap space concept for Datalog^\neg programs. In this paper, we generalize the trap space concept to arbitrary normal logic programs, introducing trap space semantics as a new approach to their interpretation. This new semantics admits both model-theoretic and dynamical characterizations, providing a comprehensive approach to understanding program behavior. We establish the foundational properties of the trap space semantics and systematically relate it to the established model-theoretic semantics, including the stable (supported), stable (supported) partial, regular, and L-stable model semantics, as well as to the dynamical stable (supported) class semantics. Our results demonstrate that the trap space semantics offers a unified and precise framework for proving the existence of supported classes, strict stable (supported) classes, and regular models, in addition to uncovering and formalizing deeper relationships among the existing semantics of normal logic programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2025, arXiv:2601.00047</p></details> |
| **[Defeasible Conditionals using Answer Set Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03840v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Defeasible entailment is concerned with drawing plausible conclusions from incomplete information. A foundational framework for modelling defeasible entailment is the KLM framework. Introduced by Kraus, Lehmann, and Magidor, the KLM framework outlines several key properties for defeasible entailment. One of the most prominent algorithms within this framework is Rational Closure (RC). This paper presents a declarative definition for computing RC using Answer Set Programming (ASP). Our approach enables the automatic construction of the minimal ranked model from a given knowledge base and supports entailment checking for specified queries. We formally prove the correctness of our ASP encoding and conduct empirical evaluations to compare the performance of our implementation with that of existing imperative implementations, specifically the InfOCF solver. The results demonstrate that our ASP-based approach adheres to RC's theoretical foundations and offers improved computational efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2025, arXiv:2601.00047</p></details> |

The approach builds on a conditional logic with typicality, and on the combination of a conditional knowledge base with an ASP program, and allows for conditional reasoning over the answer sets of the program. The formalism relies on a multi-preferential semantics, and on the KLM preferential semantics, as a special case. Conditional entailment is encoded in ASP and a complexity upper-bound is provided.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2025, arXiv:2601.00047</p></details> |
| **[Logic Programming with Extensible Types](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03836v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logic programming languages present clear advantages in terms of declarativeness and conciseness. However, the ideas of logic programming have been met with resistance in other programming communities, and have not generally been adopted by other paradigms and languages. This paper proposes a novel way to incorporate logic programming in an existing codebase in a typed functional programming language. Our approach integrates with the host language without sacrificing static typing, and leverages strengths of typed functional programming such as polymorphism and higher-order. We do so by combining three ideas. First, we use the extensible types technique to allow values of the host language to contain logic variables. Second, we implement a unification algorithm that works for any data structure that supports certain operations.Third, we introduce a domain-specific language to define and query predicates. We demonstrate our proposal via a series of examples, and provide aids to make the notation convenient for users, showing that the proposed approach is not just technically possible but also practical. Our ideas have been implemented in the language Haskell with very good results.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2025, arXiv:2601.00047</p></details> |

In this paper, we interpret models of QASP formulas in terms of policies, which represent decision-making strategies that determine how existentially quantified variables should be assigned, given the conditions set by universally quantified variables. As a main contribution, we present an algorithm for policy extraction under QASP semantics, inspired by the Equilibrium Logic semantics for general ASP theories.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings ICLP 2025, arXiv:2601.00047</p></details> |
| **[Assessing and Improving the Representativeness of Code Generation Benchmarks Using Knowledge Units (KUs) of Programming Languages -- An Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.03780v1)** | 2026-01-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4, Claude and LLaMA have shown impressive performance in code generation, typically evaluated using benchmarks (e.g., HumanEval). However, effective code generation requires models to understand and apply a wide range of language concepts. If the concepts exercised in benchmarks are not representative of those used in real-world projects, evaluations may yield incomplete. Despite this concern, the representativeness of code concepts in benchmarks has not been systematically examined. To address this gap, we present the first empirical study that analyzes the representativeness of code generation benchmarks through the lens of Knowledge Units (KUs) - cohesive sets of programming language capabilities provided by language constructs and APIs. We analyze KU coverage in two widely used Python benchmarks, HumanEval and MBPP, and compare them with 30 real-world Python projects. Our results show that each benchmark covers only half of the identified 20 KUs, whereas projects exercise all KUs with relatively balanced distributions. In contrast, benchmark tasks exhibit highly skewed KU distributions. To mitigate this misalignment, we propose a prompt-based LLM framework that synthesizes KU-based tasks to rebalance benchmark KU distributions and better align them with real-world usage. Using this framework, we generate 440 new tasks and augment existing benchmarks. The augmented benchmarks substantially improve KU coverage and achieve over a 60% improvement in distributional alignment. Evaluations of state-of-the-art LLMs on these augmented benchmarks reveal consistent and statistically significant performance drops (12.54-44.82%), indicating that existing benchmarks overestimate LLM performance due to their limited KU coverage. Our findings provide actionable guidance for building more realistic evaluations of LLM code-generation capabilities.</p></details> |  |

However, unlike biological evolution, most LLM-evolution frameworks are formulated as static optimization problems, overlooking the open-ended adversarial dynamics that characterize real-world evolutionary processes. Here, we study Digital Red Queen (DRQ), a simple self-play algorithm that embraces these so-called "Red Queen" dynamics via continual adaptation to a changing objective. DRQ uses an LLM to evolve assembly-like programs, called warriors, which compete against each other for control of a virtual machine in the game of Core War, a Turing-complete environment studied in artificial life and connected to cybersecurity. In each round of DRQ, the model evolves a new warrior to defeat all previous ones, producing a sequence of adapted warriors. Over many rounds, we observe that warriors become increasingly general (relative to a set of held-out human warriors). Interestingly, warriors also become less behaviorally diverse across independent runs, indicating a convergence pressure toward a general-purpose behavioral strategy, much like convergent evolution in nature. This result highlights a potential value of shifting from static objectives to dynamic Red Queen objectives. Our work positions Core War as a rich, controllable sandbox for studying adversarial adaptation in artificial systems and for evaluating LLM-based evolution methods. More broadly, the simplicity and effectiveness of DRQ suggest that similarly minimal self-play approaches could prove useful in other more practical multi-agent adversarial domains, like real-world cybersecurity or combating drug resistance.</p></details> | 14 pages, 13 figures |

In this paper, we consider integer programs with function calls and present a natural extension of our modular complexity analysis approach to the recursive setting based on a new form of ranking functions. Hence, our approach combines already existing powerful techniques on the "imperative" parts of the program and our novel ranking functions on the recursive parts. The strength of this combination is demonstrated by our implementation in the complexity analysis tool KoAT.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of our ESOP '26 article</p></details> |

The conventional methods, i.e., the fractional programming (FP) method and the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) algorithm, can be computationally demanding for two reasons: (i) they require inverting a sequence of matrices whose sizes are proportional to the number of antennas; (ii) they require tuning a set of Lagrange multipliers to account for the power constraints. The recently proposed method called the reduced WMMSE addresses the above two issues for a single cell. In contrast, for the multicell case, another recent method called the FastFP eliminates the large matrix inversion and the Lagrange multipliers by using an improved FP technique, but the update stepsize in the FastFP can be difficult to decide. As such, we propose integrating the deep unfolding network into the FastFP for the stepsize optimization. Numerical experiments show that the proposed method is much more efficient than the learning method based on the WMMSE algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, there is a notable lack of tools for testing and evaluating them, especially within the adaptable Multi-Level Intermediate Representation (MLIR) context. This paper addresses the need for a tool that can accommodate MLIR's extensibility, a feature not provided by previous methods such as Csmith. Here we introduce MLIR-Smith, a novel random program generator specifically designed to test and evaluate MLIR-based compiler optimizations. We demonstrate the utility of MLIR-Smith by conducting differential testing on MLIR, LLVM, DaCe, and DCIR, which led to the discovery of multiple bugs in these compiler pipelines. The introduction of MLIR-Smith not only fills a void in the realm of compiler testing but also emphasizes the importance of comprehensive testing within these systems. By providing a tool that can generate random MLIR programs, this paper enhances our ability to evaluate and improve compilers and paves the way for future tools, potentially shaping the wider landscape of software testing and quality assurance.</p></details> |  |

A Holistic Evaluation of Large Language Models for Code Generation in Functional Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.02060v1)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional programming provides strong foundations for developing reliable and secure software systems, yet its adoption remains not widespread due to the steep learning curve. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation present new opportunities to lower these barriers. However, extensive evaluations of LLMs largely focus on imperative programming languages, and their capabilities in functional programming languages (FP) remain underexplored. To address this gap, we introduce FPEval, a holistic evaluation framework built on FPBench, a new benchmark of 721 programming tasks across three difficulty levels on three mainstream FP languages: Haskell, Ocaml and Scala. FPEval provides compehensive evaluation infrastructures with both test validations with comprehensive test suites and static analysis tools to assess both functional correctness and code style and maintainability. Using this framework, we evaluate state-of-the-art LLMs, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4o, and GPT-5, for code generation in functional programming languages and Java as an imperative baseline. Our results demonstrate that LLM performance in functional programming improves substantially with model advancement; however, error rates remain significantly higher in purely functional languages (Haskell and OCaml) than in hybrid (Scala) or imperative (Java) languages. Moreover, LLMs frequently generate non-idiomatic functional code that follows imperative patterns, raising concerns about code style and long-term maintainability. Finally, we show that LLMs can partially self-repair both correctness and quality issues when provided with static analysis feedback and hand-crafted instructions for common types of issues.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoTEE: Automated Migration and Protection of Programs in Trusted Execution Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13379v2)** | 2026-01-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) isolate a special space within a device's memory that is not accessible to the normal world (also known as Untrusted Environment), even when the device is compromised. Thus, developers can utilize TEEs to provide strong security guarantees for their programs, making sensitive operations like encrypted data storage, fingerprint verification, and remote attestation protected from malicious attacks. Despite the strong protections offered by TEEs, adapting existing programs to leverage such security guarantees is non-trivial, often requiring extensive domain knowledge and manual intervention, which makes TEEs less accessible to developers. This motivates us to design AutoTEE, the first Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled approach that can automatically identify, partition, transform, and port sensitive functions into TEEs with minimal developer intervention. By manually reviewing 68 repositories, we constructed a benchmark dataset consisting of 385 sensitive functions eligible for transformation, on which AutoTEE achieves a high F1 score of 0.91. AutoTEE effectively transforms these sensitive functions into their TEE-compatible counterparts, achieving success rates of 90\% and 83\% for Java and Python, respectively. We further provide a mechanism to automatically port the transformed code to different TEE platforms, including Intel SGX and AMD SEV, demonstrating that the transformed programs run successfully and correctly on these platforms.</p></details> | 14 pages |

In ferroelectric resistive weights, the strength of the synaptic connection between two neurons is stored in the device conductance. During learning, programming pulses are applied to the synaptic weight, which reconfigures the ferroelectric domains and adjusts the conductance. One strategy to lower the energy cost during the training phase is to lower the duration of the programming pulses. However, the latter cannot be shorter than the self-loading time of the resistive weights, limited by intrinsic parasitics in the circuits. In this work, ferroelectric resistive weights are fabricated using a process compatible with CMOS Back-End-Of-Line integration, based on hafnia/zirconia nanolaminates. By laterally scaling the device area under 100 $μ$m$^2$, the self-loading time becomes sufficiently short to enable 20 ns programming, which corresponds to a maximum of 3 picoJoules per pulse. Further, in this work, the weight update rule with 20 ns pulses is experimentally measured not only for different amplitudes but also for different initial conductance states. We find that the final weight is determined by the pulse amplitude, independent of the initial weight value.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures.

This evolution has brought GPU security and reliability to the forefront of concerns. Prior research has shown that CUDA's lack of memory safety can lead to serious vulnerabilities. While fuzzing is effective for finding such bugs on CPUs, equivalent tools for GPUs are lacking due to architectural differences and lack of built-in error detection. In this paper, we propose CuFuzz, a novel compiler-runtime co-design solution to extend state-of-the-art CPU fuzzing tools to GPU programs. CuFuzz transforms GPU programs into CPU programs using compiler IR-level transformations to enable effective fuzz testing. To the best of our knowledge, CuFuzz is the first mechanism to bring fuzzing support to CUDA, addressing a critical gap in GPU security research. By leveraging CPU memory error detectors such as Address Sanitizer, CuFuzz aims to uncover memory safety bugs and related correctness vulnerabilities in CUDA code, enhancing the security and reliability of GPU-accelerated applications. To ensure high fuzzing throughput, we introduce two compiler-runtime co-optimizations tailored for GPU code: Partial Representative Execution (PREX) and Access-Index Preserving Pruning (AXIPrune), achieving average throughput improvements of 32x with PREX and an additional 33% gain with AXIPrune on top of PREX-optimized code. Together, these optimizations can yield up to a 224.31x speedup. In our fuzzing campaigns, CuFuzz uncovered 122 security vulnerabilities in widely used benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Most previous works consider numerical bounds over the whole program state space monolithically and do not consider piecewise bounds. Not surprisingly, monolithic bounds are either conservative, or not expressive and succinct enough in general. To derive better bounds, we propose a novel approach for synthesizing piecewise bounds over probabilistic programs. First, we show how to extract useful piecewise information from latticed $k$-induction operators, and combine the piecewise information with Optional Stopping Theorem to obtain a general approach to derive piecewise bounds over probabilistic programs. Second, we develop algorithms to synthesize piecewise polynomial bounds, and show that the synthesis can be reduced to bilinear programming in the linear case, and soundly relaxed to semidefinite programming in the polynomial case. Experimental results show that our approach generates tight piecewise bounds for a wide range of benchmarks when compared with the state of the art.</p></details> |  |

Still, it remains a time-consuming and challenging task. Existing frameworks like DomiKnowS help this integration by providing a high-level declarative programming interface, but they still assume the user is proficient with the library's specific syntax. We propose AgenticDomiKnowS (ADS) to eliminate this dependency. ADS translates free-form task descriptions into a complete DomiKnowS program using an agentic workflow that creates and tests each DomiKnowS component separately. The workflow supports optional human-in-the-loop intervention, enabling users familiar with DomiKnowS to refine intermediate outputs. We show how ADS enables experienced DomiKnowS users and non-users to rapidly construct neuro-symbolic programs, reducing development time from hours to 10-15 minutes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Infinite-Width Limit of a Single Attention Layer: Analysis via Tensor Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00846v3)** | 2026-01-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern theoretical analyses of neural networks, the infinite-width limit is often invoked to justify Gaussian approximations of neuron preactivations (e.g., via neural network Gaussian processes or Tensor Programs). However, these Gaussian-based asymptotic theories have so far been unable to capture the behavior of attention layers, except under special regimes such as infinitely many heads or tailored scaling schemes. In this paper, leveraging the Tensor Programs framework, we rigorously identify the infinite-width limit distribution of variables within a single attention layer under realistic architectural dimensionality and standard $1/\sqrt{n}$-scaling with $n$ dimensionality. We derive the exact form of this limit law without resorting to infinite-head approximations or tailored scalings, demonstrating that it departs fundamentally from Gaussianity. This limiting distribution exhibits non-Gaussianity from a hierarchical structure, being Gaussian conditional on the random similarity scores. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical predictions, confirming the effectiveness of our theory at finite width and accurate description of finite-head attentions. Beyond characterizing a standalone attention layer, our findings lay the groundwork for developing a unified theory of deep Transformer architectures in the infinite-width regime.</p></details> |  |

Recent approaches leveraging large language models (LLMs) have shown promise but face limitations. Most rely solely on static analysis, ignoring runtime behaviors. Some attempt to incorporate dynamic signals, but these are often restricted to training or fine-tuning, or injected only once into the repair prompt, without iterative use. This fails to fully capture program execution. Current iterative repair frameworks typically rely on coarse-grained feedback, such as pass/fail results or exception types, and do not leverage fine-grained execution-level information effectively. As a result, models struggle to simulate human stepwise debugging, limiting their effectiveness in multi-step reasoning and complex bug repair. To address these challenges, we propose DynaFix, an execution-level dynamic information-driven APR method that iteratively leverages runtime information to refine the repair process. In each repair round, DynaFix captures execution-level dynamic information such as variable states, control-flow paths, and call stacks, transforming them into structured prompts to guide LLMs in generating candidate patches. If a patch fails validation, DynaFix re-executes the modified program to collect new execution information for the next attempt. This iterative loop incrementally improves patches based on updated feedback, similar to the stepwise debugging practices of human developers. We evaluate DynaFix on the Defects4J v1.2 and v2.0 benchmarks. DynaFix repairs 186 single-function bugs, a 10% improvement over state-of-the-art baselines, including 38 bugs previously unrepaired. It achieves correct patches within at most 35 attempts, reducing the patch search space by 70% compared with existing methods, thereby demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency in repairing complex bugs.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 7 figures, preprint version</p></details> |

Large language models (LLMs) have recently demonstrated their potential for enhancing the degree of automation in formal verification by, e.g., generating formal specifications as essential to deductive verification, yet exhibit poor scalability due to long-context reasoning limitations and, more importantly, the difficulty of inferring complex, interprocedural specifications. This paper presents Preguss -- a modular, fine-grained framework for automating the generation and refinement of formal specifications. Preguss synergizes between static analysis and deductive verification by steering two components in a divide-and-conquer fashion: (i) potential runtime error-guided construction and prioritization of verification units, and (ii) LLM-aided synthesis of interprocedural specifications at the unit level. We show that Preguss substantially outperforms state-of-the-art LLM-based approaches and, in particular, it enables highly automated RTE-freeness verification for real-world programs with over a thousand LoC, with a reduction of 80.6%~88.9% human verification effort.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at OOPSLA 2026</p></details> |
| **[Robust Bayesian Dynamic Programming for On-policy Risk-sensitive Reinforcement Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.24580v1)** | 2025-12-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a novel framework for risk-sensitive reinforcement learning (RSRL) that incorporates robustness against transition uncertainty. We define two distinct yet coupled risk measures: an inner risk measure addressing state and cost randomness and an outer risk measure capturing transition dynamics uncertainty. Our framework unifies and generalizes most existing RL frameworks by permitting general coherent risk measures for both inner and outer risk measures. Within this framework, we construct a risk-sensitive robust Markov decision process (RSRMDP), derive its Bellman equation, and provide error analysis under a given posterior distribution. We further develop a Bayesian Dynamic Programming (Bayesian DP) algorithm that alternates between posterior updates and value iteration. The approach employs an estimator for the risk-based Bellman operator that combines Monte Carlo sampling with convex optimization, for which we prove strong consistency guarantees. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the algorithm converges to a near-optimal policy in the training environment and analyze both the sample complexity and the computational complexity under the Dirichlet posterior and CVaR. Finally, we validate our approach through two numerical experiments. The results exhibit excellent convergence properties while providing intuitive demonstrations of its advantages in both risk-sensitivity and robustness. Empirically, we further demonstrate the advantages of the proposed algorithm through an application on option hedging.</p></details> | 63 pages |

One-shot methods such as SparseGPT offer a practical trade-off in optimality by applying efficient, approximate heuristic weight updates. To close this gap, we introduce OPTIMA, a practical one-shot post-training pruning method that balances accuracy and scalability. OPTIMA casts layer-wise weight reconstruction after mask selection as independent, row-wise Quadratic Programs (QPs) that share a common layer Hessian. Solving these QPs yields the per-row globally optimal update with respect to the reconstruction objective given the estimated Hessian. The shared-Hessian structure makes the problem highly amenable to batching on accelerators. We implement an accelerator-friendly QP solver that accumulates one Hessian per layer and solves many small QPs in parallel, enabling one-shot post-training pruning at scale on a single accelerator without fine-tuning. OPTIMA integrates with existing mask selectors and consistently improves zero-shot performance across multiple LLM families and sparsity regimes, yielding up to 3.97% absolute accuracy improvement. On an NVIDIA H100, OPTIMA prunes a 8B-parameter transformer end-to-end in 40 hours with 60GB peak memory. Together, these results set a new state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-offs for one-shot post-training pruning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Reinforcement Learning Optimization for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems via Event-Triggered Robust Adaptive Dynamic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15735v4)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work proposes a unified control architecture that couples a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven controller with a disturbance-rejection Extended State Observer (ESO), complemented by an Event-Triggered Mechanism (ETM) to limit unnecessary computations. The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation. The inclusion of the ETM ensures that parameter updates of the learning module are executed only when the state deviation surpasses a predefined bound, thereby preventing excessive learning activity and substantially reducing computational load. A Lyapunov-oriented analysis is used to characterize the stability properties of the resulting closed-loop system. Numerical experiments further confirm that the developed approach maintains strong control performance and disturbance tolerance, while achieving a significant reduction in sampling and processing effort compared with standard time-triggered ADP schemes.</p></details> | 9 pages, 9 figures |
| **[A Proof-of-Concept for Explainable Disease Diagnosis Using Large Language Models and Answer Set Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23932v1)** | 2025-12-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate disease prediction is vital for timely intervention, effective treatment, and reducing medical complications. While symbolic AI has been applied in healthcare, its adoption remains limited due to the effort required for constructing high-quality knowledge bases. This work introduces McCoy, a framework that combines Large Language Models (LLMs) with Answer Set Programming (ASP) to overcome this barrier. McCoy orchestrates an LLM to translate medical literature into ASP code, combines it with patient data, and processes it using an ASP solver to arrive at the final diagnosis. This integration yields a robust, interpretable prediction framework that leverages the strengths of both paradigms. Preliminary results show McCoy has strong performance on small-scale disease diagnosis tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mechanically Programming the Cross-Sectional Shape of Soft Growing Robotic Structures for Patient Transfer](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11593v3)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pneumatic soft everting robotic structures have the potential to facilitate human transfer tasks due to their ability to grow underneath humans without sliding friction and their utility as a flexible sling when deflated. Tubular structures naturally yield circular cross-sections when inflated, whereas a robotic sling must be both thin enough to grow between them and their resting surface and wide enough to cradle the human. Recent works have achieved flattened cross-sections by including rigid components into the structure, but this reduces conformability to the human. We present a method of mechanically programming the cross-section of soft everting robotic structures using flexible strips that constrain radial expansion between points along the outer membrane. Our method enables simultaneously wide and thin profiles while maintaining the full multi-axis flexibility of traditional slings. We develop and validate a model relating the geometric design specifications to the fabrication parameters, and experimentally characterize their effects on growth rate. Finally, we prototype a soft growing robotic sling system and demonstrate its use for assisting a single caregiver in bed-to-chair patient transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interactive Robot Programming for Surface Finishing via Task-Centric Mixed Reality Interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23616v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lengthy setup processes that require robotics expertise remain a major barrier to deploying robots for tasks involving high product variability and small batch sizes. As a result, collaborative robots, despite their advanced sensing and control capabilities, are rarely used for surface finishing in small-scale craft and manufacturing settings. To address this gap, we propose a novel robot programming approach that enables non-experts to intuitively program robots through interactive, task-focused workflows. For that, we developed a new surface segmentation algorithm that incorporates human input to identify and refine workpiece regions for processing. Throughout the programming process, users receive continuous visual feedback on the robot's learned model, enabling them to iteratively refine the segmentation result. Based on the segmented surface model, a robot trajectory is generated to cover the desired processing area. We evaluated multiple interaction designs across two comprehensive user studies to derive an optimal interface that significantly reduces user workload, improves usability and enables effective task programming even for users with limited practical experience.</p></details> | <details><summary>Curre...</summary><p>Currently under review at Intelligent Service Robotics</p></details> |

A Large-scale Study on Security Risks in LLM and Agentic Automated Program Repair on SWE-bench](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.02976v3)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) and their agentic frameworks are increasingly adopted to perform development tasks such as automated program repair (APR). While prior work has identified security risks in LLM-generated code, most have focused on synthetic, simplified, or isolated tasks that lack the complexity of real-world program repair. In this study, we present the first large-scale security analysis of LLM-generated patches using 20,000+ GitHub issues. We evaluate patches proposed by developers, a standalone LLM (Llama 3.3 Instruct-70B), and three top-performing agentic frameworks (OpenHands, AutoCodeRover, HoneyComb). Finally, we analyze a wide range of code, issue, and project-level factors to understand the conditions under which generating insecure patches is more likely. Our findings reveal that Llama introduces many new vulnerabilities, exhibiting unique patterns not found in developers' code. Agentic workflows also generate a number of vulnerabilities, particularly when given more autonomy. We find that vulnerabilities in LLM-generated patches are associated with distinctive code characteristics and are commonly observed in issues missing specific types of information. These results suggest that contextual factors play a critical role in the security of the generated patches and point toward the need for proactive risk assessment methods that account for both issue and code-level information.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraint programming model and biased random-key genetic algorithm for the single-machine coupled task scheduling problem with exact delays to minimize the makespan](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23150v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the strongly NP-hard single-machine coupled task scheduling problem with exact delays to minimize the makespan. In this problem, a set of jobs has to be scheduled, each composed of two tasks interspersed by an exact delay. Given that no preemption is allowed, the goal consists of minimizing the completion time of the last scheduled task. We model the problem using constraint programming (CP) and propose a biased random-key genetic algorithm (BRKGA). Our CP model applies well-established global constraints. Our BRKGA combines some successful components in the literature: an initial solution generator, periodical restarts and shakes, and a local search algorithm. Furthermore, the BRKGA's decoder is focused on efficiency rather than optimality, which accelerates the solution space exploration. Computational experiments on a benchmark set containing instances with up to 100 jobs (200 tasks) indicate that the proposed BRKGA can efficiently explore the problem solution space, providing high-quality approximate solutions within low computational times. It can also provide better solutions than the CP model under the same computational settings, i.e., three minutes of time limit and a single thread. The CP model, when offered a longer running time of 3600 seconds and multiple threads, significantly improved the results, reaching the current best-known solution for 90.56% of these instances. Finally, our experiments highlight the importance of the shake and local search components in the BRKGA, whose combination significantly improves the results of a standard BRKGA.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lower bounds on pure dynamic programming for connectivity problems on graphs of bounded path-width](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.23121v1)** | 2025-12-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We give unconditional parameterized complexity lower bounds on pure dynamic programming algorithms - as modeled by tropical circuits - for connectivity problems such as the Traveling Salesperson Problem. Our lower bounds are higher than the currently fastest algorithms that rely on algebra and give evidence that these algebraic aspects are unavoidable for competitive worst case running times. Specifically, we study input graphs with a small width parameter such as treewidth and pathwidth and show that for any $k$ there exists a graph $G$ of pathwidth at most $k$ and $k^{O(1)}$ vertices such that any tropical circuit calculating the optimal value of a Traveling Salesperson round tour uses at least $2^{Ω(k \log \log k)}$ gates. We establish this result by linking tropical circuit complexity to the nondeterministic communication complexity of specific compatibility matrices. These matrices encode whether two partial solutions combine into a full solution, and Raz and Spieker [Combinatorica 1995] previously proved a lower bound for this complexity measure.</p></details> | 21 pages |
| **[MultiMend: Multilingual Program Repair with Context Augmentation and Multi-Hunk Patch Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16044v2)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging software remains a labor-intensive and time-consuming process despite advances in testing and verification. Learning-based automated program repair (APR) has shown promise in reducing the effort of manually fixing bugs. However, existing techniques face several challenges, including language-dependent strategies, limited bug context utilization, and difficulties in handling bugs that span multiple locations in the code. This paper presents MultiMend, a multilingual learning-based APR approach designed to improve repair performance through language-independent context augmentation and multi-hunk patch generation. MultiMend fine-tunes a pre-trained code language model to generate bug-fixing patches. It embeds source code lines and applies retrieval-augmented generation to augment the usual function-based buggy context with relevant lines during patch generation. The approach also systematically constructs patches for multi-hunk bugs to extend the capabilities of single-hunk models and reduce the needed patch validations. We evaluate MultiMend on six benchmarks with 5,501 bugs covering four programming languages and compare it with state-of-the-art methods. Results show that MultiMend achieves competitive effectiveness and efficiency, fixing 2,227 bugs, of which 1,545 are identical to the developer's patch, and 121 are for multi-hunk bugs. Both context augmentation and multi-hunk patch generation contribute positively to these results. Overall, MultiMend's contributions are promising and offer practical and effective techniques to enhance APR performance for real-world software maintenance.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM4FP: LLM-Based Program Generation for Triggering Floating-Point Inconsistencies Across Compilers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00256v2)** | 2025-12-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Floating-point inconsistencies across compilers can undermine the reliability of numerical software. We present LLM4FP, the first framework that uses Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate floating-point programs specifically designed to trigger such inconsistencies. LLM4FP combines Grammar-Based Generation and Feedback-Based Mutation to produce diverse and valid programs. We evaluate LLM4FP across multiple compilers and optimization levels, measuring inconsistency rate, time cost, and program diversity. LLM4FP detects nearly 2.5x the number of inconsistencies as the state-of-the-art tool Varity. Notably, most of the inconsistencies involve real-valued differences, rather than extreme values like NaN or infinities. LLM4FP also uncovers inconsistencies across a wider range of optimization levels, and finds the most mismatches between host and device compilers. These results show that LLM-guided program generation improves the detection of numerical inconsistencies. In practice, numerical software and HPC developers can use LLM4FP to compare compilers and select those that provide more accurate and consistent floating-point behavior, while compiler developers can use it to identify and address subtle consistency issues in their implementations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Program != "One-Size-Fits-All": Exploring Variations of Parsons Problems as Scaffolding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22407v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Lowering the barriers to computer programming requires understanding how to scaffold learning. Parsons problems, which require learners to drag-and-drop blocks of code into the correct order and indentation, are proving to be beneficial for scaffolding learning how to write code from scratch. But little is known about the ability of other problem types to do so. This study explores learners' perceptions of a new programming environment called Codespec, which was developed to make computer programming more accessible and equitable by offering multiple means of engagement. Retrospective think-aloud interviews were conducted with nine programmers who were given the choice between Faded Parsons and Pseudocode Parsons problems as optional scaffolding toward solving write-code problems. The results showed that offering Faded and Pseudocode Parsons problems as optional scaffolds supported comprehension monitoring, strategy formation, and refinement of prior knowledge. Learners selectively used Faded Parsons problems for syntax/structure and Pseudocode Parsons problems for high-level reasoning. The costs noted included the time it takes to drag-and-drop the blocks and the confusion experienced when a solution diverges from a learners' mental model. Faded Parsons problems were also perceived as a desirable challenge. This study contributes to the field of computing education and human-computer interaction by extending the functionality of problem spaces that support Parsons problems and by providing empirical evidence of the effectiveness of using other problem types as scaffolding techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[HALF: Process Hollowing Analysis Framework for Binary Programs with the Assistance of Kernel Modules](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.22043v1)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary program analysis is still very important in system security. There are many practical achievements in binary code analysis, but fine-grained analysis such as dynamic taint analysis, is constantly studied due to the problem of deployability, high memory usage, and performance overhead, so as to better adapt to the new analysis scenario, such as memory corruption exploits and sandbox evasion malware. This paper presents a new binary program analysis framework, in order to improve the usability and performance of fine-grained analysis. The framework mainly uses the kernel module to further expand the analysis capability of the traditional dynamic binary instrumentation. Then, based on the idea of decoupling analysis, the analysis environment is constructed in the container process through process hollowing techniques in a new way. It can reuse the functions of the existing dynamic binary instrumentation platforms and also reduce the impact on the execution of the target program. The prototype is implemented on the Windows platform. The validity and performance of the framework are verified by a large number of experiments with benchmark and actual programs. The effectiveness of the framework is also verified by the analysis of actual exploit programs and malicious code, demonstrating the value of the practical application.</p></details> |  |
| **[CP-Agent: Agentic Constraint Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07468v2)** | 2025-12-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating natural language into formal constraint models requires expertise in the problem domain and modeling frameworks. To investigate whether constraint modeling benefits from agentic workflows, we introduce CP-Agent, a Python coding agent using the ReAct framework with a persistent IPython kernel. Domain knowledge is provided through a project prompt of under 50 lines. The agent iteratively executes code, observes the solver's feedback, and refines models based on the execution results. We evaluate CP-Agent on CP-Bench's 101 constraint programming problems. We clarified the benchmark to address systematic ambiguities in problem specifications and errors in ground-truth models. On the clarified benchmark, CP-Agent solves all 101 problems. Ablation studies indicate that minimal guidance outperforms detailed procedural scaffolding, and that explicit task management tools have mixed effects on focused modeling tasks.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a factor abstraction with five fundamental operations that serve as a universal interface for manipulating factors regardless of their underlying representation. This enables representation-agnostic probabilistic programming where users can freely mix different representations (e.g. discrete tables, Gaussians distributions, sample-based approaches) within a single unified framework, allowing practical inference in complex hybrid models that current toolkits cannot adequately express.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at LAFI@POPL25</p></details> |
| **[Quantitative Verification of Omega-regular Properties in Probabilistic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21596v1)** | 2025-12-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic programming provides a high-level framework for specifying statistical models as executable programs with built-in randomness and conditioning. Existing inference techniques, however, typically compute posterior distributions over program states at fixed time points, most often at termination, thereby failing to capture the temporal evolution of probabilistic behaviors. We introduce temporal posterior inference (TPI), a new framework that unifies probabilistic programming with temporal logic by computing posterior distributions over execution traces that satisfy omega-regular specifications, conditioned on possibly temporal observations. To obtain rigorous quantitative guarantees, we develop a new method for computing upper and lower bounds on the satisfaction probabilities of omega-regular properties. Our approach decomposes Rabin acceptance conditions into persistence and recurrence components and constructs stochastic barrier certificates that soundly bound each component. We implement our approach in a prototype tool, TPInfer, and evaluate it on a suite of benchmarks, demonstrating effective and efficient inference over rich temporal properties in probabilistic models.</p></details> |  |

An analysis of fifty-eight peer-reviewed studies published between 2022 and 2025 identified three primary categories of AI agents: chatbots, generative AI (GenAI), and intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), with GenAI being the most frequently studied. The primary instructional objectives reported include enhanced programming support in 94.83% of studies, motivational and emotional benefits in 18.96%, and increased efficiency for educators in 6.90%. Reported benefits include personalized feedback, improved learning outcomes, and time savings. The review also highlights challenges, such as setup barriers documented in 93.10% of studies, overreliance resulting in superficial learning in 65.52%, and concerns regarding AI errors and academic integrity. These findings suggest the need for instructional frameworks that prioritize the development of prompt engineering skills and human oversight to address these issues. This review provides educators and curriculum designers with an evidence-based foundation for the practical and ethical integration of AI in programming education.</p></details> |  |
| **[Error Localization, Certificates, and Hints for Probabilistic Program Verification via Slicing (Extended Version)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20214v2)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper focuses on effective user diagnostics generated during the deductive verification of probabilistic programs. Our key principle is based on providing slices for (1) error reporting, (2) proof simplification, and (3) preserving successful verification results. By formally defining these different notions on HeyVL, an existing quantitative intermediate verification language (IVL), our concepts (and implementation) can be used to obtain diagnostics for a range of probabilistic programming languages. Slicing for error reporting is a novel notion of error localization for quantitative assertions. We demonstrate slicing-based diagnostics on a variety of proof rules such as quantitative versions of the specification statement and invariant-based loop rules, and formally prove the correctness of specialized error messages and verification hints. We implemented our user diagnostics into the deductive verifier Caesar. Our novel implementation -- called \emph{Brutus} -- can search for slices which do or do not verify, corresponding to each of the three diagnostic notions. For error reporting (1), it exploits a binary search-based algorithm that minimizes error-witnessing slices. To solve for slices that verify (2 and 3), we empirically compare different algorithms based on unsatisfiable cores, minimal unsatisfiable subset enumeration, and a direct SMT encoding of the slicing problem. Our empirical evaluation of Brutus on existing and new benchmarks shows that we can find slices that are both small and informative.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the European Symposium on Programming (ESOP) 2026</p></details> |
| **[Artificial or Just Artful? Do LLMs Bend the Rules in Programming?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.21028v1)** | 2025-12-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are widely used for automated code generation, yet their apparent successes often mask a tension between pretraining objectives and alignment choices. While pretraining encourages models to exploit all available signals to maximize success, alignment, whether through fine-tuning or prompting, may restrict their use. This conflict is especially salient in agentic AI settings, for instance when an agent has access to unit tests that, although intended for validation, act as strong contextual signals that can be leveraged regardless of explicit prohibitions. In this paper, we investigate how LLMs adapt their code generation strategies when exposed to test cases under different prompting conditions. Using the BigCodeBench (Hard) dataset, we design five prompting conditions that manipulate test visibility and impose explicit or implicit restrictions on their use. We evaluate five LLMs (four open-source and one closed-source) across correctness, code similarity, program size, and code churn, and analyze cross-model consistency to identify recurring adaptation strategies. Our results show that test visibility dramatically alters performance, correctness nearly doubles for some models, while explicit restrictions or partial exposure only partially mitigate this effect. Beyond raw performance, we identify four recurring adaptation strategies, with test-driven refinement emerging as the most frequent. These results highlight how LLMs adapt their behavior when exposed to contextual signals that conflict with explicit instructions, providing useful insight into how models reconcile pretraining objectives with alignment constraints.</p></details> |  |

Visual programming addresses this by decomposing problems into steps calling specialized tools, yet existing methods rely on either fixed toolsets or speculative tool induction before solving problems, resulting in suboptimal programs and poor utilization of induced tools. We present Transductive Visual Programming (TVP), a novel framework that builds new tools from its own experience rather than speculation. TVP first solves problems using basic tools while accumulating experiential solutions into an Example Library, then abstracts recurring patterns from these programs into reusable higher-level tools for an evolving Tool Library. This allows TVP to tackle new problems with increasingly powerful tools learned from experience. On Omni3D-Bench, TVP achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming GPT-4o by 22% and the previous best visual programming system by 11%. Our transductively learned tools are used 5x more frequently as core program dependency than inductively created ones, demonstrating more effective tool discovery and reuse. The evolved tools also show strong generalization to unseen spatial tasks, achieving superior performance on benchmarks from SpatialScore-Hard collection without any testset-specific modification. Our work establishes experience-driven transductive tool creation as a powerful paradigm for building self-evolving visual programming agents that effectively tackle challenging spatial reasoning tasks.
