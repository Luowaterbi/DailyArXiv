| **[Residual Diffusion Models for Variable-Rate Joint Source Channel Coding of MIMO CSI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21681v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite significant advancements in deep learning based CSI compression, some key limitations remain unaddressed. Current approaches predominantly treat CSI compression as a source-coding problem, thereby neglecting transmission errors. Conventional separate source and channel coding suffers from the cliff effect, leading to significant deterioration in reconstruction performance under challenging channel conditions. While existing autoencoder-based compression schemes can be readily extended to support joint source-channel coding, they struggle to capture complex channel distributions and exhibit poor scalability with increasing parameter count. To overcome these inherent limitations of autoencoder-based approaches, we propose Residual-Diffusion Joint Source-Channel Coding (RD- JSCC), a novel framework that integrates a lightweight autoencoder with a residual diffusion module to iteratively refine CSI reconstruction. Our flexible decoding strategy balances computational efficiency and performance by dynamically switching between low-complexity autoencoder decoding and sophisticated diffusion-based refinement based on channel conditions. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that RD-JSCC significantly outperforms existing autoencoder-based approaches in challenging wireless environments. Furthermore, RD-JSCC offers several practical features, including a low-latency 2-step diffusion during inference, support for multiple compression rates with a single model, robustness to fixed-bit quantization, and adaptability to imperfect channel estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 13 figures, To appear in IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Communications, 2026</p></details> |
| **[FeatBench: Towards More Realistic Evaluation of Feature-level Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22237v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating Large Language Models (LLMs) on repository-level feature implementation is a critical frontier in software engineering. However, establishing a benchmark that faithfully mirrors realistic development scenarios remains a significant challenge. Existing feature-level benchmarks generally suffer from two primary limitations: unrealistic task inputs enriched with code hints and significant data leakage risks due to their static nature. To address these limitations, we propose a new benchmark - FeatBench, which introduces the following advances: (1) Realistic Task Inputs. Task inputs consist solely of natural language requirements, strictly devoid of code hints (e.g., function signatures). This format mirrors realistic software development by requiring agents to independently bridge the gap between abstract user intent and concrete code changes. (2) Evolving Data. FeatBench employs a fully automated pipeline to construct new benchmark versions from the latest repositories, effectively mitigating data contamination. The initial release comprises 157 tasks sourced from 27 actively maintained repositories. We evaluate two state-of-the-art agent frameworks with four leading LLMs on FeatBench. The results reveal that FeatBench poses a significant challenge, with the highest resolved rate reaching only 29.94%. Crucially, our analysis uncovers a prevalent behavioral pattern of aggressive implementation, which leads to "scope creep" and widespread regressions where agents break existing features by diverging from the user's explicit intent. We release FeatBench, our automated pipeline, and all experimental results to facilitate further community research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comment Traps: How Defective Commented-out Code Augment Defects in AI-Assisted Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.20334v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid development of large language models in code generation, AI-powered editors such as GitHub Copilot and Cursor are revolutionizing software development practices. At the same time, studies have identified potential defects in the generated code. Previous research has predominantly examined how code context influences the generation of defective code, often overlooking the impact of defects within commented-out code (CO code). AI coding assistants' interpretation of CO code in prompts affects the code they generate. This study evaluates how AI coding assistants, GitHub Copilot and Cursor, are influenced by defective CO code. The experimental results show that defective CO code in the context causes AI coding assistants to generate more defective code, reaching up to 58.17 percent. Our findings further demonstrate that the tools do not simply copy the defective code from the context. Instead, they actively reason to complete incomplete defect patterns and continue to produce defective code despite distractions such as incorrect indentation or tags. Even with explicit instructions to ignore the defective CO code, the reduction in defects does not exceed 21.84 percent. These findings underscore the need for improved robustness and security measures in AI coding assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the The ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE) (FSE 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Bounds and Constructions of Codes for Ordered Composite DNA Sequences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16406v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper extends the foundational work of Dollma \emph{et al}. on codes for ordered composite DNA sequences. We consider the general setting with an alphabet of size $q$ and a resolution parameter $k$, moving beyond the binary ($q=2$) case primarily studied previously. We investigate error-correcting codes for substitution errors and deletion errors under several channel models, including $(e_1,\ldots,e_k)$-composite error/deletion, $e$-composite error/deletion, and the newly introduced $t$-$(e_1,\ldots,e_t)$-composite error/deletion model. We first establish equivalence relations among families of composite-error correcting codes (CECCs) and among families of composite-deletion correcting codes (CDCCs). This significantly reduces the number of distinct error-parameter sets that require separate analysis. We then derive novel and general upper bounds on the sizes of CECCs using refined sphere-packing arguments and probabilistic methods. These bounds together cover all values of parameters $q$, $k$, $(e_1,\ldots,e_k)$ and $e$. In contrast, previous bounds were only established for $q=2$ and limited choices of $k$, $(e_1,\ldots,e_k)$ and $e$. For CDCCs, we generalize a known non-asymptotic upper bound for $(1,0,\ldots,0)$-CDCCs and then provide a cleaner asymptotic bound. On the constructive side, for any $q\ge2$, we propose $(1,0,\ldots,0)$-CDCCs, $1$-CDCCs and $t$-$(1,\ldots,1)$-CDCCs with near-optimal redundancies. These codes have efficient and systematic encoders. For substitution errors, we design the first explicit encoding and decoding algorithms for the binary $(1,0,\ldots,0)$-CECC constructed by Dollma \emph{et al}, and extend the approach to general $q$. Furthermore, we give an improved construction of binary $1$-CECCs, a construction of nonbinary $1$-CECCs, and a construction of $t$-$(1,\ldots,1)$-CECCs. These constructions are also systematic.</p></details> | submitted |
| **[Fermion-to-Fermion Low-Density Parity-Check Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15323v4)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating fermionic systems on qubit-based quantum computers often demands significant computational resources due to the requirement to map fermions to qubits. Thus, designing a fault-tolerant quantum computer that operates directly with fermions offers an effective solution to this challenge. Here, we introduce a protocol for fault-tolerant fermionic quantum computation utilizing fermion-to-fermion low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Our method employs a fermionic LDPC memory, which transfers its state to fermionic color code processors, where logical operations are subsequently performed. We propose using odd-weight logical Majorana operators to form the code space, serving as memory for the fermionic LDPC code, and provide an algorithm to identify these logical operators. We present examples showing that the encoding rate of fermionic codes often matches that of qubit codes, while the logical failure rate can be significantly lower than the physical error rate. Furthermore, we propose two methods for performing fermionic lattice surgery to facilitate state transfer. Finally, we simulate the dynamics of a fermionic system using our protocol, illustrating effective error suppression.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages (including end matter and supplemental material), 18 figures.

| **[Cryptographic Applications of Twisted Goppa Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16207v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article defines multi-twisted Goppa (MTG) codes as subfield subcodes of duals of multi-twisted Reed-Solomon (MTRS) codes and examines their properties. We show that if $t$ is the degree of the MTG polynomial defining an MTG code, its minimum distance is at least $t + 1$ under certain conditions. Extending earlier methods limited to single twist at last position, we use the extended Euclidean algorithm to efficiently decode MTG codes with a single twist at any position, correcting up to $\left\lfloor \tfrac{t}{2} \right\rfloor$ errors. This decoding method highlights the practical potential of these codes within the Niederreiter public key cryptosystem (PKC). Furthermore, we establish that the Niederreiter PKC based on MTG codes is secure against partial key recovery attacks. Additionally, we also reduce the public key size by constructing quasi-cyclic MTG codes using a non-trivial automorphism group.</p></details> |  |
| **[Diffusion Codes: Self-Correction from Small(er)-Set Expansion with Tunable Non-locality](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07179v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal constructions of classical LDPC codes can be obtained by choosing the Tanner graph uniformly at random among biregular graphs. We introduce a class of codes that we call ``diffusion codes'', defined by placing each edge connecting bits and checks on some graph, and acting on that graph with a random SWAP network. By tuning the depth of the SWAP network, we can tune a tradeoff between the amount of randomness -- and hence the optimality of code parameters -- and locality with respect to the underlying graph. For diffusion codes defined on the cycle graph, if the SWAP network has depth $\sim Tn$ with $T> n^{2β}$ for arbitrary $β>0$, then we prove that almost surely the Tanner graph is a lossless ``smaller set'' vertex expander for small sets up size $δ\sim \sqrt T \sim n^β$, with bounded bit and check degree. At the same time, the geometric size of the largest stabilizer is bounded by $\sqrt T$ in graph distance. We argue, based on physical intuition, that this result should hold more generally on arbitrary graphs. By taking hypergraph products of these classical codes we obtain quantum LDPC codes defined on the torus with smaller-set boundary and co-boundary expansion and the same expansion/locality tradeoffs as for the classical codes. These codes are self-correcting and admit single-shot decoding, while having the geometric size of the stabilizer growing as an arbitrarily small power law. Our proof technique establishes mixing of a random SWAP network on small subsystems at times scaling with only the subsystem size, which may be of independent interest.</p></details> | 48 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Lossy Source Coding with Broadcast Side Information](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07797v2)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper considers the source coding problem with broadcast side information. The side information is sent to two receivers through a noisy broadcast channel. We provide an outer bound of the rate--distortion--bandwidth (RDB) quadruples and achievable RDB quadruples when the helper uses a separation-based scheme. Some special cases with full characterization are also provided. We then compare the separation-based scheme with the uncoded scheme in the quadratic Gaussian case.</p></details> |  |
| **[Algorithm-Based Pipeline for Reliable and Intent-Preserving Code Translation with LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16106v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation, the automatic conversion of programs between languages, is a growing use case for Large Language Models (LLMs). However, direct one-shot translation often fails to preserve program intent, leading to errors in control flow, type handling, and I/O behavior. We propose an algorithm-based pipeline that introduces a language-neutral intermediate specification to capture these details before code generation. This study empirically evaluates the extent to which structured planning can improve translation accuracy and reliability relative to direct translation. We conduct an automated paired experiment - direct and algorithm-based to translate between Python and Java using five widely used LLMs on the Avatar and CodeNet datasets. For each combination (model, dataset, approach, and direction), we compile and execute the translated program and run the tests provided. We record compilation results, runtime behavior, timeouts (e.g., infinite loop), and test outcomes. We compute accuracy from these tests, counting a translation as correct only if it compiles, runs without exceptions or timeouts, and passes all tests. We then map every failed compile-time and runtime case to a unified, language-aware taxonomy and compare subtype frequencies between the direct and algorithm-based approaches. Overall, the Algorithm-based approach increases micro-average accuracy from 67.7% to 78.5% (10.8% increase). It eliminates lexical and token errors by 100%, reduces incomplete constructs by 72.7%, and structural and declaration issues by 61.1%. It also substantially lowers runtime dependency and entry-point failures by 78.4%. These results demonstrate that algorithm-based pipelines enable more reliable, intent-preserving code translation, providing a foundation for robust multilingual programming assistants.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 34th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Strong Singleton-Like Bounds, Quasi-Perfect Codes and Distance-Optimal Codes in the Sum-Rank Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.05581v3)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Codes in the sum-rank metric have received many attentions in recent years, since they have wide applications in the multishot network coding, the space-time coding and the distributed storage. In this paper, by constructing covering codes in the sum-rank metric from covering codes in the Hamming metric, we derive new upper bounds on sizes, the covering radii and the block length functions of codes in the sum-rank metric. As applications, we present several strong Singleton-like bounds that are tighter than the classical Singleton-like bound when block lengths are large. In addition, we give the explicit constructions of the distance-optimal sum-rank codes of matrix sizes $s\times s$ and $2\times 2$ with minimum sum-rank distance four respectively by using cyclic codes in the Hamming metric. More importantly, we present an infinite families of quasi-perfect $q$-ary sum-rank codes with matrix sizes $2\times m$. Furthermore, we construct almost MSRD codes with larger block lengths and demonstrate how the Plotkin sum can be used to give more distance-optimal sum-rank codes.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Secure Coding with AI -- From Detection to Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20814v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While several studies have examined the security of code generated by GPT and other Large Language Models (LLMs), most have relied on controlled experiments rather than real developer interactions. This paper investigates the security of GPT-generated code extracted from the DevGPT dataset and evaluates the ability of current LLMs to detect and repair vulnerabilities in this real-world context. We analysed 2,315 C, C++, and C# code snippets using static scanners combined with manual inspection, identifying 56 vulnerabilities across 48 files. These files were then assessed using GPT-4.1, GPT-5, and Claude Opus 4.1 to determine whether these could identify the security issues and, where applicable, to specify the corresponding Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) numbers and propose fixes. Manual review and re-scanning of the modified code showed that GPT-4.1, GPT-5, and Claude Opus 4.1 correctly detected 46, 44, and 45 vulnerabilities, and successfully repaired 42, 44, and 43 respectively. A comparison of experiments conducted in October 2024 and September 2025 indicates substantial progress, with overall detection and remediation rates improving from roughly 50 % to around 75 - 80 %. We also observe that LLM-generated code is about as likely to contain vulnerabilities as developer-written code, and that LLMs may confidently provide incorrect information, posing risks for less experienced developers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Not All Tokens Matter: Data-Centric Optimization for Efficient Code Summarization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.20147v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-tuned Language Models ILMs have become essential components of modern AI systems, demonstrating exceptional versatility across a wide range of natural language and reasoning tasks. Among their most impactful applications is code generation, where ILMs--commonly referred to as Code Language Models CLMs--have demonstrated remarkable capability. This strength stems from their defining feature: the use of explicit task instructions during fine-tuning, which enables them to bridge natural language and code by translating human intent into executable code. While much of their progress has been driven by advances in scaling laws and training methodologies, one critical aspect remains underexplored--the impact of system prompts on the performance of both general-purpose ILMs and specialized CLMs when instantiated to assist users with code generation activities. In this study, we take a first step toward bridging this gap by systematically evaluating how system prompts of varying instructional detail, along with model scale, prompting strategy, and programming language, affect ILMs and CLMs in code generation tasks. Our evaluation framework, spanning 120 model configurations, reveals that (1) the influence of system prompts increases with model scale; (2) few-shot prompting reduces this effect compared to zero-shot; and (3) programming language matters, with Java showing greater sensitivity to system prompt variations than Python.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Tool Orchestration to Code Execution: A Study of MCP Design Choices](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15945v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model Context Protocols (MCPs) provide a unified platform for agent systems to discover, select, and orchestrate tools across heterogeneous execution environments. As MCP-based systems scale to incorporate larger tool catalogs and multiple concurrently connected MCP servers, traditional tool-by-tool invocation increases coordination overhead, fragments state management, and limits support for wide-context operations. To address these scalability challenges, recent MCP designs have incorporated code execution as a first-class capability, an approach called Code Execution MCP (CE-MCP). This enables agents to consolidate complex workflows, such as SQL querying, file analysis, and multi-step data transformations, into a single program that executes within an isolated runtime environment. In this work, we formalize the architectural distinction between context-coupled (traditional) and context-decoupled (CE-MCP) models, analyzing their fundamental scalability trade-offs. Using the MCP-Bench framework across 10 representative servers, we empirically evaluate task behavior, tool utilization patterns, execution latency, and protocol efficiency as the scale of connected MCP servers and available tools increases, demonstrating that while CE-MCP significantly reduces token usage and execution latency, it introduces a vastly expanded attack surface. We address this security gap by applying the MAESTRO framework, identifying sixteen attack classes across five execution phases-including specific code execution threats such as exception-mediated code injection and unsafe capability synthesis. We validate these vulnerabilities through adversarial scenarios across multiple LLMs and propose a layered defense architecture comprising containerized sandboxing and semantic gating. Our findings provide a rigorous roadmap for balancing scalability and security in production-ready executable agent workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[GLM-5: from Vibe Coding to Agentic Engineering](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15763v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GLM-5, a next-generation foundation model designed to transition the paradigm of vibe coding to agentic engineering. Building upon the agentic, reasoning, and coding (ARC) capabilities of its predecessor, GLM-5 adopts DSA to significantly reduce training and inference costs while maintaining long-context fidelity. To advance model alignment and autonomy, we implement a new asynchronous reinforcement learning infrastructure that drastically improves post-training efficiency by decoupling generation from training. Furthermore, we propose novel asynchronous agent RL algorithms that further improve RL quality, enabling the model to learn from complex, long-horizon interactions more effectively. Through these innovations, GLM-5 achieves state-of-the-art performance on major open benchmarks. Most critically, GLM-5 demonstrates unprecedented capability in real-world coding tasks, surpassing previous baselines in handling end-to-end software engineering challenges. Code, models, and more information are available at https://github.com/zai-org/GLM-5.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Differential Fuzzing-Based Evaluation of Functional Equivalence in LLM-Generated Code Refactorings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15761v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid adoption of large language models (LLMs) in automated code refactoring, assessing and ensuring functional equivalence between LLM-generated refactoring and the original implementation becomes critical. While prior work typically relies on predefined test cases to evaluate correctness, in this work, we leverage differential fuzzing to check functional equivalence in LLM-generated code refactorings. Unlike test-based evaluation, a differential fuzzing-based equivalence checker needs no predefined test cases and can explore a much larger input space by executing and comparing thousands of automatically generated test inputs. In a large-scale evaluation of six LLMs (CodeLlama, Codestral, StarChat2, Qwen-2.5, Olmo-3, and GPT-4o) across three datasets and two refactoring types, we find that LLMs show a non-trivial tendency to alter program semantics, producing 19-35% functionally non-equivalent refactorings. Our experiments further demonstrate that about 21% of these non-equivalent refactorings remain undetected by the existing test suites of the three evaluated datasets. Collectively, the findings of this study imply that reliance on existing tests might overestimate functional equivalence in LLM-generated code refactorings, which remain prone to semantic divergence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Syndrome-Flow Consistency Model Achieves One-step Denoising Error Correction Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01389v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Error Correction Codes (ECC) are fundamental to reliable digital communication, yet designing neural decoders that are both accurate and computationally efficient remains challenging. Recent denoising diffusion decoders achieve state-of-the-art performance, but their iterative sampling limits practicality in low-latency settings. To bridge this gap, consistency models (CMs) offer a potential path to high-fidelity one-step decoding. However, applying CMs to ECC presents a significant challenge: the discrete nature of error correction means the decoding trajectory is highly non-smooth, making it incompatible with a simple continuous timestep parameterization. To address this, we re-parameterize the reverse Probability Flow Ordinary Differential Equation (PF-ODE) by soft-syndrome condition, providing a smooth trajectory of signal corruption. Building on this, we propose the Error Correction Syndrome-Flow Consistency Model (ECCFM), a model-agnostic framework designed specifically for ECC task, ensuring the model learns a smooth trajectory from any noisy signal directly to the original codeword in a single step. Across multiple benchmarks, ECCFM attains lower bit-error-rate (BER) and frame-error-rate (FER) than transformer-based decoders, while delivering inference speeds 30x to 100x faster than iterative denoising diffusion decoders.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Constructions of Reed-Solomon Codes with Optimal Repair Bandwidth](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.10685v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Maximum-distance-separable (MDS) codes are widely used in distributed storage, yet naive repair of a single erasure in an $[n,k]$ MDS code downloads the entire contents of $k$ nodes. Minimum Storage Regenerating (MSR) codes (Dimakis et al., 2010) minimize repair bandwidth by contacting $d>k$ helpers and downloading only a fraction of data from each. Guruswami and Wootters first proposed a linear repair scheme for Reed-Solomon (RS) codes, showing that they can be repaired with lower bandwidth than the naive approach. The existence of RS codes achieving the MSR point (RS-MSR codes) nevertheless remained open until the breakthrough construction of Tamo, Barg, and Ye, which yields RS-MSR codes with subpacketization $\ell = s \prod_{i=1}^n p_i$, where $p_i$ are distinct primes satisfying $p_i \equiv 1 \pmod{s}$ and $s=d+1-k$. In this paper, we present an improved construction of RS-MSR codes by eliminating the congruence condition $p_i \equiv 1 \pmod{s}$. Consequently, our construction reduces the subpacketization by a multiplicative factor of $φ(s)^n$ ( $φ(\cdot)$ is Euler's totient function) and broadens the range of feasible parameters for RS-MSR codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Code Smell Refactoring Approach using GNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.12069v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code smell is a great challenge in software refactoring, which indicates latent design or implementation flaws that may degrade the software maintainability and evolution. Over the past decades, a variety of refactoring approaches have been proposed, which can be broadly classified into metrics-based, rule-based, and machine learning-based approaches. Recent years, deep learning-based approaches have also attracted widespread attention. However, existing techniques exhibit various limitations. Metrics- and rule-based approaches rely heavily on manually defined heuristics and thresholds, whereas deep learning-based approaches are often constrained by dataset availability and model design. In this study, we proposed a graph-based deep learning approach for code smell refactoring. Specifically, we designed two types of input graphs (class-level and method-level) and employed both graph classification and node classification tasks to address the refactoring of three representative code smells: long method, large class, and feature envy. In our experiment, we propose a semi-automated dataset generation approach that could generate a large-scale dataset with minimal manual effort. We implemented the proposed approach with three classical GNN (graph neural network) architectures: GCN, GraphSAGE, and GAT, and evaluated its performance against both traditional and state-of-the-art deep learning approaches. The results demonstrate that proposed approach achieves superior refactoring performance.</p></details> |  |

We analyze a concatenated coding scheme, where the outer code is designed to handle the random sampling, while the inner code is designed to handle the random sequencing noise. We assume that the sequencing channel is symmetric and choose the inner coding scheme to be composed by a linear block code and a zero-undetected-error decoder. As a byproduct, the resulting optimal maximum-likelihood decoder land itself for an amenable analysis, and we are able to derive an achievability bound for the scaling of the number of information bits that can be reliably stored. As a result of independent interest, we prove that the average error probability of random linear block codes under zero-undetected-error decoding converges to zero exponentially fast with the block length, as long as its coding rate does not exceed some critical value, which is known to serve as a lower bound to the zero-undetected-error capacity.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2511.14284.

| **[Accelerated Predictive Coding Networks via Direct Kolen-Pollack Feedback Alignment](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15571v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive coding (PC) is a biologically inspired algorithm for training neural networks that relies only on local updates, allowing parallel learning across layers. However, practical implementations face two key limitations: error signals must still propagate from the output to early layers through multiple inference-phase steps, and feedback decays exponentially during this process, leading to vanishing updates in early layers. We propose direct Kolen-Pollack predictive coding (DKP-PC), which simultaneously addresses both feedback delay and exponential decay, yielding a more efficient and scalable variant of PC while preserving update locality. Leveraging direct feedback alignment and direct Kolen-Pollack algorithms, DKP-PC introduces learnable feedback connections from the output layer to all hidden layers, establishing a direct pathway for error transmission. This yields an algorithm that reduces the theoretical error propagation time complexity from O(L), with L being the network depth, to O(1), removing depth-dependent delay in error signals. Moreover, empirical results demonstrate that DKP-PC achieves performance at least comparable to, and often exceeding, that of standard PC, while offering improved latency and computational performance, supporting its potential for custom hardware-efficient implementations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Large Language Models for Secure Code Assessment: A Multi-Language Empirical Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06428v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most vulnerability detection studies focus on datasets of vulnerabilities in C/C++ code, offering limited language diversity. Thus, the effectiveness of deep learning methods, including large language models (LLMs), in detecting software vulnerabilities beyond these languages is still largely unexplored. In this paper, we evaluate the effectiveness of LLMs in detecting and classifying Common Weakness Enumerations (CWE) using different prompt and role strategies. Our experimental study targets six state-of-the-art pre-trained LLMs (GPT-3.5- Turbo, GPT-4 Turbo, GPT-4o, CodeLLama-7B, CodeLLama- 13B, and Gemini 1.5 Pro) and five programming languages: Python, C, C++, Java, and JavaScript. We compiled a multi-language vulnerability dataset from different sources, to ensure representativeness. Our results showed that GPT-4o achieves the highest vulnerability detection and CWE classification scores using a few-shot setting. Aside from the quantitative results of our study, we developed a library called CODEGUARDIAN integrated with VSCode which enables developers to perform LLM-assisted real-time vulnerability analysis in real-world security scenarios. We have evaluated CODEGUARDIAN with a user study involving 22 developers from the industry. Our study showed that, by using CODEGUARDIAN, developers are more accurate and faster at detecting vulnerabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 7th International Workshop on Deep Learning for Testing and Testing for Deep Learning (DeepTest 2026), co-located with ICSE 2026</p></details> |
| **[TAROT: Test-driven and Capability-adaptive Curriculum Reinforcement Fine-tuning for Code Generation with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15449v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are changing the coding paradigm, known as vibe coding, yet synthesizing algorithmically sophisticated and robust code still remains a critical challenge. Incentivizing the deep reasoning capabilities of LLMs is essential to overcoming this hurdle. Reinforcement Fine-Tuning (RFT) has emerged as a promising strategy to address this need. However, most existing approaches overlook the heterogeneous difficulty and granularity inherent in test cases, leading to an imbalanced distribution of reward signals and consequently biased gradient updates during training. To address this, we propose Test-driven and cApability-adaptive cuRriculum reinfOrcement fine-Tuning (TAROT). TAROT systematically constructs, for each problem, a four-tier test suite (basic, intermediate, complex, edge), providing a controlled difficulty landscape for curriculum design and evaluation. Crucially, TAROT decouples curriculum progression from raw reward scores, enabling capability-conditioned evaluation and principled selection from a portfolio of curriculum policies rather than incidental test-case difficulty composition. This design fosters stable optimization and more efficient competency acquisition. Extensive experimental results reveal that the optimal curriculum for RFT in code generation is closely tied to a model's inherent capability, with less capable models achieving greater gains with an easy-to-hard progression, whereas more competent models excel under a hard-first curriculum. TAROT provides a reproducible method that adaptively tailors curriculum design to a model's capability, thereby consistently improving the functional correctness and robustness of the generated code.

To better understand the underlying dynamics of codebase evolution, we introduce a novel approach that integrates semantic code embeddings with opinion dynamics theory, offering a quantitative framework to analyze collaborative development processes. Our approach begins by encoding code snippets into high-dimensional vector representations using state-of-the-art code embedding models, preserving both syntactic and semantic features. These embeddings are then processed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, with data normalized to ensure comparability. We model temporal evolution using the Expressed-Private Opinion (EPO) model to derive trust matrices and track opinion trajectories across development cycles. These opinion trajectories reflect the underlying dynamics of consensus formation, influence propagation, and evolving alignment (or divergence) within developer communities -- revealing implicit collaboration patterns and knowledge-sharing mechanisms that are otherwise difficult to observe. By bridging software engineering and computational social science, our method provides a principled way to quantify software evolution, offering new insights into developer influence, consensus formation, and project sustainability. We evaluate our approach on data from three prominent open-source GitHub repositories, demonstrating its ability to reveal interpretable behavioral trends and variations in developer interactions. The results highlight the utility of our framework in improving open-source project maintenance through data-driven analysis of collaboration dynamics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is currently under review at Journal of Computational Science.

| **[Toward Agentic Software Engineering Beyond Code: Framing Vision, Values, and Vocabulary](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19692v2)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic AI is poised to usher in a seismic paradigm shift in Software Engineering (SE). As technologists rush head-along to make agentic AI a reality, SE researchers are driven to establish agentic SE as a research area. While early visions of agentic SE are primarily focused on code-related activities, early empirical evidence calls for a consideration of a wider range of socio-technical activities and concerns to make it work in practice. This paper contributes to the emerging visions by: (a) recommending an expansion of its scope beyond code, toward a 'whole of process' vision, grounding it in SE foundations and evolution and emerging agentic SE frameworks, (b) proposing a preliminary set of values and principles to guide community efforts, and (c) sharing guidance on designing and using well-defined vocabulary for agentic SE. It is hoped that these ideas will encourage collaborations and steer the SE community toward laying strong foundations of agentic SE so it is not limited to enabling coding acceleration but becomes the next process-level paradigm shift.</p></details> | 5 pages |

However, implementing logical operations using qLDPC codes presents significant challenges. Previous research has demonstrated that self-dual qLDPC codes facilitate the implementation of transversal Clifford gates. Here we introduce a method for constructing self-dual qLDPC codes by stacking non-self-dual qLDPC codes. Leveraging this methodology, we develop double-chain bicycle codes, double-layer bivariate bicycle (BB) codes, double-layer twisted BB codes, and double-layer reflection codes, many of which exhibit favorable code parameters. Additionally, we conduct numerical calculations to assess the performance of these codes as quantum memory under the circuit-level noise model, revealing that the logical failure rate can be significantly reduced with high pseudo-thresholds.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables (including end matter)</p></details> |

Over the past of decades, the research on code smell has received extensive attention. Especially the researches applied machine learning-technique have become a popular topic in recent studies. However, one of the biggest challenges to apply machine learning-technique is the lack of high-quality code smell datasets. Manually constructing such datasets is extremely labor-intensive, as identifying code smells requires substantial development expertise and considerable time investment. In contrast, automatically generated datasets, while scalable, frequently exhibit reduced label reliability and compromised data quality. To overcome this challenge, in this study, we explore a semi-automatic approach to generate a code smell dataset with high quality data samples. Specifically, we first applied a set of automatic generation rules to produce candidate smelly samples. We then employed multiple metrics to group the data samples into an automatically accepted group and a manually reviewed group, enabling reviewers to concentrate their efforts on ambiguous samples. Furthermore, we established structured review guidelines and developed a annotation tool to support the manual validation process. Based on the proposed semi-automatic generation approach, we created an open-source code smell dataset, SACS, covering three widely studied code smells: Long Method, Large Class, and Feature Envy. Each code smell category includes over 10,000 labeled samples. This dataset could provide a large-scale and publicly available benchmark to facilitate future studies on code smell detection and automated refactoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2511.12069</p></details> |
| **[On Function-Correcting Codes in the Lee Metric](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17654v3)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function-correcting codes are a coding framework designed to minimize redundancy while ensuring that specific functions or computations of encoded data can be reliably recovered, even in the presence of errors. The choice of metric is crucial in designing such codes, as it determines which computations must be protected and how errors are measured and corrected. Previous work by Liu and Liu [6] studied function-correcting codes over $\mathbb{Z}_{2^l},\ l\geq 2$ using the homogeneous metric, which coincides with the Lee metric over $\mathbb{Z}_4$. In this paper, we extend the study to codes over $\mathbb{Z}_m,$ for any positive integer $m\geq 2$ under the Lee metric and aim to determine their optimal redundancy. To achieve this, we introduce irregular Lee distance codes and derive upper and lower bounds on the optimal redundancy by characterizing the shortest possible length of such codes. These general bounds are then simplified and applied to specific classes of functions, including locally bounded functions, Lee weight functions, and Lee weight distribution functions. We extend the bounds established by Liu and Liu [6] for codes over $\mathbb{Z}_4$ in the Lee metric to the more general setting of $\mathbb{Z}_m$. Moreover, we give explicit constructions of function-correcting codes in Lee metric. Additionally, we explicitly derive a Plotkin-like bound for linear function-correcting codes in the Lee metric. As the Lee metric coincides with the Hamming metric over the binary field, we demonstrate that our bound naturally reduces to a Plotkin-type bound for function-correcting codes under the Hamming metric over $\mathbb{Z}_2$.</p></details> |  |
| **[AgriWorld:A World Tools Protocol Framework for Verifiable Agricultural Reasoning with Code-Executing LLM Agents](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15325v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Foundation models for agriculture are increasingly trained on massive spatiotemporal data (e.g., multi-spectral remote sensing, soil grids, and field-level management logs) and achieve strong performance on forecasting and monitoring. However, these models lack language-based reasoning and interactive capabilities, limiting their usefulness in real-world agronomic workflows. Meanwhile, large language models (LLMs) excel at interpreting and generating text, but cannot directly reason over high-dimensional, heterogeneous agricultural datasets. We bridge this gap with an agentic framework for agricultural science. It provides a Python execution environment, AgriWorld, exposing unified tools for geospatial queries over field parcels, remote-sensing time-series analytics, crop growth simulation, and task-specific predictors (e.g., yield, stress, and disease risk). On top of this environment, we design a multi-turn LLM agent, Agro-Reflective, that iteratively writes code, observes execution results, and refines its analysis via an execute-observe-refine loop. We introduce AgroBench, with scalable data generation for diverse agricultural QA spanning lookups, forecasting, anomaly detection, and counterfactual "what-if" analysis. Experiments outperform text-only and direct tool-use baselines, validating execution-driven reflection for reliable agricultural reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Vibe Coding Safe? Benchmarking Vulnerability of Agent-Generated Code in Real-World Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03262v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vibe coding is a new programming paradigm in which human engineers instruct large language model (LLM) agents to complete complex coding tasks with little supervision. Although vibe coding is increasingly adopted, are its outputs really safe to deploy in production? To answer this question, we propose SU S VI B E S, a benchmark consisting of 200 feature-request software engineering tasks from real-world open-source projects, which, when given to human programmers, led to vulnerable implementations. We evaluate multiple widely used coding agents with frontier models on this benchmark. Disturbingly, all agents perform poorly in terms of software security. Although 61% of the solutions from SWE-Agent with Claude 4 Sonnet are functionally correct, only 10.5% are secure. Further experiments demonstrate that preliminary security strategies, such as augmenting the feature request with vulnerability hints, cannot mitigate these security issues. Our findings raise serious concerns about the widespread adoption of vibe-coding, particularly in security-sensitive applications.</p></details> |  |

Among their most impactful applications is code generation, where ILMs -- commonly referred to as Code Language Models (CLMs) -- translate human intent into executable programs. While progress has been driven by advances in scaling and training methodologies, one critical aspect remains underexplored: the impact of system prompts on both general-purpose ILMs and specialized CLMs for code generation. We systematically evaluate how system prompts of varying instructional detail, along with model scale, prompting strategy, and programming language, affect code assistant. Our experimental setting spans 360 configurations across four models, five system prompts, three prompting strategies, two languages, and two temperature settings. We find that (1) increasing system-prompt constraint specificity does not monotonically improve correctness -- prompt effectiveness is configuration-dependent and can help or hinder based on alignment with task requirements and decoding context; (2) for larger code-specialized models, few-shot examples can degrade performance relative to zero-shot generation, contrary to conventional wisdom; and (3) programming language matters, with Java exhibiting significantly greater sensitivity to system prompt variations than Python, suggesting language-specific prompt engineering strategies may be necessary.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 12 tables, 3 figures</p></details> |

In 2023, Xu et al. introduced a construction framework for 3-dimensional linear codes parameterized by two functions, which has demonstrated considerable success in generating infinite families of optimal linear codes. Motivated by this approach, we propose a construction that extends the framework to three functions, thereby enhancing the flexibility of the parameters. Additionally, we introduce a vectorial setting by allowing vector-valued functions, expanding the construction space and the set of achievable structural properties. We analyze both scalar and vectorial frameworks, employing Bent and s-Plateaued functions, including Almost Bent, to define the code generators. By exploiting the properties of the Walsh transform, we determine the explicit parameters and weight distributions of these codes and their punctured versions. A key result of this study is that the constructed codes have few weights, and their duals are distance and dimensionally optimal with respect to both the Sphere Packing and Griesmer bounds. Furthermore, we establish a theoretical connection between our vectorial approach and the classical first generic construction of linear codes, providing sufficient conditions for the resulting codes to be minimal and self-orthogonal. Finally, we investigate applications to quantum coding theory within the Calderbank-Shor-Steane framework.</p></details> | 27 pages |
| **[Learning State-Tracking from Code Using Linear RNNs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14814v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Over the last years, state-tracking tasks, particularly permutation composition, have become a testbed to understand the limits of sequence models architectures like Transformers and RNNs (linear and non-linear). However, these are often sequence-to-sequence tasks: learning to map actions (permutations) to states, which is incompatible with the next-token prediction setting commonly used to train language models. We address this gap by converting permutation composition into code via REPL traces that interleave state-reveals through prints and variable transformations. We show that linear RNNs capable of state-tracking excel also in this setting, while Transformers still fail. Motivated by this representation, we investigate why tracking states in code is generally difficult: actions are not always fully observable. We frame this as tracking the state of a probabilistic finite-state automaton with deterministic state reveals and show that linear RNNs can be worse than non-linear RNNs at tracking states in this setup.</p></details> |  |

Developers can configure these tools through versioned repository-level artifacts such as Markdown and JSON files. In this paper, we present a systematic analysis of configuration mechanisms for agentic AI coding tools, covering Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, Cursor, Gemini, and Codex. We identify eight configuration mechanisms and, in an empirical study of 2,926 GitHub repositories, examine whether and how they are adopted. We then explore Context Files, Skills, and Subagents, that is, three mechanisms available across tools, in more detail. Our findings reveal three trends. First, Context Files dominate the configuration landscape and are often the sole mechanism in a repository, with AGENTS$.$md emerging as an interoperable standard across tools. Second, advanced mechanisms such as Skills and Subagents are only shallowly adopted: most repositories define only one or two artifacts, and Skills predominantly rely on static instructions rather than executable workflows. Third, distinct configuration cultures are forming around different tools, with Claude Code users employing the broadest range of mechanisms. These findings establish an empirical baseline for longitudinal and experimental research on how configuration strategies evolve and affect agent performance as agentic AI coding tools mature.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 7 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |
| **[Consistent or Sensitive? Automated Code Revision Tools Against Semantics-Preserving Perturbations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14595v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Code Revision (ACR) tools aim to reduce manual effort by automatically generating code revisions based on reviewer feedback. While ACR tools have shown promising performance on historical data, their real-world utility depends on their ability to handle similar code variants expressing the same issue - a property we define as consistency. However, the probabilistic nature of ACR tools often compromises consistency, which may lead to divergent revisions even for semantically equivalent code variants. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which ACR tools maintain consistency when presented with semantically equivalent code variants. To do so, we first designed nine types of semantics-preserving perturbations (SPP) and applied them to 2032 Java methods from real-world GitHub projects, generating over 10K perturbed variants for evaluation. Then we used these perturbations to evaluate the consistency of five state-of-the-art transformer-based ACR tools. We found that the ACR tools' ability to generate correct revisions can drop by up to 45.3%, when presented with semantically equivalent code. The closer the perturbation is to this targeted region, the more likely an ACR tool is to fail to generate the correct revision. We explored potential mitigation strategies that modify the input representation, but found that these attention-guiding heuristics yielded only marginal improvements, thus leaving the solution to this problem as an open research question.</p></details> |  |

The method consists of two steps: clustering of metric vectors computed for each code change, followed by expert mapping of the resulting clusters to predefined change classes. The distribution of changes into clusters is performed automatically, while the mapping of clusters to classes is carried out by an expert. Automation of the distribution step substantially reduces the time required for code change review. The k-means algorithm with a cosine similarity measure between metric vectors is used for clustering. Eleven source code metrics are employed, covering lines of code, cyclomatic complexity, file counts, interface changes, and structural changes. The method was validated on five software systems, including two open-source projects (Subversion and NHibernate), and demonstrated classification purity of P_C = 0.75 +/- 0.05 and entropy of E_C = 0.37 +/- 0.06 at a significance level of 0.05.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an English translation of the author's Ph.D. dissertation abstract, originally defended in Russian at ITMO University (2009) under the supervision of Prof. A.A.

| **[The Influence of Code Smells in Efferent Neighbors on Class Stability](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12950v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding what drives code instability is essential for effective software maintenance, as unstable classes require larger or more frequent edits and increase the risk of unintended side effects. Although code smells are widely believed to harm maintainability, most prior stability studies examine only the smells within the class being modified. In practice, however, classes can change because their efferent neighbors (i.e., the classes they depend on) are modified due to ripple effects that propagate along static dependencies, even if the class itself is clean. Such ripple effects may be more severe when the efferent neighbor exhibits code smells. In addition, code smells rarely occur alone. They often appear together within a class or across classes connected by static dependencies, a phenomenon known as code smell interrelation. Such interrelation can lead to code smell interaction, where smells are directly connected through static dependencies and may further compound maintainability issues. However, the effect of code smell interrelation and interaction on code quality remains largely underexplored. Therefore, this study investigates whether the presence of code smells in a class's efferent neighbors affects its stability, considering the factor of code smell interrelation and interaction. To achieve this, we mine one year of commit history from 100 top-starred GitHub projects, detect code smells and static dependencies, determine code smell interrelation and interaction, and model these factors as predictors of class stability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a Registered Report at the International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR) 2026</p></details> |

Our main focus is on the case where the trees are full (regular) and the winning set is open (with respect to the product topology on the tree). Gale and Stewart showed that in this setting one of the players always has a winning strategy, though it is not known in advance which player. We present simple necessary conditions for the first player to have a winning strategy, and establish an equivalence between winning sets that guarantee a win for the first player and maximal prefix codes. Using this equivalence, we derive a necessary algebraic condition for winning, and exhibit a family of games for which this algebraic condition is in fact equivalent to winning. We introduce the concept of coverings, and show that by covering the tree of the game with an infinite labeled tree corresponding to the free group, we can use "game-theoretic tools" to derive a simple trait of maximal prefix codes.</p></details> |  |

This abstraction introduces an under-measured attack surface: skill-based prompt injection, where poisoned skills can steer agents away from user intent and safety policies. In practice, naive injections often fail because the malicious intent is too explicit or drifts too far from the original skill, leading agents to ignore or refuse them; existing attacks are also largely hand-crafted. We propose the first automated framework for stealthy prompt injection tailored to agent skills. The framework forms a closed loop with three agents: an Attack Agent that synthesizes injection skills under explicit stealth constraints, a Code Agent that executes tasks using the injected skills in a realistic tool environment, and an Evaluate Agent that logs action traces (e.g., tool calls and file operations) and verifies whether targeted malicious behaviors occurred. We also propose a malicious payload hiding strategy that conceals adversarial operations in auxiliary scripts while injecting optimized inducement prompts to trigger tool execution. Extensive experiments across diverse coding-agent settings and real-world software engineering tasks show that our method consistently achieves high attack success rates under realistic settings.</p></details> |  |

Moreover, using expander graphs, we construct trellis codes over constant-size alphabets that achieve a rate-distance trade-off arbitrarily close to that of convolutional codes with a maximum distance profile. By comparison, all known constructions of convolutional codes with a maximum distance profile require working over alphabets whose size grows at least exponentially with the number of output symbols per time instant.</p></details> |  |

Existing Test Time Scaling (TTS) methods, including structured tree search, have made progress in exploring reasoning paths but still face two major challenges: (1) underthinking, where reasoning chains tend to be shallow and fail to capture the full complexity of problems; and (2) overthinking, where overly verbose reasoning leads to inefficiency and increased computational costs. To address these issues, we propose LogitsCoder, a novel framework that enhances chain-of-thought reasoning through lightweight, logit-level control mechanisms for code generation. LogitsCoder iteratively generates and refines reasoning steps by first steering token selection toward statistically preferred patterns via Logits Preference Decoding, then selecting and aggregating diverse reasoning paths using Logits Rank Based Path Selection and Thoughts Aggregation. This results in coherent and effective reasoning chains that balance depth and efficiency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LogitsCoder produces more efficient and higher-quality reasoning chains, leading to superior code generation performance compared to baseline methods.</p></details> |  |

This ability to reason about dynamic program behavior is fundamental to effective software engineering and increasingly supported by Large Language Models (LLMs). However, existing studies on code reasoning focus primarily on isolated code snippets, overlooking the complexity of real-world scenarios involving external API interactions and unfamiliar functions. This gap hinders our understanding of what truly makes code reasoning challenging for LLMs across diverse programming contexts. We present CodeGlance, a multi-dimensional benchmark investigating code reasoning challenges across three realistic scenarios: intrinsic logic reasoning, API interaction reasoning, and unseen function reasoning. Through systematic evaluation of 7 state-of-the-art LLMs, we reveal that unseen function reasoning poses significant challenges especially for smaller models, with Qwen2.5-3b achieving only 6.0\% accuracy on unseen functions compared to 37.5\% on familiar APIs. We identify critical code complexity features -- including execution trace length, API invocation count, and control flow complexity -- that significantly impact code reasoning difficulty across scenarios. We further investigate how common augmentation strategies, including CoT, document retrieval, and code search, can improve reasoning performance, finding that their effectiveness varies substantially depending on whether challenges stem from logical complexity or knowledge gaps. These findings provide actionable guidance for developing more capable code reasoning systems and deploying LLM-based programming assistants in real-world software development.</p></details> |  |

For many years, our community searched for faster and more stable optimizers with only constrained positive outcomes. In this work, we propose a \textbf{one-line modification in Pytorch} to any momentum-based optimizer, which we rename cautious optimizer, e.g. C-AdamW and C-Lion. Our theoretical result shows that this modification preserves Adam's Hamiltonian function and it does not break the convergence guarantee under the Lyapunov analysis. In addition, a whole new family of optimizers is revealed by our theoretical insight. Among them, we pick the simplest one for empirical experiments, showing not only consistent speed-up on LLM pretraining, but also image classification, with minimum extra tuning on hyperparameters.

However, existing approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, while effective on reasoning benchmarks, struggle with agentic tasks that require iterative decision-making. We introduce MURPHY, a multi-turn RLVR framework that incorporates execution feedback directly into training, extending GRPO to optimize over multi-turn trajectories where models iteratively refine solutions. MURPHY combines a feedback conditioned rollout tree with trajectory-level credit assignment, and uses pruning to reduce the cost of multi-turn optimization. Evaluations on code generation benchmarks with two model families show that MURPHY consistently improves multi-iteration performance, achieving up to an 8% absolute gain in pass@1 over compute-matched GRPO baselines, and outperforming the prior leading method that incorporates multi-turn execution feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 2 figures, 8 Tables</p></details> |
| **[A Multi-Agent Framework for Code-Guided, Modular, and Verifiable Automated Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13937v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) has revolutionized the development of data-driven solutions; however, traditional frameworks often function as "black boxes", lacking the flexibility and transparency required for complex, real-world engineering tasks. Recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based agents have shifted toward code-driven approaches. However, they frequently suffer from hallucinated logic and logic entanglement, where monolithic code generation leads to unrecoverable runtime failures. In this paper, we present iML, a novel multi-agent framework designed to shift AutoML from black-box prompting to a code-guided, modular, and verifiable architectural paradigm. iML introduces three main ideas: (1) Code-Guided Planning, which synthesizes a strategic blueprint grounded in autonomous empirical profiling to eliminate hallucination; (2) Code-Modular Implementation, which decouples preprocessing and modeling into specialized components governed by strict interface contracts; and (3) Code-Verifiable Integration, which enforces physical feasibility through dynamic contract verification and iterative self-correction. We evaluate iML across MLE-BENCH and the newly introduced iML-BENCH, comprising a diverse range of real-world Kaggle competitions. The experimental results show iML's superiority over state-of-the-art agents, achieving a valid submission rate of 85% and a competitive medal rate of 45% on MLE-BENCH, with an average standardized performance score (APS) of 0.77. On iML-BENCH, iML significantly outperforms the other approaches by 38%-163% in APS. Furthermore, iML maintains a robust 70% success rate even under stripped task descriptions, effectively filling information gaps through empirical profiling. These results highlight iML's potential to bridge the gap between stochastic generation and reliable engineering, marking a meaningful step toward truly AutoML.</p></details> |  |
| **[Why Code, Why Now: Learnability, Computability, and the Real Limits of Machine Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13934v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation has progressed more reliably than reinforcement learning, largely because code has an information structure that makes it learnable. Code provides dense, local, verifiable feedback at every token, whereas most reinforcement learning problems do not. This difference in feedback quality is not binary but graded. We propose a five-level hierarchy of learnability based on information structure and argue that the ceiling on ML progress depends less on model size than on whether a task is learnable at all. The hierarchy rests on a formal distinction among three properties of computational problems (expressibility, computability, and learnability). We establish their pairwise relationships, including where implications hold and where they fail, and present a unified template that makes the structural differences explicit. The analysis suggests why supervised learning on code scales predictably while reinforcement learning does not, and why the common assumption that scaling alone will solve remaining ML challenges warrants scrutiny.</p></details> |  |
| **[Debugging code world models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07672v2)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code World Models (CWMs) are language models trained to simulate program execution by predicting explicit runtime state after every executed command. This execution-based world modeling enables internal verification within the model, offering an alternative to natural language chain-of-thought reasoning. However, the sources of errors and the nature of CWMs' limitations remain poorly understood. We study CWMs from two complementary perspectives: local semantic execution and long-horizon state tracking. On real-code benchmarks, we identify two dominant failure regimes. First, dense runtime state reveals produce token-intensive execution traces, leading to token-budget exhaustion on programs with long execution histories. Second, failures disproportionately concentrate in string-valued state, which we attribute to limitations of subword tokenization rather than program structure. To study long-horizon behavior, we use a controlled permutation-tracking benchmark that isolates state propagation under action execution. We show that long-horizon degradation is driven primarily by incorrect action generation: when actions are replaced with ground-truth commands, a Transformer-based CWM propagates state accurately over long horizons, despite known limitations of Transformers in long-horizon state tracking. These findings suggest directions for more efficient supervision and state representations in CWMs that are better aligned with program execution and data types.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 4 figures, under review in conference</p></details> |
| **[Automated Proof Generation for Rust Code via Self-Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15756v3)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring correctness is crucial for code generation. Formal verification offers a definitive assurance of correctness, but demands substantial human effort in proof construction and hence raises a pressing need for automation. The primary obstacle lies in the severe lack of data-there is much fewer proofs than code snippets for Large Language Models (LLMs) to train upon. In this paper, we introduce SAFE, a framework that overcomes the lack of human-written proofs to enable automated proof generation of Rust code. SAFE establishes a self-evolving cycle where data synthesis and fine-tuning collaborate to enhance the model capability, leveraging the definitive power of a symbolic verifier in telling correct proofs from incorrect ones. SAFE also re-purposes the large number of synthesized incorrect proofs to train the self-debugging capability of the fine-tuned models, empowering them to fix incorrect proofs based on the verifier's feedback. SAFE demonstrates superior efficiency and precision compared to GPT-4o. Through tens of thousands of synthesized proofs and the self-debugging mechanism, we improve the capability of open-source models, initially unacquainted with formal verification, to automatically write proofs for Rust code. This advancement leads to a significant improvement in performance, achieving a 52.52% accuracy rate in a benchmark crafted by human experts, a significant leap over GPT-4o's performance of 14.39%.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniCode: Augmenting Evaluation for Code Reasoning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17868v2)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current coding benchmarks often inflate Large Language Model (LLM) capabilities due to static paradigms and data contamination, enabling models to exploit statistical shortcuts rather than genuine reasoning. To address this, we introduce UniCode, a generative evaluation framework that systematically probes LLM limits via: (1) multi-dimensional augmentation transforming seed problems into complex variations to disrupt fixed algorithmic patterns; (2) a highly reliable, automated test generation pipeline for scalable evaluation; and (3) fine-grained metrics for rich error signals. Experiments reveal a 31.2% performance collapse in state-of-the-art models on UniCode, primarily driven by deficiencies in conceptual modeling and scalability reasoning rather than syntactic errors. Furthermore, we uncover a seed-problem regression where models revert to memorized seed logic rather than following new specifications, signaling a reliance on shortcuts over reasoning. This work validates UniCode as a robust framework to expose model fragility and foster reasoning-oriented code intelligence.</p></details> |  |

Among the possible error patterns, $(t_r,t_c)$-criss-cross deletions-where $t_r$ rows and $t_c$ columns are simultaneously deleted-are of particular significance. In this paper, we focus on $q$-ary $(1,1)$-criss-cross deletion correcting codes. We present a novel code construction and develop complete encoding, decoding, and data recovery algorithms for parameters $n \ge 11$ and $q \ge 3$. The complexity of the proposed encoding, decoding, and data recovery algorithms is $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. Furthermore, we show that for $n \ge 11$ and $q = Ω(n)$ (i.e., there exists a constant $c>0$ such that $q \ge cn$), both the code redundancy and the encoder redundancy of the constructed codes are $2n + 2\log_q n + \mathcal{O}(1)$, which attain the lower bound ($2n + 2\log_q n - 3$) within an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ gap. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first construction that can achieve the optimal redundancy with only an $\mathcal{O}(1)$ gap, while simultaneously featuring explicit encoding and decoding algorithms.</p></details> | 18 pages, 1 figure |

SecRepoBench has 318 code completion tasks in 27 C/C++ repositories, covering 15 CWEs. We evaluate 29 standalone LLMs and 15 code agents across 3 state-of-the-art agent frameworks using our benchmark. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with generating correct and secure code completions. However, code agents significantly outperform standalone LLMs. We show that SecRepoBench is more difficult than the prior state-of-the-art benchmark. Finally, our comprehensive analysis provides insights into potential directions for enhancing the ability of code agents to write correct and secure code in real-world repositories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constructing Quantum Convolutional Codes via Difference Triangle Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13505v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a construction of quantum convolutional codes (QCCs) based on difference triangle sets (DTSs). To construct QCCs, one must determine polynomial stabilizers $X(D)$ and $Z(D)$ that commute (symplectic orthogonality), while keeping the stabilizers sparse and encoding memory small. To construct Z(D), we show that one can use a reflection of the DTS indices of X(D), where X(D) corresponds to a classical convolutional self-orthogonal code (CSOC) constructed from strong DTS supports. The motivation of this approach is to provide a constructive design that guarantees a prescribed minimum distance. We provide numerical results demonstrating the construction for a variety of code rates.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a new structural invariant, the Residual Structural Polynomial, denoted by Delta_p(C) in F_p[D]. We construct this invariant via encoders which are reduced internal degree matrices (RIDM). We formally demonstrate that Delta_p(C) is an intrinsic characteristic of the code, invariant under equivalent RIDMs. A central result of this work is the establishment that Delta_p(C) serves as an algebraic criterion for intrinsic catastrophicity: we prove that a free code C admits a non-catastrophic realization if and only if Delta_p(C) is a monomial of the form D^s. Furthermore, we establish a fundamental duality theorem, proving that Delta_p(C) = Delta_p(C^perp). This result reveals a deep structural symmetry, showing that the "catastrophicity" of a free code is preserved under orthogonality.</p></details> | <details><summary>09 pa...</summary><p>09 pages.

| **[Sequential BP-based Decoding of QLDPC Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13420v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes are a leading approach to quantum error correction, yet conventional belief propagation (BP) decoders often perform poorly, primarily due to non-convergence exacerbated by stabilizer constraints, which induce short cycles and degeneracy. We propose two scheduling variants, sequential check node scheduling (SCNS) and sequential variable node scheduling (SVNS), that improve BP's error-correction ability by processing check nodes (CNs) or variable nodes (VNs), respectively, in a fixed order, stabilizing message updates and reducing stalls. We also employ this technique to an improved BP-variant called BP guided decimation (BPGD), where symbols are progressively fixed during decoding iterations. Here, we demonstrate that the sequential BPGD (SBPGD) decoder can further improve the convergence properties and performance of the decoder. On standard QLDPC benchmarks under a Pauli-X noise model, our sequential schedules are shown to lower the block error rate relative to conventional BP, and SBPGD outperforms BPGD while using significantly fewer decimation rounds, translating to lower computational cost. These results demonstrate that changing the update schedule, without altering the code, can improve both the reliability and efficiency of BP-based decoding for QLDPC codes. For the [[1922,50,16]] C2 hypergraph-product code with independent X errors, SVNS-BP surpasses BP-OSD-0 in error correction at roughly the same complexity as standard BP.</p></details> |  |
| **[Source Code Hotspots: A Diagnostic Method for Quality Issues](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13170v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software source code often harbours "hotspots": small portions of the code that change far more often than the rest of the project and thus concentrate maintenance activity. We mine the complete version histories of 91 evolving, actively developed GitHub repositories and identify 15 recurring line-level hotspot patterns that explain why these hotspots emerge. The three most prevalent patterns are Pinned Version Bump (26%), revealing brittle release practices; Long Line Change (17%), signalling deficient layout; and Formatting Ping-Pong (9%), indicating missing or inconsistent style automation. Surprisingly, automated accounts generate 74% of all hotspot edits, suggesting that bot activity is a dominant but largely avoidable source of noise in change histories. By mapping each pattern to concrete refactoring guidelines and continuous integration checks, our taxonomy equips practitioners with actionable steps to curb hotspots and systematically improve software quality in terms of configurability, stability, and changeability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at the 23rd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories</p></details> |
| **[A Survey of Code Review Benchmarks and Evaluation Practices in Pre-LLM and LLM Era](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13377v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is a critical practice in modern software engineering, helping developers detect defects early, improve code quality, and facilitate knowledge sharing. With the rapid advancement of large language models (LLMs), a growing body of work has explored automated support for code review. However, progress in this area is hindered by the lack of a systematic understanding of existing benchmarks and evaluation practices. Current code review datasets are scattered, vary widely in design, and provide limited insight into what review capabilities are actually being assessed. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey of code review benchmarks spanning both the Pre-LLM and LLM eras (2015--2025). We analyze 99 research papers (58 Pre-LLM era and 41 LLM era) and extract key metadata, including datasets, evaluation metrics, data sources, and target tasks. Based on this analysis, we propose a multi-level taxonomy that organizes code review research into five domains and 18 fine-grained tasks. Our study reveals a clear shift toward end-to-end generative peer review, increasing multilingual coverage, and a decline in standalone change understanding tasks. We further identify limitations of current benchmarks and outline future directions, including broader task coverage, dynamic runtime evaluation, and taxonomy-guided fine-grained assessment. This survey provides a structured foundation for developing more realistic and comprehensive benchmarks for LLM-based code review.</p></details> |  |
| **[Homeostatic Adaptation of Optimal Population Codes under Metabolic Stress](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07874v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Information processing in neural populations is inherently constrained by metabolic resource limits and noise properties, with dynamics that are not accurately described by existing mathematical models. Recent data, for example, shows that neurons in mouse visual cortex go into a "low power mode" in which they maintain firing rate homeostasis while expending less energy. This adaptation leads to increased neuronal noise and tuning curve flattening in response to metabolic stress. We have developed a theoretical population coding framework that captures this behavior using two novel, surprisingly simple constraints: an approximation of firing rate homeostasis and an energy limit tied to noise levels via biophysical simulation. A key feature of our contribution is an energy budget model directly connecting adenosine triphosphate (ATP) use in cells to a fully explainable mathematical framework that generalizes existing optimal population codes. Specifically, our simulation provides an energy-dependent dispersed Poisson noise model, based on the assumption that the cell will follow an optimal decay path to produce the least-noisy spike rate that is possible at a given cellular energy budget. Each state along this optimal path is associated with properties (resting potential and leak conductance) which can be measured in electrophysiology experiments and have been shown to change under prolonged caloric deprivation. We analytically derive the optimal coding strategy for neurons under varying energy budgets and coding goals, and show how our method uniquely captures how populations of tuning curves adapt while maintaining homeostasis, as has been observed empirically.</p></details> |  |

In production, these systems process arbitrary inputs for which no ground-truth code exists, making output quality difficult to assess. We propose a reference-free evaluation framework that monitors flowchart image-to-code generation quality at inference time, using only the input image and the generated output. The framework introduces two automated metrics: $\text{Recall}{\text{OCR}}$, which estimates content coverage by extracting text from the input image via OCR as a proxy reference, and $\text{Precision}{\text{VE}}$, which detects hallucinated elements through Visual Entailment against the original image. Their harmonic mean, $\text{F1}{\text{OCR-VE}}$, provides a unified quality score. Validation on the FlowVQA dataset shows strong agreement with ground-truth metrics (average Pearson's $r = 0.97$, $0.91$, and $0.94$ for Recall, Precision, and F1, respectively), confirming the framework's reliability as a practical, reference-free alternative for continuous quality monitoring in production settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 tables.

We establish properties and bounds for intersecting codes with the Hamming metric and illustrate how these distinguish the subfamily of minimal codes within the family of intersecting codes. We prove that the property of a code being intersecting is characterized by the matroid-theoretic notion of vertical connectivity, showing that intersecting codes are precisely those achieving the highest possible value of this parameter. We then introduce the concept of vertical connectivity for $q$-matroids and link it to the theory of intersecting codes endowed with the rank metric.</p></details> |  |
| **[ViMedCSS: A Vietnamese Medical Code-Switching Speech Dataset & Benchmark](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12911v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code-switching (CS), which is when Vietnamese speech uses English words like drug names or procedures, is a common phenomenon in Vietnamese medical communication. This creates challenges for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, especially in low-resource languages like Vietnamese. Current most ASR systems struggle to recognize correctly English medical terms within Vietnamese sentences, and no benchmark addresses this challenge. In this paper, we construct a 34-hour \textbf{Vi}etnamese \textbf{Med}ical \textbf{C}ode-\textbf{S}witching \textbf{S}peech dataset (ViMedCSS) containing 16,576 utterances. Each utterance includes at least one English medical term drawn from a curated bilingual lexicon covering five medical topics. Using this dataset, we evaluate several state-of-the-art ASR models and examine different specific fine-tuning strategies for improving medical term recognition to investigate the best approach to solve in the dataset. Experimental results show that Vietnamese-optimized models perform better on general segments, while multilingual pretraining helps capture English insertions. The combination of both approaches yields the best balance between overall and code-switched accuracy. This work provides the first benchmark for Vietnamese medical code-switching and offers insights into effective domain adaptation for low-resource, multilingual ASR systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at LREC 2026</p></details> |

While recent works have proposed rate-distortion bounds for coding for machines, these results often rely on strong assumptions on task identifiability and neglect the impact of deployed task models. In this work, we revisit the fundamental limits of single-TOSC through the lens of indirect rate-distortion theory. We highlight the conditions under which existing rate-distortion bounds are achievable and show their limitations in realistic settings. We then introduce task model-aware rate-distortion bounds that account for task model suboptimality and architectural constraints. Experiments on standard classification benchmarks confirm that current learned TOSC schemes operate far from these limits, highlighting transmitter-side complexity as a key bottleneck.</p></details> | 8 pages, 4 figures |

One of the most common applications of these LLM Agents is in computer programming, where agents can successfully work alongside humans to generate code while controlling programming environments or networking systems. However, with the increasing ability and complexity of these agents comes dangers about the potential for their misuse. A concerning application of LLM agents is in the domain cybersecurity, where they have the potential to greatly expand the threat imposed by attacks such as social engineering. This is due to the fact that LLM Agents can work autonomously and perform many tasks that would normally require time and effort from skilled human programmers. While this threat is concerning, little attention has been given to assessments of the capabilities of LLM coding agents in generating code for social engineering attacks. In this work we compare different LLMs in their ability and willingness to produce potentially dangerous code bases that could be misused by cyberattackers. The result is a dataset of 200 website code bases and logs from 40 different LLM coding agents. Analysis of models shows which metrics of LLMs are more and less correlated with performance in generating spear-phishing sites. Our analysis and the dataset we present will be of interest to researchers and practitioners concerned in defending against the potential misuse of LLMs in spear-phishing.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 Pa...</summary><p>18 Pages, 7 Figures, 1 Table.

| **[Construction of MRD Codes Based on Circular-Shift Operations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12766v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most well-known constructions of $(N \times n, q^{Nk}, d)$ maximum rank distance (MRD) codes rely on the arithmetic of $\mathbb{F}_{q^N}$, whose increasing complexity with larger $N$ hinders parameter selection and practical implementation. In this work, based on circular-shift operations, we present a construction of $(J \times n, q^{Jk}, d)$ MRD codes with efficient encoding, where $J$ equals to the Euler's totient function of a defined $L$ subject to $\gcd(q, L) = 1$. The proposed construction is performed entirely over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and avoids the arithmetic of $\mathbb{F}_{q^J}$. We further characterize the constructed MRD codes, Gabidulin codes and twisted Gabidulin codes using a set of $q$-linearized polynomials over the row vector space $\mathbb{F}_{q}^N$, and clarify their inherent difference and connection. For the case $J \neq m_L$, where $m_L$ denotes the multiplicative order of $q$ modulo $L$, we show that the proposed MRD codes, in a family of settings, are different from any Gabidulin code and any twisted Gabidulin code. For the case $J = m_L$, we prove that every constructed $(J \times n, q^{Jk}, d)$ MRD code coincides with a $(J \times n, q^{Jk}, d)$ Gabidulin code, yielding an equivalent circular-shift-based construction that operates directly over $\mathbb{F}_q$. In addition, we prove that under some parameter settings, the constructed MRD codes are equivalent to a generalization of Gabidulin codes obtained by summing and concatenating several $(m_L \times n, q^{m_Lk}, d)$ Gabidulin codes. When $q=2$, $L$ is prime and $n\leq m_L$, it is analyzed that generating a codeword of the proposed $((L-1) \times n, 2^{(L-1)k}, d)$ MRD codes requires $O(nkL)$ exclusive OR (XOR) operations, while generating a codeword of $((L-1) \times n, 2^{(L-1)k}, d)$ Gabidulin codes, based on customary construction, requires $O(nkL^2)$ XOR operations.</p></details> |  |

Traditional approaches, such as static and dynamic analysis, extract valuable insights from stripped binaries, but often demand substantial expertise and manual effort. Recent advances in deep learning have opened promising opportunities to enhance binary analysis by capturing latent features and disclosing underlying code semantics. Despite the growing number of binary analysis models based on machine learning, their robustness to adversarial code transformations at the binary level remains underexplored. We evaluate the robustness of deep learning models for the task of binary code similarity detection (BCSD) under semantics-preserving transformations. The unique nature of machine instructions presents distinct challenges compared to the typical input perturbations found in other domains. We introduce asmFooler, a system that evaluates the resilience of BCSD models using a diverse set of adversarial code transformations that preserve functional semantics. We construct a dataset of 9,565 binary variants from 620 baseline samples by applying eight semantics-preserving transformations across six representative BCSD models. Our major findings highlight several key insights: i) model robustness relies on the processing pipeline, including code pre-processing, architecture, and feature selection; ii) adversarial transformation effectiveness is bounded by a budget shaped by model-specific constraints like input size and instruction expressive capacity; iii) well-crafted transformations can be highly effective with minimal perturbations; and iv) such transformations efficiently disrupt model decisions (e.g., misleading to false positives or false negatives) by focusing on semantically significant instructions.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 9 figures, 5 tables.

Human-AI Collaboration for Code Comprehension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04553v3)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding an unfamiliar codebase is an essential task for developers in various scenarios, such as during the onboarding process. Especially when the codebase is large and time is limited, achieving a decent level of comprehension remains challenging for both experienced and novice developers, even with the assistance of LLMs. Existing studies have shown that LLMs often fail to support users in understanding code structures or to provide user-centered, adaptive, and dynamic assistance in real-world settings. To address this, we propose learning from the perspective of a unique role, code auditors, whose work often requires them to quickly familiarize themselves with new code projects on a weekly or even daily basis. To achieve this, we recruited and interviewed 8 code auditing practitioners to understand how they master codebase understanding. We identified four design opportunities for an LLM-based codebase understanding system: supporting cognitive alignment through automated codebase information extraction, decomposition, and representation, as well as reducing manual effort and conversational distraction through interaction design. To validate these four design opportunities, we designed a system prototype, CodeMap, that provides dynamic information extraction and representation aligned with the human cognitive flow and enables interactive switching among hierarchical codebase visualizations. We then conducted a user study with nine experienced developers and six novice developers. Our results demonstrate that CodeMap significantly improved users' perceived intuitiveness, ease of use, and usefulness in supporting code comprehension, while reducing their reliance on reading and interpreting LLM responses by 79% and increasing map usage time by 90% compared to the static visualization analysis tool.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 34th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC 2026)</p></details> |

Popular quantum error correction schemes include CSS code, of which surface codes provide regular mappings onto 2D planes suitable for contemporary quantum devices together with known transversal logical gates. Recently, qLDPC codes have been proposed as a means to provide denser encoding with the class of bivariate bicycle (BB) codes promising feasible design for devices. This work contributes a novel subclass of BB codes suitable for quantum error correction. This subclass employs {\em coprimes} and the product $xy$ of the two generating variables $x$ and $y$ to construct polynomials, rather than using $x$ and $y$ separately as in vanilla BB codes. In contrast to vanilla BB codes, where parameters remain unknown prior to code discovery, the rate of the proposed code can be determined beforehand by specifying a factor polynomial as an input to the numerical search algorithm. Using this coprime-BB construction, we found a number of surprisingly short to medium-length codes that were previously unknown. We also propose a layout on cold atom arrays tailored for coprime-BB codes. The proposed layout reduces both move time for short to medium-length codes and the number of moves of atoms to perform syndrome extractions. We consider an error model with global laser noise on cold atoms, and simulations show that our proposed layout achieves significant improvements over prior work across the simulated codes.</p></details> | accepted by quantum |

The scheme uses two decoder views linked by automorphisms of the polar transform and publicly draws the encoder at random from the corresponding automorphism group. This yields perfect secrecy for Bob at any blocklength. Secrecy for Alice is obtained asymptotically via channel polarization combined with privacy amplification. Because the construction deliberately injects randomness into selected bad bit-channels, we derive a relaxed reliability criterion, which is empirically certified via Monte-Carlo simulations. We also evaluate finite-blocklength performance. Finally, we characterize the polar-transform automorphisms as bit-level permutations of bit-channel indices, and exploit this structure to derive and optimize an achievable finite-blocklength rate.</p></details> | 51 pages, 3 figures |

In this work, we study the design of communication rate-optimal device-to-device (D2D) coded caching schemes with minimal subpacketization levels, a key bottleneck in finite-length settings. We present a novel \tit{packet type-based} (PT) design framework that (i) strategically introduces \tit{asymmetry} into file splitting through user grouping, and (ii) systematically exploits such asymmetry in both cache placement and multicast delivery to create subpacketization reduction opportunities. In particular, the induced asymmetry gives rise to two fundamental forms of subpacketization reduction gains: the \emph{subfile saving gain}, achieved by eliminating certain types of subfiles through careful user grouping and transmitter selection, and the \emph{further splitting saving gain}, attained by reducing the splitting granularity for the remaining subfiles. The combined effect of these two reduction gains yields an overall subpacketization improvement over the original Ji-Caire-Molisch (JCM) caching scheme~\cite{ji2016fundamental}, as well as various state-of-the-art schemes, while preserving optimal communication rates. Under the PT framework, we formulate the caching scheme design as an integer linear program (ILP), where each feasible solution corresponds to a valid rate-optimal D2D coded caching scheme with potentially reduced subpacketization relative to the JCM baseline.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |

In this paper, we present the first category-level empirical study of agent-generated code in open-source mobile app projects. We analyzed PR acceptance behaviors across mobile platforms, agents, and task categories using 2,901 AI-authored pull requests (PRs) in 193 verified Android and iOS open-source GitHub repositories in the AIDev dataset. We find that Android projects have received 2x more AI-authored PRs and have achieved higher PR acceptance rate (71%) than iOS (63%), with significant agent-level variation on Android. Across task categories, PRs with routine tasks (feature, fix, and ui) achieve the highest acceptance, while structural changes like refactor and build achieve lower success and longer resolution times. Furthermore, our evolution analysis shows improvement in PR resolution time on Android through mid-2025 before it declined again. Our findings offer the first evidence-based characterization of AI agents effects on OSS mobile projects and establish empirical baselines for evaluating agent-generated contributions to design platform aware agentic systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at MSR 2026 Mining Challenge track</p></details> |
| **[Perceptual Self-Reflection in Agentic Physics Simulation Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12311v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a multi-agent framework for generating physics simulation code from natural language descriptions, featuring a novel perceptual self-reflection mechanism for validation. The system employs four specialized agents: a natural language interpreter that converts user requests into physics-based descriptions; a technical requirements generator that produces scaled simulation parameters; a physics code generator with automated self-correction; and a physics validator that implements perceptual self-reflection. The key innovation is perceptual validation, which analyzes rendered animation frames using a vision-capable language model rather than inspecting code structure directly. This approach addresses the ``oracle gap'' where syntactically correct code produces physically incorrect behavior--a limitation that conventional testing cannot detect. We evaluate the system across seven domains including classical mechanics, fluid dynamics, thermodynamics, electromagnetics, wave physics, reaction-diffusion systems, and non-physics data visualization. The perceptual self-reflection architecture demonstrates substantial improvement over single-shot generation baselines, with the majority of tested scenarios achieving target physics accuracy thresholds. The system exhibits robust pipeline stability with consistent code self-correction capability, operating at approximately \$0.20 per animation. These results validate our hypothesis that feeding visual simulation outputs back to a vision-language model for iterative refinement significantly outperforms single-shot code generation for physics simulation tasks and highlights the potential of agentic AI to support engineering workflows and physics data generation pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 2 figures, 2 tables.

| **[Improving HPC Code Generation Capability of LLMs via Online Reinforcement Learning with Real-Machine Benchmark Rewards](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12049v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong code generation capabilities, yet the runtime performance of generated code is not guaranteed, and there have been few attempts to train LLMs using runtime performance as a reward in the HPC domain. We propose an online reinforcement learning approach that executes LLM-generated code on a supercomputer and directly feeds back the measured runtime performance (GFLOPS) as a reward. We further introduce a Staged Quality-Diversity (SQD) algorithm that progressively varies the permitted optimization techniques on a per-problem basis, enabling the model to learn code optimization from diverse perspectives. We build a distributed system connecting a GPU training cluster with a CPU benchmarking cluster, and train Qwen2.5 Coder 14B on a double-precision matrix multiplication task using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Through two experiments, we show that reinforcement learning combining runtime performance feedback with staged optimization can improve the HPC code generation capability of LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating AGENTS.md: Are Repository-Level Context Files Helpful for Coding Agents?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11988v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A widespread practice in software development is to tailor coding agents to repositories using context files, such as AGENTS.md, by either manually or automatically generating them. Although this practice is strongly encouraged by agent developers, there is currently no rigorous investigation into whether such context files are actually effective for real-world tasks. In this work, we study this question and evaluate coding agents' task completion performance in two complementary settings: established SWE-bench tasks from popular repositories, with LLM-generated context files following agent-developer recommendations, and a novel collection of issues from repositories containing developer-committed context files. Across multiple coding agents and LLMs, we find that context files tend to reduce task success rates compared to providing no repository context, while also increasing inference cost by over 20%. Behaviorally, both LLM-generated and developer-provided context files encourage broader exploration (e.g., more thorough testing and file traversal), and coding agents tend to respect their instructions. Ultimately, we conclude that unnecessary requirements from context files make tasks harder, and human-written context files should describe only minimal requirements.</p></details> |  |

We present the broadcast adaptation of dependence testing bound of Polyanskiy et al. 2010, which is an upper bound on the average error probability that depends on the channel dispersion terms of each error event for fixed input. Additionally, we introduce the $κβ$ lower bounds on the maximal code sizes of each user using dirty paper coding.</p></details> |  |
| **[VibeCodeHPC: An Agent-Based Iterative Prompting Auto-Tuner for HPC Code Generation Using LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00031v3)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we propose VibeCodeHPC, a multi-agent system based on large language models (LLMs) for the automatic tuning of high-performance computing (HPC) programs on supercomputers. VibeCodeHPC adopts Claude Code as its backend and provides an integrated environment that facilitates program development in supercomputer settings. The system not only brings the Vibe Coding paradigm -- program development through natural language interaction with users -- to HPC programming, but also enables autonomous performance optimization with minimal user intervention through a sophisticated multi-agent design. To achieve these objectives, VibeCodeHPC implements three core functionalities: (1) configuration capabilities tailored to the unique development environments of supercomputers, (2) collaborative operation among multiple LLM agents with distinct roles -- Project Manager (PM), System Engineer (SE), Programmer (PG), and Continuous Deliverer (CD), and (3) long-term autonomous operation through agent activity monitoring and dynamic deployment mechanisms. This paper highlights one of the most powerful features of VibeCodeHPC: fully automated code optimization through autonomous operation without user intervention. Specifically, it demonstrates the performance optimization of CPU-based codes on GPU-equipped systems for matrix multiplication and a Poisson equation solver using Jacobi's iterative method. The results show that the multi-agent configuration employed in VibeCodeHPC enables faster and more reliable development of higher-performance code compared to a single-agent setup.</p></details> |  |
| **[Controlled Self-Evolution for Algorithmic Code Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.07348v5)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-evolution methods enhance code generation through iterative "generate-verify-refine" cycles, yet existing approaches suffer from low exploration efficiency, failing to discover solutions with superior complexity within limited budgets. This inefficiency stems from initialization bias trapping evolution in poor solution regions, uncontrolled stochastic operations lacking feedback guidance, and insufficient experience utilization across tasks. To address these bottlenecks, we propose Controlled Self-Evolution (CSE), which consists of three key components. Diversified Planning Initialization generates structurally distinct algorithmic strategies for broad solution space coverage. Genetic Evolution replaces stochastic operations with feedback-guided mechanisms, enabling targeted mutation and compositional crossover. Hierarchical Evolution Memory captures both successful and failed experiences at inter-task and intra-task levels. Experiments on EffiBench-X demonstrate that CSE consistently outperforms all baselines across various LLM backbones. Furthermore, CSE achieves higher efficiency from early generations and maintains continuous improvement throughout evolution. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/QuantaAlpha/EvoControl.</p></details> | 27 pages |
| **[Studying Quality Improvements Recommended via Manual and Automated Code Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11925v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Several Deep Learning (DL)-based techniques have been proposed to automate code review. Still, it is unclear the extent to which these approaches can recommend quality improvements as a human reviewer. We study the similarities and differences between code reviews performed by humans and those automatically generated by DL models, using ChatGPT-4 as representative of the latter. In particular, we run a mining-based study in which we collect and manually inspect 739 comments posted by human reviewers to suggest code changes in 240 PRs. The manual inspection aims at classifying the type of quality improvement recommended by human reviewers (e.g., rename variable/constant). Then, we ask ChatGPT to perform a code review on the same PRs and we compare the quality improvements it recommends against those suggested by the human reviewers. We show that while, on average, ChatGPT tends to recommend a higher number of code changes as compared to human reviewers (~2.4x more), it can only spot 10% of the quality issues reported by humans. However, ~40% of the additional comments generated by the LLM point to meaningful quality issues. In short, our findings show the complementarity of manual and AI-based code review. This finding suggests that, in its current state, DL-based code review can be used as a further quality check on top of the one performed by humans, but should not be considered as a valid alternative to them nor as a mean to save code review time, since human reviewers would still need to perform their manual inspection while also validating the quality issues reported by the DL-based technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 34th International Conference on Program Comprehension (ICPC 2026)</p></details> |

| **[Physical Activity Trajectories Preceding Incident Major Depressive Disorder Diagnosis Using Consumer Wearable Devices in the All of Us Research Program: Case-Control Study](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16583v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low physical activity is a known risk factor for major depressive disorder (MDD), but changes in activity before a first clinical diagnosis remain unclear, especially using long-term objective measurements. This study characterized trajectories of wearable-measured physical activity during the year preceding incident MDD diagnosis. We conducted a retrospective nested case-control study using linked electronic health record and Fitbit data from the All of Us Research Program. Adults with at least 6 months of valid wearable data in the year before diagnosis were eligible. Incident MDD cases were matched to controls on age, sex, body mass index, and index time (up to four controls per case). Daily step counts and moderate-to-vigorous physical activity (MVPA) were aggregated into monthly averages. Linear mixed-effects models compared trajectories from 12 months before diagnosis to diagnosis. Within cases, contrasts identified when activity first significantly deviated from levels 12 months prior. The cohort included 4,104 participants (829 cases and 3,275 controls; 81.7% women; median age 48.4 years). Compared with controls, cases showed consistently lower activity and significant downward trajectories in both step counts and MVPA during the year before diagnosis (P < 0.001). Significant declines appeared about 4 months before diagnosis for step counts and 5 months for MVPA. Exploratory analyses suggested subgroup differences, including steeper declines in men, greater intensity reductions at older ages, and persistently low activity among individuals with obesity. Sustained within-person declines in physical activity emerged months before incident MDD diagnosis. Longitudinal wearable monitoring may provide early signals to support risk stratification and earlier intervention.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we develop new algorithmic techniques for automatically verifying C-RASPs. To this end, we establish a connection to the verification of synchronous dataflow programs in Lustre, which enables us to exploit state-of-the-art model checkers utilizing highly optimized SMT-solvers. Our second contribution addresses learning a C-RASP program in the first place. To this end, we provide a new algorithm for learning a C-RASP from examples using local search. We demonstrate efficacy of our implementation for benchmarks of C-RASPs in the literature, in particular in connection to the following applications: (1) transformer program optimization, and (2) constrained learning of transformer programs (based on a partial specification).</p></details> |  |
| **[CADEvolve: Creating Realistic CAD via Program Evolution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16317v1)** | 2026-02-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-Aided Design (CAD) delivers rapid, editable modeling for engineering and manufacturing. Recent AI progress now makes full automation feasible for various CAD tasks. However, progress is bottlenecked by data: public corpora mostly contain sketch-extrude sequences, lack complex operations, multi-operation composition and design intent, and thus hinder effective fine-tuning. Attempts to bypass this with frozen VLMs often yield simple or invalid programs due to limited 3D grounding in current foundation models. We present CADEvolve, an evolution-based pipeline and dataset that starts from simple primitives and, via VLM-guided edits and validations, incrementally grows CAD programs toward industrial-grade complexity. The result is 8k complex parts expressed as executable CadQuery parametric generators. After multi-stage post-processing and augmentation, we obtain a unified dataset of 1.3m scripts paired with rendered geometry and exercising the full CadQuery operation set. A VLM fine-tuned on CADEvolve achieves state-of-the-art results on the Image2CAD task across the DeepCAD, Fusion 360, and MCB benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Heuristic Search as Language-Guided Program Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16038v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced Automated Heuristic Design (AHD) in combinatorial optimization (CO) in the past few years. However, existing discovery pipelines often require extensive manual trial-and-error or reliance on domain expertise to adapt to new or complex problems. This stems from tightly coupled internal mechanisms that limit systematic improvement of the LLM-driven design process. To address this challenge, we propose a structured framework for LLM-driven AHD that explicitly decomposes the heuristic discovery process into modular stages: a forward pass for evaluation, a backward pass for analytical feedback, and an update step for program refinement. This separation provides a clear abstraction for iterative refinement and enables principled improvements of individual components. We validate our framework across four diverse real-world CO domains, where it consistently outperforms baselines, achieving up to $0.17$ improvement in QYI on unseen test sets. Finally, we show that several popular AHD methods are restricted instantiations of our framework. By integrating them in our structured pipeline, we can upgrade the components modularly and significantly improve their performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 3 figures, under review</p></details> |
| **[ODYN: An All-Shifted Non-Interior-Point Method for Quadratic Programming in Robotics and AI](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.16005v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce ODYN, a novel all-shifted primal-dual non-interior-point quadratic programming (QP) solver designed to efficiently handle challenging dense and sparse QPs. ODYN combines all-shifted nonlinear complementarity problem (NCP) functions with proximal method of multipliers to robustly address ill-conditioned and degenerate problems, without requiring linear independence of the constraints. It exhibits strong warm-start performance and is well suited to both general-purpose optimization, and robotics and AI applications, including model-based control, estimation, and kernel-based learning methods. We provide an open-source implementation and benchmark ODYN on the Maros-Mészáros test set, demonstrating state-of-the-art convergence performance in small-to-high-scale problems. The results highlight ODYN's superior warm-starting capabilities, which are critical in sequential and real-time settings common in robotics and AI. These advantages are further demonstrated by deploying ODYN as the backend of an SQP-based predictive control framework (OdynSQP), as the implicitly differentiable optimization layer for deep learning (ODYNLayer), and the optimizer of a contact-dynamics simulation (ODYNSim).</p></details> |  |
| **[Distributed Order Recording Techniques for Efficient Record-and-Replay of Multi-threaded Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15995v1)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>After all these years and all these other shared memory programming frameworks, OpenMP is still the most popular one. However, its greater levels of non-deterministic execution makes debugging and testing more challenging. The ability to record and deterministically replay the program execution is key to address this challenge. However, scalably replaying OpenMP programs is still an unresolved problem. In this paper, we propose two novel techniques that use Distributed Clock (DC) and Distributed Epoch (DE) recording schemes to eliminate excessive thread synchronization for OpenMP record and replay. Our evaluation on representative HPC applications with ReOMP, which we used to realize DC and DE recording, shows that our approach is 2-5x more efficient than traditional approaches that synchronize on every shared-memory access. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our approach can be easily combined with MPI-level replay tools to replay non-trivial MPI+OpenMP applications. We achieve this by integrating \toolname into ReMPI, an existing scalable MPI record-and-replay tool, with only a small MPI-scale-independent runtime overhead.</p></details> | IEEE Cluster 2024 |
| **[Binary integer programming for optimizing ebit cost in distributed quantum circuits with fixed module allocation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.11816v3)** | 2026-02-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modular and networked quantum architectures can scale beyond the qubit count of a single device, but executing a circuit across modules requires implementing non-local two-qubit gates using shared entanglement (ebits) and classical communication, making ebit cost a central resource in distributed execution. The resulting distributed quantum circuit (DQC) problem is combinatorial, motivating prior heuristic approaches such as hypergraph partitioning. In this work, we decouple module allocation from distribution. For a fixed module allocation (i.e., assignment of each qubit to a specific Quantum Processing Unit), we formulate the remaining distribution layer as an exact binary integer programming (BIP). This yields solver-optimal distributions for the fixed-allocation subproblem and can be used as a post-processing step on top of any existing allocation method. We derive compact BIP formulations for four or more modules and a tighter specialization for three modules. Across a diverse benchmark suite, BIP post-processing reduces ebit cost by up to 20\% for random circuits and by more than an order of magnitude for some arithmetic circuits. While the method incurs offline classical overhead, it is amortized when circuits are executed repeatedly.</p></details> | 38 pages, 22 figures |
| **[Optimal Program Synthesis via Abstract Interpretation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14717v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the problem of synthesizing programs with numerical constants that optimize a quantitative objective, such as accuracy, over a set of input-output examples. We propose a general framework for optimal synthesis of such programs in a given domain specific language (DSL), with provable optimality guarantees. Our framework enumerates programs in a general search graph, where nodes represent subsets of concrete programs. To improve scalability, it uses A* search in conjunction with a search heuristic based on abstract interpretation; intuitively, this heuristic establishes upper bounds on the value of subtrees in the search graph, enabling the synthesizer to identify and prune subtrees that are provably suboptimal. In addition, we propose a natural strategy for constructing abstract transformers for monotonic semantics, which is a common property for components in DSLs for data classification. Finally, we implement our approach in the context of two such existing DSLs, demonstrating that our algorithm is more scalable than existing optimal synthesizers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Resource-Aware Quantum Programming with General Recursion and Quantum Control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20452v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces the hybrid quantum language with general recursion $\mathtt{Hyrql}$, driven towards resource-analysis. By design, $\mathtt{Hyrql}$ does not require the specification of an initial set of quantum gates. Hence, it is well amenable towards a generic cost analysis, unlike languages that use different sets of quantum gates, which yield quantum circuits of distinct complexity. Regarding resource-analysis, we show how to relate the runtime of an expressive fragment of $\mathtt{Hyrql}$ programs with the size of the corresponding quantum circuits. We also manage to capture the class of functions computable in quantum polynomial time, which, by Yao's Theorem, corresponds to families of circuits of polynomial size. Consequently, this result paves the way for the use of termination and runtime-analysis techniques designed for classical programs to guarantee bounds on the size of quantum circuits.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inverse Mixed-Integer Programming: Learning Constraints then Objective Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04455v2)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data-driven inverse optimization for mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs), which seeks to learn an objective function and constraints consistent with observed decisions, is important for building accurate mathematical models in a variety of domains, including power systems and scheduling. However, to the best of our knowledge, existing data-driven inverse optimization methods primarily focus on learning objective functions under known constraints, and learning both objective functions and constraints from data remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we propose a two-stage approach for a class of inverse optimization problems in which the objective is a linear combination of given feature functions and the constraints are parameterized by unknown functions and thresholds. Our method first learns the constraints and then, conditioned on the learned constraints, estimates the objective-function weights. On the theoretical side, we provide finite-sample guarantees for solving the proposed inverse optimization problem. To this end, we develop statistical learning tools for pseudo-metric spaces under sub-Gaussian assumptions and use them to derive a learning-theoretic framework for inverse optimization with both unknown objectives and constraints. On the experimental side, we demonstrate that our method successfully solves inverse optimization problems on scheduling instances formulated as ILPs with up to 100 decision variables.</p></details> | 40 pages |
| **[Covariance-Aware Transformers for Quadratic Programming and Decision Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14506v1)** | 2026-02-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We explore the use of transformers for solving quadratic programs and how this capability benefits decision-making problems that involve covariance matrices. We first show that the linear attention mechanism can provably solve unconstrained QPs by tokenizing the matrix variables (e.g.~$A$ of the objective $\frac{1}{2}x^\top Ax+b^\top x$) row-by-row and emulating gradient descent iterations. Furthermore, by incorporating MLPs, a transformer block can solve (i) $\ell_1$-penalized QPs by emulating iterative soft-thresholding and (ii) $\ell_1$-constrained QPs when equipped with an additional feedback loop. Our theory motivates us to introduce Time2Decide: a generic method that enhances a time series foundation model (TSFM) by explicitly feeding the covariance matrix between the variates. We empirically find that Time2Decide uniformly outperforms the base TSFM model for the classical portfolio optimization problem that admits an $\ell_1$-constrained QP formulation. Remarkably, Time2Decide also outperforms the classical "Predict-then-Optimize (PtO)" procedure, where we first forecast the returns and then explicitly solve a constrained QP, in suitable settings. Our results demonstrate that transformers benefit from explicit use of second-order statistics, and this can enable them to effectively solve complex decision-making problems, like portfolio construction, in one forward pass.</p></details> |  |
| **[LongCLI-Bench: A Preliminary Benchmark and Study for Long-horizon Agentic Programming in Command-Line Interfaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14337v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in AI-assisted programming have empowered agents to execute complex workflows via command-line interfaces, however, existing benchmarks are limited by short task horizons, data contamination from GitHub scraping, and a lack of fine-grained evaluation metrics, fail to rigorously evaluate the long-horizon planning and execution capabilities essential for realistic software engineering. To address these gaps, we introduce LongCLI-Bench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate agentic capabilities across long-horizon, realistic tasks. We curated 20 high-quality, long-horizon tasks from over 1,000 computer science assignments and real-world workflows, covering four engineering categories: from scratch, feature addition, bug fixing, and refactoring. We propose a dual-set testing protocol for LongCLI-Bench, which measures requirement fulfillment (fail-to-pass) and regression avoidance (pass-to-pass), and incorporates step-level scoring to pinpoint execution failures. Extensive experiments reveal that even state-of-the-art agents achieve pass rates below 20% in LongCLI-Bench. Step-level analysis further indicates that the majority of tasks stall at less than 30% completion, highlighting that critical failures often occur in the early stages. Although self-correction offers marginal gains, human-agent collaboration through plan injection and interactive guidance yields significantly higher improvements. These results highlight that future research must emphasize the development of synergistic human-agent workflows alongside advances in agents' planning and execution capabilities to overcome key challenges in long-horizon task performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[AlphaOPT: Formulating Optimization Programs with Self-Improving LLM Experience Library](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18428v3)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization modeling underlies critical decision-making across industries, yet remains difficult to automate: natural-language problem descriptions must be translated into precise mathematical formulations and executable solver code. Existing LLM-based approaches typically rely on brittle prompting or costly retraining, both of which offer limited generalization. Recent work suggests that large models can improve via experience reuse, but how to systematically acquire, refine, and reuse such experience in structurally constrained settings remains unclear. We present \textbf{AlphaOPT}, a self-improving experience library that enables LLMs to learn optimization modeling knowledge from limited supervision, including answer-only feedback without gold-standard programs, annotated reasoning traces, or parameter updates. AlphaOPT operates in a continual two-phase cycle: a \emph{Library Learning} phase that extracts solver-verified, structured insights from failed attempts, and a \emph{Library Evolution} phase that refines the applicability of stored insights based on aggregate evidence across tasks. This design allows the model to accumulate reusable modeling principles, improve transfer across problem instances, and maintain bounded library growth over time. Evaluated on multiple optimization benchmarks, AlphaOPT steadily improves as more training data become available (65\% $\rightarrow$ 72\% from 100 to 300 training items) and outperforms the strongest baseline by 9.1\% and 8.2\% on two out-of-distribution datasets. These results demonstrate that structured experience learning, grounded in solver feedback, provides a practical alternative to retraining for complex reasoning tasks requiring precise formulation and execution. All code and data are available at: https://github.com/Minw913/AlphaOPT.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Penalty Approach for Differentiation Through Black-Box Quadratic Programming Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.14154v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiating through the solution of a quadratic program (QP) is a central problem in differentiable optimization. Most existing approaches differentiate through the Karush--Kuhn--Tucker (KKT) system, but their computational cost and numerical robustness can degrade at scale. To address these limitations, we propose dXPP, a penalty-based differentiation framework that decouples QP solving from differentiation. In the solving step (forward pass), dXPP is solver-agnostic and can leverage any black-box QP solver. In the differentiation step (backward pass), we map the solution to a smooth approximate penalty problem and implicitly differentiate through it, requiring only the solution of a much smaller linear system in the primal variables. This approach bypasses the difficulties inherent in explicit KKT differentiation and significantly improves computational efficiency and robustness. We evaluate dXPP on various tasks, including randomly generated QPs, large-scale sparse projection problems, and a real-world multi-period portfolio optimization task. Empirical results demonstrate that dXPP is competitive with KKT-based differentiation methods and achieves substantial speedups on large-scale problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 4 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

However, existing labeling approaches often struggle to balance label quality with labeling cost. To address this challenge, we propose DALL, a text labeling framework that integrates data programming, active learning, and large language models. DALL introduces a structured specification that allows users and large language models to define labeling functions via configuration, rather than code. Active learning identifies informative instances for review, and the large language model analyzes these instances to help users correct labels and to refine or suggest labeling functions. We implement DALL as an interactive labeling system for text labeling tasks. Comparative, ablation, and usability studies demonstrate DALL's efficiency, the effectiveness of its modules, and its usability.</p></details> |  |
| **[EVALOOOP: A Self-Consistency-Centered Framework for Assessing Large Language Model Robustness in Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12185v5)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the programming robustness of large language models (LLMs) is paramount for ensuring their reliability in AI-based software development. However, adversarial attacks exhibit fundamental limitations that compromise fair robustness assessment: they demonstrate contradictory evaluation outcomes where different attack strategies tend to favor different models, and more critically, they operate solely through external perturbations, failing to capture the intrinsic stability essential for autonomous coding agents where subsequent inputs are endogenously generated by the model itself. We introduce EVALOOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluates robustness from a self-consistency perspective, leveraging the natural duality inherent in software engineering tasks (e.g., code generation and code summarization). EVALOOOP establishes a self-contained feedback loop where an LLM iteratively transforms between code and natural language until functional failure occurs, with robustness quantified by a novel Average Sustainable Loops (ASL) metric-the mean number of iterations maintaining functional correctness across benchmark tasks. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without relying on external attack configurations, providing a unified metric that reveals how effectively LLMs preserve semantic integrity through sustained self-referential transformations. We evaluate 96 popular LLMs, ranging from 0.5B to 685B parameters, on EVALOOOP equipped with the MBPP Plus benchmark, and found that EVALOOOP typically induces a 2.65%-47.62% absolute drop in pass@1 accuracy within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, Qwen3-235B-A22B-Instruct-2507, despite inferior initial code generation compared to OpenAI's o-series models and DeepSeek-V3, demonstrated the superior robustness (ASL score).</p></details> | 27 pages, 7 figures |
| **[An effective Genetic Programming Hyper-Heuristic for Uncertain Agile Satellite Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.15070v1)** | 2026-02-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates a novel problem, namely the Uncertain Agile Earth Observation Satellite Scheduling Problem (UAEOSSP). Unlike the static AEOSSP, it takes into account a range of uncertain factors (e.g., task profit, resource consumption, and task visibility) in order to reflect the reality that the actual information is inherently unknown beforehand. An effective Genetic Programming Hyper-Heuristic (GPHH) is designed to automate the generation of scheduling policies. The evolved scheduling policies can be utilized to adjust plans in real time and perform exceptionally well. Experimental results demonstrate that evolved scheduling policies significantly outperform both well-designed Look-Ahead Heuristics (LAHs) and Manually Designed Heuristics (MDHs). Specifically, the policies generated by GPHH achieve an average improvement of 5.03% compared to LAHs and 8.14% compared to MDHs.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages; 4 figures; 9 tables;</p></details> |

J-DSP was created to support online laboratories in DSP classes and was first deployed in our ASU DSP class in 2000. The development of the program and its extensions was supported by several NSF grants including CCLI and IUSE. The web-based software was developed by our team in Java and later transitioned to the more secure HTML5 environment. J-DSP supports laboratory exercises on: digital filters and their design, the FFT and its utility in spectral analysis, machine learning for signal classification, and more recently online simulations with the Quantum Fourier Transform. Throughout the J-DSP development and deployment of this tool and its associated laboratory exercises, we documented evaluations. Mobile versions of the program for iOS and Android were also developed. J-DSP is used to this day in several universities, and specific functions of the program have been used in NSF REU, IRES and RET workforce development and high school outreach.</p></details> |  |
| **[ThunderAgent: A Simple, Fast and Program-Aware Agentic Inference System](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13692v1)** | 2026-02-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models(LLMs) are now used to power complex multi-turn agentic workflows. Existing systems run agentic inference by loosely assembling isolated components: an LLM inference engine (e.g., vLLM) and a tool orchestrator (e.g., Kubernetes). Although agentic workflows involve multiple LLM and tool requests, these systems schedule and allocate resources separately on a per-request basis, without end-to-end knowledge of the workflow. This leads to sub-optimal management of KV cache and tool execution environments. To address the challenges, we propose ThunderAgent, a fast, simple, and program-aware agentic inference system. We first abstract agentic workflows as LLM Programs, enabling a unified view of heterogeneous resources, including KV caches, system states, and external tool assets such as disk memory and network ports. Built upon this abstraction, ThunderAgent introduces a program-aware scheduler and a tool resource manager designed to maximize KV cache hit rates, mitigate memory imbalances, and enable asynchronous environment preparation. Evaluations across coding, routing, and scientific discovery agents demonstrate that ThunderAgent achieves 1.5-3.6x throughput improvements in serving, 1.8-3.9x in RL rollout, and up to 4.2x disk memory savings compared to state-of-the-art inference systems. To facilitate reproducibility and support future development, we open-source the system implementations of the whole ThunderAgent at: https://github.com/Agentic-Kinetics/ThunderAgent.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Speedups for Group Relaxations of Integer Linear Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.13494v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integer Linear Programs (ILPs) are a flexible and ubiquitous model for discrete optimization problems. Solving ILPs is \textsf{NP-Hard} yet of great practical importance. Super-quadratic quantum speedups for ILPs have been difficult to obtain because classical algorithms for many-constraint ILPs are global and exhaustive, whereas quantum frameworks that offer super-quadratic speedup exploit local structure of the objective and feasible set. We address this via quantum algorithms for Gomory's group relaxation. The group relaxation of an ILP is obtained by dropping nonnegativity on variables that are positive in the optimal solution of the linear programming (LP) relaxation, while retaining integrality of the decision variables. We present a competitive feasibility-preserving classical local-search algorithm for the group relaxation, and a corresponding quantum algorithm that, under reasonable technical conditions, achieves a super-quadratic speedup. When the group relaxation satisfies a nondegeneracy condition analogous to, but stronger than, LP non-degeneracy, our approach yields the optimal solution to the original ILP. Otherwise, the group relaxation tightens bounds on the optimal objective value of the ILP, and can improve downstream branch-and-cut by reducing the integrality gap; we numerically observe this on several practically relevant ILPs. To achieve these results, we derive efficiently constructible constraint-preserving mixers for the group relaxation with favorable spectral properties, which are of independent interest.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enabling Population-Level Parallelism in Tree-Based Genetic Programming for GPU Acceleration](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17168v7)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tree-based Genetic Programming (TGP) is a widely used evolutionary algorithm for tasks such as symbolic regression, classification, and robotic control. Due to the intensive computational demands of running TGP, GPU acceleration is crucial for achieving scalable performance. However, efficient GPU-based execution of TGP remains challenging, primarily due to three core issues: (1) the structural heterogeneity of program individuals, (2) the complexity of integrating multiple levels of parallelism, and (3) the incompatibility between high-performance CUDA execution and flexible Python-based environments. To address these issues, we propose EvoGP, a high-performance framework tailored for GPU acceleration of TGP via population-level parallel execution. First, EvoGP introduces a tensorized representation that encodes variable-sized trees into fixed-shape, memory-aligned arrays, enabling uniform memory access and parallel computation across diverse individuals. Second, EvoGP adopts an adaptive parallelism strategy that dynamically combines intra- and inter-individual parallelism based on dataset size, ensuring high GPU utilization across a broad spectrum of tasks. Third, EvoGP embeds custom CUDA kernels into the PyTorch runtime, achieving seamless integration with Python-based environments such as Gym, MuJoCo, Brax, and Genesis. Experimental results demonstrate that EvoGP achieves a peak throughput exceeding $10^{11}$ GPops/s. Specifically, this performance represents a speedup of up to $304\times$ over existing GPU-based TGP implementations and $18\times$ over state-of-the-art CPU-based libraries. Furthermore, EvoGP maintains comparable accuracy and exhibits improved scalability across large population sizes. EvoGP is open source and accessible at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/evogp.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE TEVC</p></details> |
| **[Solving Conic Programs over Sparse Graphs using a Variational Quantum Approach: The Case of the Optimal Power Flow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.00341v2)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conic programs arise broadly in physics, quantum information, machine learning, and engineering, many of which are defined over sparse graphs. Although such problems can be solved in polynomial time using classical interior-point solvers, the computational complexity scales unfavorably with graph size. In this context, this work proposes a variational quantum paradigm for solving conic programs, including quadratically constrained quadratic programs (QCQPs) and semidefinite programs (SDPs). We encode primal variables via the state of a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC), and dual variables via the probability mass function of a second PQC. The Lagrangian function can thus be expressed as scaled expectations of quantum observables. A primal-dual solution can be found by minimizing/maximizing the Lagrangian over the parameters of the first/second PQC. We pursue saddle points of the Lagrangian in a hybrid fashion. Gradients of the Lagrangian are estimated using the two PQCs, while PQC parameters are updated classically using a primal-dual method. We propose permuting the primal variables so that related observables are expressed in a banded form, enabling efficient measurement. The proposed framework is applied to the OPF problem, a large-scale optimization problem central to the operation of electric power systems. Numerical tests on the IEEE 57-node power system using Pennylane's simulator corroborate that the proposed doubly variational quantum framework can find high-quality OPF solutions. Although showcased for the OPF, this framework features a broader scope, including conic programs with numerous variables and constraints, problems defined over sparse graphs, and training quantum machine learning models to satisfy constraints.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 7 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Optimization under uncertainty: understanding orders and testing programs with specifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18561v3)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the most ubiquitous problems in optimization is that of finding all the elements of a finite set at which a function $f$ attains its minimum (or maximum). When the codomain of $f$ is equipped with a total order, it is easy to specify, implement, and verify generic solutions to this problem. But what if $f$ is affected by uncertainties? What if one seeks values that minimize more than one objective, or if $f$ does not return a single result but a set of possible results, or even a probability distribution? Such situations are common in climate science, economics, and engineering. Developing trustworthy solution methods for optimization under uncertainty requires formulating and answering these questions rigorously, including deciding which order relations to apply in different cases. We show how functional programming can support this task, and apply it to specify and test solution methods for cases where optimization is affected by two conceptually different kinds of uncertainty: value and functorial uncertainty. We analyze the interplay of orders in these contexts, demonstrate how standard minimization generalizes to partial orders in the multi-objective setting and how it can be lifted via monotonicity conditions to handle functorial uncertainty.</p></details> |  |
| **[PLLM: Pseudo-Labeling Large Language Models for CAD Program Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12561v1)** | 2026-02-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recovering Computer-Aided Design (CAD) programs from 3D geometries is a widely studied problem. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled progress in CAD program synthesis, but existing methods rely on supervised training with paired shape-program data, which is often unavailable. We introduce PLLM, a self-training framework for CAD program synthesis from unlabeled 3D shapes. Given a pre-trained CAD-capable LLM and a shape dataset, PLLM iteratively samples candidate programs, selects high-fidelity executions, and augments programs to construct synthetic program-shape pairs for fine-tuning. We experiment on adapting CAD-Recode from DeepCAD to the unlabeled ABC dataset show consistent improvements in geometric fidelity and program diversity.</p></details> |  |
| **[EvoCut: Strengthening Integer Programs via Evolution-Guided Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11850v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Integer programming (IP) is central to many combinatorial optimization tasks but remains challenging due to its NP-hard nature. A practical way to improve IP solvers is to manually design acceleration cuts, i.e., inequalities that speed up solving. However, this creative process requires deep expertise and has been difficult to automate. Our proposed framework, EvoCut, automates the generation of acceleration cuts at the symbolic modeling level: it reasons over a symbolic MILP model and a natural language description of the problem to discover a reusable set of acceleration cuts that can be used for each concrete instance of the model. EvoCut (i) initializes a population of candidate cuts via an initializer agent that uses an LLM, (ii) empirically screens candidates on a small verification set by checking that reference solutions remain feasible and that at least one stored LP relaxation solution is cut off, and (iii) iteratively refines the population through evolutionary crossover and mutation agents. Compared to baseline MILP formulations solved with a fixed time budget, EvoCut reduces optimality gaps by up to $76\%$ and reaches target gaps up to $7.2$ times faster (shifted geometric mean speedup). Ablations show its robustness across different LLM backends and across solvers/cut settings. Code: https://github.com/milad1378yz/EvoCut.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mixed-Integer Programming for Change-point Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11947v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a new mixed-integer programming (MIP) approach for offline multiple change-point detection by casting the problem as a globally optimal piecewise linear (PWL) fitting problem. Our main contribution is a family of strengthened MIP formulations whose linear programming (LP) relaxations admit integral projections onto the segment assignment variables, which encode the segment membership of each data point. This property yields provably tighter relaxations than existing formulations for offline multiple change-point detection. We further extend the framework to two settings of active research interest: (i) multidimensional PWL models with shared change-points, and (ii) sparse change-point detection, where only a subset of dimensions undergo structural change. Extensive computational experiments on benchmark real-world datasets demonstrate that the proposed formulations achieve reductions in solution times under both $\ell_1$ and $\ell_2$ loss functions in comparison to the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[OptiML: An End-to-End Framework for Program Synthesis and CUDA Kernel Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.12305v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating high-performance CUDA kernels remains challenging due to the need to navigate a combinatorial space of low-level transformations under noisy and expensive hardware feedback. Although large language models can synthesize functionally correct CUDA code, achieving competitive performance requires systematic exploration and verification of optimization choices. We present OptiML, an end-to-end framework that maps either natural-language intent or input CUDA code to performance-optimized CUDA kernels by formulating kernel optimization as search under verification. OptiML consists of two decoupled stages. When the input is natural language, a Mixture-of-Thoughts generator (OptiML-G) acts as a proposal policy over kernel implementation strategies, producing an initial executable program. A search-based optimizer (OptiML-X) then refines either synthesized or user-provided kernels using Monte Carlo Tree Search over LLM-driven edits, guided by a hardware-aware reward derived from profiler feedback. Each candidate transformation is compiled, verified, and profiled with Nsight Compute, and evaluated by a composite objective that combines runtime with hardware bottleneck proxies and guardrails against regressions. We evaluate OptiML in both synthesis-and-optimize and optimization-only settings on a diverse suite of CUDA kernels. Results show that OptiML consistently discovers verified performance improvements over strong LLM baselines and produces interpretable optimization trajectories grounded in profiler evidence.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Sequential to Parallel: Reformulating Dynamic Programming as GPU Kernels for Large-Scale Stochastic Combinatorial Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05179v2)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A major bottleneck in scenario-based Sample Average Approximation (SAA) for stochastic programming (SP) is the cost of solving an exact second-stage problem for every scenario, especially when each scenario contains an NP-hard combinatorial structure. This has led much of the SP literature to restrict the second stage to linear or simplified models. We develop a GPU-based framework that makes full-fidelity integer second-stage models tractable at scale. The key innovation is a set of hardware-aware, scenario-batched GPU kernels that expose parallelism across scenarios, dynamic-programming (DP) layers, and route or action options, enabling Bellman updates to be executed in a single pass over more than 1,000,000 realizations. We evaluate the approach in two representative SP settings: a vectorized split operator for stochastic vehicle routing and a DP for inventory reinsertion. Implementation scales nearly linearly in the number of scenarios and achieves a one-two to four-five orders of magnitude speedup, allowing far larger scenario sets and reliably stronger first-stage decisions. The computational leverage directly improves decision quality: much larger scenario sets and many more first-stage candidates can be evaluated within fixed time budgets, consistently yielding stronger SAA solutions. Our results show that full-fidelity integer second-stage models are tractable at scales previously considered impossible, providing a practical path to large-scale, realistic stochastic discrete optimization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Search-Based Quantum Program Testing via Commuting Pauli String](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11487v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum software testing is important for reliable quantum software engineering. Despite recent advances, existing quantum software testing approaches rely on simple test inputs and statistical oracles, costly program specifications, and limited validation on real quantum computers. To address these challenges, we propose SB-QOPS, a search-based quantum program testing approach via commuting Pauli strings. SB-QOPS, as a direct extension to a previously proposed QOPS approach, redefines test cases in terms of Pauli strings and introduces a measurement-centric oracle that exploits their commutation properties, enabling effective testing of quantum programs while reducing the need for full program specifications. By systematically exploring the search space through an expectation-value-based fitness function, SB-QOPS improves test budget utilization and increases the likelihood of uncovering subtle faults. We conduct a large-scale empirical evaluation on quantum circuits of up to 29 qubits on real quantum computers and emulators. We assess three search strategies: Genetic Algorithm, Hill Climbing, and the (1+1) Evolutionary Algorithm, and evaluate SB-QOPS under both simulated and real noisy conditions. Experiments span three quantum computing platforms: IBM, IQM, and Quantinuum. Results show that SB-QOPS significantly outperforms QOPS, achieving a fault-detection score of 100% for circuits up to 29 qubits, and demonstrating portability across quantum platforms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Compiler-Guided Inference-Time Adaptation: Improving GPT-5 Programming Performance in Idris](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.11481v1)** | 2026-02-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>GPT-5, a state of the art large language model from OpenAI, demonstrates strong performance in widely used programming languages such as Python, C++, and Java; however, its ability to operate in low resource or less commonly used languages remains underexplored. This work investigates whether GPT-5 can effectively acquire proficiency in an unfamiliar functional programming language, Idris, through iterative, feedback driven prompting. We first establish a baseline showing that with zero shot prompting the model solves only 22 out of 56 Idris exercises using the platform Exercism, substantially underperforming relative to higher resource languages (45 out of 50 in Python and 35 out of 47 in Erlang). We then evaluate several refinement strategies, including iterative prompting based on platform feedback, augmenting prompts with documentation and error classification guides, and iterative prompting using local compilation errors and failed test cases. Among these approaches, incorporating local compilation errors yields the most substantial improvements. Using this structured, error guided refinement loop, GPT-5 performance increased to an impressive 54 solved problems out of 56. These results suggest that while large language models may initially struggle in low resource settings, structured compiler level feedback can play a critical role in unlocking their capabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Combining Example-Based and Rule-Based Program Transformations to Resolve Build Conflicts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.19432v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Merge conflicts often arise when developers integrate changes from different software branches. The conflicts can result from overlapping edits in programs (i.e., textual conflicts) or cause build and test errors (i.e., build and test conflicts). They degrade software quality and hinder programmer productivity. While several tools detect build conflicts, few offer meaningful support for resolving them. To overcome limitations of existing tools, we introduce BuCoR (Build Conflict Resolver), a new conflict resolver. BuCoR first detects conflicts by comparing three versions related to a merging scenario: base b, left l, and right r. To resolve conflicts, it employs two complementary strategies: example-based transformation (BuCoR-E) and rule-based transformation (BuCoR-R). BuCoR-R applies predefined rules to resolve conflicts in frequently suggested or conventional ways. BuCoR-E mines branch versions (l and r) for exemplar edits applied to fix related build errors. From these examples, it infers and generalizes program transformation patterns to resolve conflicts in project-specific or unconventional ways. We evaluated BuCoR on 88 real-world build conflicts spanning 21 distinct conflict types. BuCoR generated at least one solution for 65 cases and correctly resolved 34 conflicts. We observed that this hybrid approach--combining context-aware, example-based learning with structured, rule-based resolution--can effectively help resolve conflicts. Our research sheds light on future directions for more intelligent and automated merge tools.</p></details> |  |

We first show some properties of optimal solutions, which are then used to decompose the problem into instances of the multidimensional knapsack cover problem with a single continuous variable per dimension. The proposed decomposition is used to design a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem with a fixed number of constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approximation scheme for such a general class of covering mixed-integer linear programs. Moreover, we design a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme and an approximate linear programming formulation for the case with a single constraint. These results improve upon the previously best-known 2-approximation algorithm for the knapsack cover problem with a single continuous variable. Finally, we show a perfect compact formulation for the case where all variables have the same lower and upper bounds. Analogous results are derived for the packing and more general variants of the problem.</p></details> | 20 pages |

GLP was designed as a language for grassroots platforms -- distributed systems with multiple instances that can operate independently of each other and of any global resource, and can coalesce into ever larger instances -- with its target architecture being smartphones communicating peer-to-peer. The operational semantics of Concurrent (single-agent) GLP and of multiagent GLP (maGLP) were defined via transition systems/multiagent transition systems, respectively. Here, we describe the mathematics developed to facilitate the workstation- and smartphone-based implementations of GLP by AI in Dart. We developed dGLP -- implementation-ready deterministic operational semantics for single-agent GLP -- and proved it correct with respect to the Concurrent GLP operational semantics; dGLP was used by AI as a formal spec, from which it developed a workstation-based implementation of GLP. We developed madGLP -- an implementation-ready multiagent operational semantics for maGLP -- and proved it correct with respect to the maGLP operational semantics; madGLP is deterministic at the agent level (not at the system level due to communication asynchrony), and is being used by AI as a formal spec from which it develops a smartphone-based implementation of maGLP.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Weakest Precondition Calculus for Programs and Linear Temporal Specifications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10746v1)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auto-active program verification rests on the ability to effectively the translation from annotated programs into verification conditions that are then discharged by automated theorem provers in the background. Characteristic such tools, e.g., Why3, Dafny, and Viper, is that this process does not involve user interaction, expecting all guiding hints like invariants to be given upfront. For sequential correctness, this paradigm is well established, thanks to approaches like weakest precondition generation and symbolic execution. However, to capture temporal properties, the specification language of choice for a broader system perspective, additional concerns and challenges are introduced into the translation and proof. Approaches based on symbolic model-checking can verify such properties on system models, e.g., using automata constructions. However, ascribing temporal properties to structured and data-intensive programs is more difficult. Several program calculi have been proposed in the literature, each of which on their own falls short in some regard of supporting an auto-active workflow. However, all essential ideas, while perhaps some are not widely acknowledged, are in fact found in the literature. In this paper, we demonstrate how to assemble these ideas into a weakest-precondition calculus for linear temporal properties and demonstrate it with examples.</p></details> |  |
| **[CODE-SHARP: Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.10085v2)** | 2026-02-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developing agents capable of open-endedly discovering and learning novel skills is a grand challenge in Artificial Intelligence. While reinforcement learning offers a powerful framework for training agents to master complex skills, it typically relies on hand-designed reward functions. This is infeasible for open-ended skill discovery, where the set of meaningful skills is not known a priori. While recent methods have shown promising results towards automating reward function design, they remain limited to refining rewards for pre-defined tasks. To address this limitation, we introduce Continuous Open-ended Discovery and Evolution of Skills as Hierarchical Reward Programs (CODE-SHARP), a novel framework leveraging Foundation Models (FM) to open-endedly expand and refine a hierarchical skill archive, structured as a directed graph of executable reward functions in code. We show that a goal-conditioned agent trained exclusively on the rewards generated by the discovered SHARP skills learns to solve increasingly long-horizon goals in the Craftax environment. When composed by a high-level FM-based planner, the discovered skills enable a single goal-conditioned agent to solve complex, long-horizon tasks, outperforming both pretrained agents and task-specific expert policies by over $134$% on average. We will open-source our code and provide additional videos at https://sites.google.com/view/code-sharp/homepage.</p></details> | Preprint |

Yet despite the introduction of natively multimodal Generative AI models, work on Human-GenAI collaborative coding has remained overwhelmingly focused on textual prompts -- largely ignoring the visual and spatial representations that programmers naturally use to reason about and communicate their designs. In this proposal and position paper, we argue and provide tentative evidence that this text-centric focus overlooks other forms of prompting GenAI models, such as problem decomposition diagrams functioning as prompts for code generation in their own right enabling new types of programming activities and assessments. To support this position, we present findings from a large introductory Python programming course, where students constructed decomposition diagrams that were used to prompt GPT-4.1 for code generation. We demonstrate that current models are very successful in their ability to generate code from student-constructed diagrams. We conclude by exploring the implications of embracing multimodal prompting for computing education, particularly in the context of assessment.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Priors for ERM over Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14331v2)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study program-learning methods that are efficient in both samples and computation. Classical learning theory suggests that when the target admits a short program description (for example, a short piece of ``Python code''), it can be learned from relatively few examples by performing ERM over the program class. However, this approach relies on enumerating candidate programs, which is typically exponential in the description length. In contrast, gradient-based training avoids explicit search, but for some families of short programs it can require exponentially many samples to succeed. We propose \textsc{LLM-PV}, a propose-and-verify recipe that enables ERM-style selection over a discrete program class without exhaustive enumeration. A pretrained LLM induces a proposal distribution over candidate programs; each proposal is executed, scored on a held-out validation set, and the best program is selected. The method uses no gradient updates and does not use validation feedback to adapt the sampling distribution. Across algorithmic tasks including parity variants, pattern matching, and primality testing, \textsc{LLM-PV} often recovers the exact underlying rule from a small labeled set and generalizes far beyond the training sequence lengths. In the same regimes, SGD-trained transformers and standard adaptation baselines (fine-tuning and in-context learning), as well as classical ML baselines, can fit the training data yet fail to generalize reliably. Together, these results suggest that pretrained LLM priors can serve as effective search biases for ERM, narrowing the gap between statistical and computational efficiency. The code is available at [\href{https://github.com/DLFundamentals/LLM_PV}{code}].</p></details> |  |

These embeddings predict students' skills across multiple programming topics, producing profiles that are matched to the skills required by unseen homework problems. To generate recommendations, we compute the cosine similarity between student profiles and problem skill vectors, ranking exercises according to their alignment with each student's current abilities. We evaluated our approach using real data from students and exercises in an introductory programming course at our university. First, we assessed the effectiveness of our source code embeddings for predicting skills, comparing them with token-based and graph-based alternatives. Results showed that Jina embeddings outperformed TF-IDF, CodeBERT-cpp, and GraphCodeBERT across most skills. Additionally, we evaluated the system's ability to recommend exercises aligned with weekly course content by analyzing student submissions collected over seven course offerings. Our approach consistently produced more suitable recommendations than baselines based on correctness or solution time, indicating that predicted programming skills provide a stronger signal for problem recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 4 figures, to be published in LAK26: 16th International Learning Analytics and Knowledge Conference (LAK 2026)</p></details> |

So far, it has not been explored how various techniques for creating Behavior Tree (BT) program representations could be combined with complete graphical user interfaces (GUIs) to allow a human user to validate and edit trees suggested by automated methods. In this paper, we introduce BEhavior TRee GUI (BETR-GUI) for creating BTs with the help of an AI assistant that combines methods using large language models, planning, genetic programming, and Bayesian optimization with a drag-and-drop editor.

In this paper, we address this gap by formalizing the Program-to-Geometry task, which challenges models to translate programmatic drawing code into accurate and abstract geometric reasoning. To evaluate this capability, we present GeoGramBench, a benchmark of 500 carefully refined problems organized by a tailored three-level taxonomy that considers geometric complexity rather than traditional mathematical reasoning complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier LLMs reveals consistent and pronounced deficiencies: even the most advanced models achieve less than 50% accuracy at the highest abstraction level. These results highlight the unique challenges posed by program-driven spatial reasoning and establish GeoGramBench as a valuable resource for advancing research in symbolic-to-spatial geometric reasoning.

Very recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), an increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed, facilitating software development and maintenance and demonstrating remarkable performance. However, due to ongoing explorations in the LLM-based APR field, it is challenging for researchers to understand the current achievements, challenges, and potential opportunities. This work provides the first systematic literature review to summarize the applications of LLMs in APR between 2020 and 2025. We analyze 189 relevant papers from LLMs, APR and their integration perspectives. First, we categorize existing popular LLMs that are applied to support APR and outline four types of utilization strategies for their deployment. Besides, we detail some specific repair scenarios that benefit from LLMs, e.g., semantic bugs and security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs into APR research, e.g., input forms and open science. Finally, we highlight a set of challenges remaining to be investigated and the potential guidelines for future research. Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to the APR community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of achievements and promote future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM 2026)</p></details> |
| **[On A Parameterized Theory of Dynamic Logic for Operationally-based Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.09307v1)** | 2026-02-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Applying dynamic logics to program verifications is a challenge, because their axiomatic rules for regular expressions can be difficult to be adapted to different program models. We present a novel dynamic logic, called DLp, which supports reasoning based on programs' operational semantics. For those programs whose transitional behaviours are their standard or natural semantics, DLp makes their verifications easier since one can directly apply the program transitions for reasoning, without the need of re-designing and validating new rules as in most other dynamic logics. DLp is parametric. It provides a model-independent framework consisting of a relatively small set of inference rules, which depends on a given set of trustworthy rules for the operational semantics. These features of DLp let multiple models easily compared in its framework and makes it compatible with existing dynamic-logic theories. DLp supports cyclic reasoning, providing an incremental derivation process for recursive programs, making it more convenient to reason about without prior program transformations. We analyze and prove the soundness and completeness of DLp under certain conditions. Several case studies illustrate the features of DLp and fully demonstrate its potential usage.</p></details> |  |
| **[MultiMat: Multimodal Program Synthesis for Procedural Materials using Large Multimodal Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.22151v2)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Material node graphs are programs that generate the 2D channels of procedural materials, including geometry such as roughness and displacement maps, and reflectance such as albedo and conductivity maps. They are essential in computer graphics for representing the appearance of virtual 3D objects parametrically and at arbitrary resolution. In particular, their directed acyclic graph structure and intermediate states enable a modular, interpretable workflow for interactive appearance modeling. However, creating such graphs remains challenging and typically requires professional training. While recent neural program synthesis approaches attempt to simplify this process, they solely represent graphs as textual programs, failing to capture the inherently visual-spatial nature of node graphs that makes them accessible to humans. To address this gap, we present MultiMat, a multimodal program synthesis framework that leverages large multimodal models to process both visual and textual graph representations for improved generation of procedural material graphs. We train our models on a new dataset of production-quality procedural materials and combine them with a constrained tree search inference algorithm that ensures static correctness while efficiently navigating the program space. Our experimental results show that our multimodal program synthesis method is more efficient in both unconditional and conditional graph synthesis with higher visual quality and fidelity than text-only baselines, establishing new state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICLR 2026 (poster)</p></details> |

Typically, researchers study program synthesis via large language models (LLMs) which introduce issues such as knowing what is in or out of distribution, understanding fine-tuning effects, understanding the effects of tokenization, and higher demand on compute and storage to carry out experiments. We present a system called Cadmus which includes an integer virtual machine (VM), a dataset composed of true programs of diverse tasks, and an autoregressive transformer model that is trained for under \$200 of compute cost. The system can be used to study program completion, out-of-distribution representations, inductive reasoning, and instruction following in a setting where researchers have effective and affordable fine-grained control of the training distribution and the ability to inspect and instrument models. Smaller models working on complex reasoning tasks enable instrumentation and investigations that may be prohibitively expensive on larger models. To demonstrate that these tasks are complex enough to be of interest, we show that these Cadmus models outperform GPT-5 (by achieving 100\% accuracy while GPT-5 has 95\% accuracy) even on a simple task of completing correct, integer arithmetic programs in our domain-specific language (DSL) while providing transparency into the dataset's relationship to the problem. We also show that GPT-5 brings unknown priors into its reasoning process when solving the same tasks, demonstrating a confounding factor that prevents the use of large-scale LLMs for some investigations where the training set relationship to the task needs to be fully understood.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable Logical Programming for Quantum Circuit Discovery and Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08880v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing high-fidelity quantum circuits remains challenging, and current paradigms often depend on heuristic, fixed-ansatz structures or rule-based compilers that can be suboptimal or lack generality. We introduce a neuro-symbolic framework that reframes quantum circuit design as a differentiable logic programming problem. Our model represents a scaffold of potential quantum gates and parameterized operations as a set of learnable, continuous ``truth values'' or ``switches,'' $s \in [0, 1]^N$. These switches are optimized via standard gradient descent to satisfy a user-defined set of differentiable, logical axioms (e.g., correctness, simplicity, robustness). We provide a theoretical formulation bridging continuous logic (via T-norms) and unitary evolution (via geodesic interpolation), while addressing the barren plateau problem through biased initialization. We illustrate the approach on tasks including discovery of a 4-qubit Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) from a scaffold of 21 candidate gates. We also report a hardware-aware adaptation experiment on the 133-qubit IBM Torino processor, where the method improved fidelity by 59.3 percentage points in a localized routing task while adapting to hardware failures.</p></details> |  |

While prior works have focused on prompt design and code generation quality, the broader impact of LLM-driven development on the iterative dynamics of software engineering remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct large-scale experiments on thousands of algorithmic programming tasks and hundreds of framework selection tasks to systematically investigate how AI-assisted programming interacts with the software ecosystem. Our analysis quantifies a substantial performance asymmetry: mainstream languages and frameworks achieve significantly higher success rates than niche ones. This disparity suggests a feedback loop consistent with the Matthew Effect, where data-rich ecosystems gain superior AI support. While not the sole driver of adoption, current models introduce a non-negligible productivity friction for niche technologies, representing a hidden bias in software evolution.</p></details> |  |
| **[Specification Vibing for Automated Program Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.08263v1)** | 2026-02-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM)-driven automated program repair (APR) has advanced rapidly, but most methods remain code-centric: they directly rewrite source code and thereby risk hallucinated, behaviorally inconsistent fixes. This limitation suggests the need for an alternative repair paradigm that relies on a representation more accessible to LLMs than raw code, enabling more accurate understanding, analysis, and alignment during repair. To address this gap, we propose VibeRepair, a specification-centric APR technique that treats repair as behavior-specification repair rather than ad-hoc code editing. VibeRepair first translates buggy code into a structured behavior specification that captures the program's intended runtime behavior, then infers and repairs specification misalignments, and finally synthesizes code strictly guided by the corrected behavior specification. An on-demand reasoning component enriches hard cases with program analysis and historical bug-fix evidence while controlling cost. Across Defects4J and real-world benchmarks and multiple LLMs, VibeRepair demonstrates consistently strong repair effectiveness with a significantly smaller patch space. On Defects4J v1.2, VibeRepair correctly repairs 174 bugs, exceeding the strongest state-of-the-art baseline by 28 bugs, which corresponds to a 19% improvement. On Defects4J v2.0, it repairs 178 bugs, outperforming prior approaches by 33 bugs, representing a 23% improvement. Evaluations on real-world benchmarks collected after the training period of selected LLMs further confirm its effectiveness and generalizability. By centering repair on explicit behavioral intent, VibeRepair reframes APR for the era of "vibe" coding: make the behavior sing, and the code will follow.</p></details> |  |

Through systematic analysis of programming language token representations, we characterize how programming languages are encoded in LLM tokenizers by analyzing their vocabulary distribution and keyword coverage patterns. We introduce a novel cold-start probability analysis method that provides insights into model behavior without requiring explicit prompts. Additionally, we present a comprehensive evaluation of how different model optimization techniques - including quantization, distillation, model scaling, and task-specific fine-tuning - affect token-level representations and code generation quality. Our experiments, supported by comprehensive probability distribution analysis and evaluation metrics, reveal critical insights into token-level behavior and provide empirically-validated guidelines for maintaining code generation quality under various optimization constraints. These findings advance both theoretical understanding of LLM code generation and practical implementation of optimized models in production environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 1 figure and 6 tables</p></details> |

Here, we present Grassroots Logic Programs (GLP), a multiagent concurrent logic programming language designed for the implementation of grassroots platforms. We introduce the language incrementally: We recall the standard operational semantics of logic programs; introduce the operational semantics of Concurrent (single-agent) GLP as a restriction of that of LP; recall the notion of multiagent transition systems and atomic transactions; introduce the operational semantics of multiagent GLP via a multiagent transition system specified via atomic transactions; and prove multiagent GLP to be grassroots. The accompanying programming example is the grassroots social graph -- the infrastructure grassroots platform on which all others are based. With the mathematical foundations presented here: a workstation-based implementation of Concurrent GLP was developed by AI, based on the operational semantics of Concurrent GLP; a distributed peer-to-peer smartphone-based implementation of multiagent GLP is being developed by AI, based on the operational semantics of multiagent GLP; a moded type system for GLP was implemented by AI, to facilitate the specification of GLP programs by human and AI designers, for their programming by AI; all reported in detail in companion papers.</p></details> |  |
| **[PBEBench: A Multi-Step Programming by Examples Reasoning Benchmark inspired by Historical Linguistics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23126v4)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although many benchmarks evaluate the reasoning abilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) within domains such as mathematics, coding, or data wrangling, few abstract away from domain specifics to examine reasoning as a capability in and of itself. We contribute a novel type of benchmark evaluating the inductive reasoning capabilities of LLMs that is inspired by the forward reconstruction task from historical linguistics but is formulated in an extremely simple, general way (in the form of Programming by Examples). The task involves generating a cascade of simple string rewrite programs to transform a given list of input strings into a list of desired output strings. We present a fully automated pipeline that programmatically generates problems of this type with controllable difficulty, enabling scalable evaluation of reasoning models while avoiding contamination. Using this approach, we construct two benchmarks: PBEBench-Lite, which efficiently stratifies models of varying capabilities, and PBEBench, which requires models to induce programs similar in complexity to those constructed by historical linguists. Our experiments reveal a substantial performance gap between models that leverage test-time compute or LCoT (long chain-of-thought) reasoning and those that do not. Moreover, although recent models show promise, the solve rate for both of them drops below 5% for hard instances of the PBEBench dataset (ground truth cascade lengths of 20 and 30, respectively), falling well short of realistic historical linguistics requirements even with computationally expensive, popular scaling techniques from the PBE and reasoning literature. Additionally, we also study the effectiveness of different scaling strategies and the impact of various hyperparameters on the difficulty of the generated data using gpt-oss-120b, the best-performing open-source model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Continuous Program Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.07659v1)** | 2026-02-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Genetic Programming yields interpretable programs, but small syntactic mutations can induce large, unpredictable behavioral shifts, degrading locality and sample efficiency. We frame this as an operator-design problem: learn a continuous program space where latent distance has behavioral meaning, then design mutation operators that exploit this structure without changing the evolutionary optimizer. We make locality measurable by tracking action-level divergence under controlled latent perturbations, identifying an empirical trust region for behavior-local continuous variation. Using a compact trading-strategy DSL with four semantic components (long/short entry and exit), we learn a matching block-factorized embedding and compare isotropic Gaussian mutation over the full latent space to geometry-compiled mutation that restricts updates to semantically paired entry--exit subspaces and proposes directions using a learned flow-based model trained on logged mutation outcomes. Under identical $(μ+λ)$ evolution strategies and fixed evaluation budgets across five assets, the learned mutation operator discovers strong strategies using an order of magnitude fewer evaluations and achieves the highest median out-of-sample Sharpe ratio. Although isotropic mutation occasionally attains higher peak performance, geometry-compiled mutation yields faster, more reliable progress, demonstrating that semantically aligned mutation can substantially improve search efficiency without modifying the underlying evolutionary algorithm.</p></details> |  |

Despite remarkable progress, APR is still limited in generating overfitting patches, i.e., patches passing available test suites but incorrect. This issue, known as patch overfitting, has become a key concern in the APR community, with numerous approaches proposed to address it. Very recent work proposes a pre-trained language model (PLM)-based automated patch correctness assessment (APCA) approach, indicating the potential of such PLMs in reasoning about patch correctness. Despite being promising, it is still far from perfect due to various limitations, such as the training paradigm and training dataset. In this paper, we present ComPass, a PLM-based APCA approach that leverages contrastive learning and data augmentation to address the technical limitations of prior work. Our work is inspired by the opportunity to integrate contrastive learning with recent PLMs in the field of patch correctness assessment, where large-scale labeled patches are difficult to obtain. ComPass utilizes code transformation rules to generate semantic-preserving code snippets for both unlabeled pre-training corpus and labeled fine-tuning patches. ComPass then pre-trains PLMs with contrastive learning, which captures code features with the same semantics but different structures. ComPass finally integrates representation embeddings of patch code snippets and fine-tunes PLMs with a binary classifier jointly to assess patch code correctness. Experimental results on 2274 real-world patches from Defects4J demonstrate that ComPass achieves an accuracy of 88.35%, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art baseline APPT.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |

For this reason, their use-cases are restricted to situations where imprecision isn't prohibitive. In this paper, we propose and specify a static analysis that accepts user-supplied program assumptions that are local to program locations. Such assumptions can be used to counteract imprecision in static analyses, enabling their use in a much wider variety of applications. These assumptions are taken by the analyzer non-deterministically, resulting in a function from sets of accepted assumptions to the resulting analysis under those assumptions. We also demonstrate the utility of such a function in two ways, both of which showcase how it can enable optimization over a search space of assumptions that is otherwise infeasible without the specified analysis.</p></details> |  |

When small language models are tasked with generating probabilistic programs, they frequently produce outputs that suffer from both syntactic and semantic errors, such as flawed inference constructs. Motivated by probabilistic programmers' domain expertise and debugging strategies, we introduce RefineStat, a language model--driven framework that enforces semantic constraints ensuring synthesized programs contain valid distributions and well-formed parameters, and then applies diagnostic-aware refinement by resampling prior or likelihood components whenever reliability checks fail. We evaluate RefineStat on multiple probabilistic-programming code-generation tasks using smaller language models (SLMs) and find that it produces programs that are both syntactically sound and statistically reliable, often matching or surpassing those from closed-source large language models (e.g., OpenAI o3).</p></details> | <details><summary>Refin...</summary><p>RefineStat constrains LM decoding with statistical validity checks and uses diagnostic-guided resampling (priors/likelihoods) to transform small LMs' drafts into correct, reliable probabilistic programs that can match or surpass closed-source models</p></details> |

We present a filtering and segmentation algorithm for detecting precipitates in FIB cross-section micrographs, optimized using linear genetic programming (LGP), which accounts for the various artifacts. To this end, the optimization environment uses a domain-specific language for image processing to iterate on solutions. Programs in this language are a list of image-filtering blocks with tunable parameters that sequentially process an input image, allowing for reliable generation and mutation by a genetic algorithm. Our environment produces optimized human-interpretable MATLAB code representing an image filtering pipeline. Under ideal conditions--a population size of 60 and a maximum program length of 5 blocks--our system was able to find a near-human accuracy solution with an average evaluation error of 1.8% when comparing segmentations pixel-by-pixel to a human baseline using an XOR error evaluation. Our automation work enabled faster iteration cycles and furthered exploration of the material composition and processing space: our optimized pipeline algorithm processes a 3.6 megapixel image in about 2 seconds on average. This ultimately enables convergence on strong, low-activation, precipitation hardened copper alloys for additive manufactured fusion reactor parts.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages, 12 figures, 1 table</p></details> |

Existing systems and compiler-based approaches offer reliability but are either heavyweight or support only a limited set of optimizations. Conversely, using LLMs in a per-program optimization methodology can synthesize nontrivial optimizations, but is unreliable, expensive, and offers a low yield. In this work, we introduce a hybrid approach that works in a 3-stage manner that decouples discovery from deployment and connects them via a novel bridge. First, it discovers per-program optimizations (discovery). Second, they are converted into generalised rewrite rules (bridge). Finally, these rules are incorporated into a compiler that can automatically apply them wherever applicable, eliminating repeated reliance on LLMs (deployment). We demonstrate that RuleFlow is the new state-of-the-art (SOTA) Pandas optimization framework on PandasBench, a challenging Pandas benchmark consisting of Python notebooks. Across these notebooks, we achieve a speedup of up to 4.3x over Dias, the previous compiler-based SOTA, and 1914.9x over Modin, the previous systems-based SOTA.

However, a persistent challenge has been to construct highly optimized and often complex designs. This contribution formulates and solves new mixed-integer linear programs that enable consideration of the interplay between environmental impact and constructability. Specifically, the design engineer is enabled to design with multiple materials and/or structural components, apply separate minimum and maximum cross-sectional area bounds, and constrain the complexity of the structural connections. This is done while explicitly considering compatibility and constitutive laws. The results demonstrate that the lowest embodied carbon designs change significantly when constructability constraints are applied, highlighting the need for an integrated optimization approach. In one example, introducing a lower-carbon material option has almost no effect on the environmental performance, whereas another sees an improvement of nearly 29%. The extensibility of the formulation to design with three component types and additional constraints is demonstrated for a prestressed tensegrity example.</p></details> | 38 pages, 23 figures |

In programming classrooms, we aim to leverage its feedback capabilities while reinforcing the educator's role in guiding student-AI interactions. We developed ClassAid, a real-time orchestration system that integrates TA Agents to provide personalized support and an AI-driven dashboard that visualizes student-AI interactions, enabling instructors to dynamically adjust TA Agent modes. Instructors can configure the Agent to provide technical feedback (direct coding solutions), heuristic feedback (hint-based guidance), automatic feedback (autonomously selecting technical or heuristic support), or silent operation (no AI support). We evaluated ClassAid through three aspects: (1) the TA Agents' performance, (2) feedback from 54 students and one instructor during a classroom deployment, and (3) interviews with eight educators. Results demonstrate that dynamic instructor control over AI supports effective real-time personalized feedback and provides design implications for integrating AI into authentic educational settings.</p></details> |  |

While numerous studies address full-full and partial-full 3D shape matching, only a limited number of works have explored the partial-partial setting, very likely due to its unique challenges: we must compute accurate correspondences while at the same time find the unknown overlapping region. Nevertheless, partial-partial 3D shape matching reflects the most realistic setting, as in many real-world cases, such as 3D scanning, shapes are only partially observable. In this work, we introduce the first integer linear programming approach specifically designed to address the distinctive challenges of partial-partial shape matching. Our method leverages geometric consistency as a strong prior, enabling both robust estimation of the overlapping region and computation of neighbourhood-preserving correspondences. We empirically demonstrate that our approach achieves high-quality matching results both in terms of matching error and smoothness. Moreover, we show that our method is more scalable than previous formalisms.</p></details> |  |

Although traditional methods, such as constrained decoding, alleviate this problem by externally rejecting untypable code, the model itself does not effectively learn type reasoning internally, which ultimately limits its overall performance. This paper introduces TyFlow, a novel system that internalizes type reasoning within code generation to guide the model to learn the type system. The core of our approach is a novel type-guided program synthesis system that maintains an isomorphism between type derivation trees and synthesis derivation trees, enabling a new code representation based on synthesis decision sequences rather than traditional text-based token sequences. By offloading the complexity of type system learning to the representation itself, models can redirect their computational resources toward higher-level program semantics. Our evaluation shows that TyFlow not only eliminates type errors but also significantly improves functional correctness, highlighting the importance of aligning LMs with type systems internally.</p></details> |  |

Even beyond the U.S., tax filing requires complex reasoning, combining application of overlapping rules with numerical calculations. Because errors can incur costly penalties, any automated system must deliver high accuracy and auditability, making modern large language models (LLMs) poorly suited for this task. We propose an approach that integrates LLMs with a symbolic solver to calculate tax obligations. We evaluate variants of this system on the challenging StAtutory Reasoning Assessment (SARA) dataset, and include a novel method for estimating the cost of deploying such a system based on real-world penalties for tax errors. We further show how combining up-front translation of plain-text rules into formal logic programs, combined with intelligently retrieved exemplars for formal case representations, can dramatically improve performance on this task and reduce costs to well below real-world averages. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of applying semantic parsing methods to statutory reasoning, and show promising economic feasibility of neuro-symbolic architectures for increasing access to reliable tax assistance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |

In practice, many bug reports convey critical information visually (e.g., layout breakage or missing widgets), but directly using such dense visual inputs often causes context loss and noise, making it difficult for MLLMs to ground visual observations into precise fault localization and executable patches. To bridge this semantic gap, we propose \textbf{SVRepair}, a multimodal APR framework with structured visual representation. SVRepair first fine-tunes a vision-language model, \textbf{Structured Visual Representation (SVR)}, to uniformly transform heterogeneous visual artifacts into a \emph{semantic scene graph} that captures GUI elements and their structural relations (e.g., hierarchy), providing normalized, code-relevant context for downstream repair. Building on the graph, SVRepair drives a coding agent to localize faults and synthesize patches, and further introduces an iterative visual-artifact segmentation strategy that progressively narrows the input to bug-centered regions to suppress irrelevant context and reduce hallucinations. Extensive experiments across multiple benchmarks demonstrate state-of-the-art performance: SVRepair achieves \textbf{36.47\%} accuracy on SWE-Bench M, \textbf{38.02\%} on MMCode, and \textbf{95.12\%} on CodeVision, validating the effectiveness of SVRepair for multimodal program repair.</p></details> | 16 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Does Programming Language Matter? An Empirical Study of Fuzzing Bug Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.05312v1)** | 2026-02-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fuzzing has become a popular technique for automatically detecting vulnerabilities and bugs by generating unexpected inputs. In recent years, the fuzzing process has been integrated into continuous integration workflows (i.e., continuous fuzzing), enabling short and frequent testing cycles. Despite its widespread adoption, prior research has not examined whether the effectiveness of continuous fuzzing varies across programming languages. This study conducts a large-scale cross-language analysis to examine how fuzzing bug characteristics and detection efficiency differ among languages. We analyze 61,444 fuzzing bugs and 999,248 builds from 559 OSS-Fuzz projects categorized by primary language. Our findings reveal that (i) C++ and Rust exhibit higher fuzzing bug detection frequencies, (ii) Rust and Python show low vulnerability ratios but tend to expose more critical vulnerabilities, (iii) crash types vary across languages and unreproducible bugs are more frequent in Go but rare in Rust, and (iv) Python attains higher patch coverage but suffers from longer time-to-detection. These results demonstrate that fuzzing behavior and effectiveness are strongly shaped by language design, providing insights for language-aware fuzzing strategies and tool development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 23rd International Conference on Mining Software Repositories (MSR 2026). 12 pages, 9 figures</p></details> |
| **[What's in a Benchmark? The Case of SWE-Bench in Automated Program Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04449v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid progress in Automated Program Repair (APR) has been fueled by advances in AI, particularly large language models (LLMs) and agent-based systems. SWE-Bench is a benchmark designed to evaluate repair systems using real issues mined from popular open-source Python repositories. Its public leaderboards-SWE-Bench Lite and Verified-have become central platforms for tracking progress and comparing solutions. In this paper, we present the first comprehensive study of these two leaderboards, examining who is submitting solutions, the products behind the submissions, the LLMs employed, and the openness of the approaches. We analyze 79 entries submitted to Lite leaderboard and 133 to Verified. Our results show that most entries on both leaderboards originate from industry, particularly small companies and large publicly traded companies. These submissions often achieve top results, although academic contributions-typically open source-also remain competitive. We also find a clear dominance of proprietary LLMs, especially Claude family, with state-of-the-art results on both leaderboards currently achieved by Claude 4 Sonnet. These findings offer insights into the SWE-Bench ecosystem that can guide greater transparency and diversity in future benchmark-driven research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in 2026 IEEE/ACM 48th International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE-SEIP'26). https://doi.org/10.1145/3786583.3786904</p></details> |
| **[Sparse group principal component analysis via double thresholding with application to multi-cellular programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.04178v1)** | 2026-02-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-cellular programs (MCPs) are coordinated patterns of gene expression across interacting cell types that collectively drive complex biological processes such as tissue development and immune responses. While MCPs are typically estimated from high-dimensional gene expression data using methods like sparse principal component analysis or latent factor models, these approaches often suffer from high computational costs and limited statistical power. In this work, we propose Sparse Group Principal Component Analysis (SGPCA) to estimate MCPs by leveraging their inherent group and individual sparsity. We introduce an efficient double-thresholding algorithm based on power iteration. In each iteration, a group thresholding step first identifies relevant gene groups, followed by an individual thresholding step to select active cell types. This algorithm achieves a linear computational complexity of $O(np)$, making it highly efficient and scalable for large-scale genomic analyses. We establish theoretical guarantees for SGPCA, including statistical consistency and a convergence rate that surpasses competing methods. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that SGPCA achieves superior estimation accuracy and improved statistical power for signal detection. Furthermore, We apply SGPCA to a Lupus study, discovering differentially expressed MCPs distinguishing Lupus patients from normal subjects.</p></details> |  |

We show how to solve integer programs whose matrices have bounded TDM-treewidth when variables are bounded. This extends previous graph-based decomposition parameters for matrices with at most two nonzero entries per row to include matrices with entries outside of $\{-1,0,1\}$. We also give an analogue of the Grid Theorem of Robertson and Seymour for matrices of bounded TDM-treewidth in the language of rooted signed graphs.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Investigating the Influence of Spatial Ability in Augmented Reality-assisted Robot Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03544v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Augmented Reality (AR) offers promising opportunities to enhance learning, but its mechanisms and effects are not yet fully understood. As learning becomes increasingly personalized, considering individual learner characteristics becomes more important. This study investigates the moderating effect of spatial ability on learning experience with AR in the context of robot programming. A between-subjects experiment ($N=71$) compared conventional robot programming to an AR-assisted approach using a head-mounted display. Participants' spatial ability was assessed using the Mental Rotation Test. The learning experience was measured through the System Usability Scale (SUS) and cognitive load. The results indicate that AR support does not significantly improve the learning experience compared to the conventional approach. However, AR appears to have a compensatory effect on the influence of spatial ability. In the control group, spatial ability was significantly positively associated with SUS scores and negatively associated with extraneous cognitive load, indicating that higher spatial ability predicts a better learning experience. In the AR condition, these relationships were not observable, suggesting that AR mitigated the disadvantage typically experienced by learners with lower spatial abilities. These findings suggest that AR can serve a compensatory function by reducing the influence of learner characteristics. Future research should further explore this compensatory role of AR to guide the design of personalized learning environments that address diverse learner needs and reduce barriers for learners with varying cognitive profiles.</p></details> |  |
| **[CP-Agent: Agentic Constraint Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.07468v3)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The translation of natural language to formal constraint models requires expertise in the problem domain and modeling frameworks. To explore the effectiveness of agentic workflows, we propose CP-Agent, a Python coding agent that uses the ReAct framework with a persistent IPython kernel. We provide the relevant domain knowledge as a project prompt of under 50 lines. The algorithm works by iteratively executing code, observing the solver's feedback, and refining constraint models based on execution results. We evaluate CP-Agent on 101 constraint programming problems from CP-Bench. We made minor changes to the benchmark to address systematic ambiguities in the problem specifications and errors in the ground-truth models. On the clarified benchmark, CP-Agent achieves perfect accuracy on all 101 problems. Our experiments show that minimal guidance outperforms detailed procedural scaffolding. Our experiments also show that explicit task management tools can have both positive and negative effects on focused modeling tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Programming for Epistemic Uncertainty in Markov Decision Processes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2602.03381v1)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a general theory of ambiguity-averse MDPs, which treats the uncertain transition probabilities as random variables and evaluates a policy via a risk measure applied to its random return. This ambiguity-averse MDP framework unifies several models of MDPs with epistemic uncertainty for specific choices of risk measures. We extend the concepts of value functions and Bellman operators to our setting. Based on these objects, we establish the consequences of dynamic programming principles in this framework (existence of stationary policies, value and policy iteration algorithms), and we completely characterize law-invariant risk measures compatible with dynamic programming. Our work draws connections among several variants of MDP models and fully delineates what is possible under the dynamic programming paradigm and which risk measures require leaving it.</p></details> |  |
| **[Constraint Matters: Multi-Modal Representation for Reducing Mixed-Integer Linear programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18742v3)** | 2026-02-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction, which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation time by 17.47\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accec...</summary><p>Accecpted by ICLR 2026</p></details> |
