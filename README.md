| **[CodeTF: One-stop Transformer Library for State-of-the-art Code LLMs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.00029v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code intelligence plays a key role in transforming modern software engineering. Recently, deep learning-based models, especially Transformer-based large language models (LLMs), have demonstrated remarkable potential in tackling these tasks by leveraging massive open-source code data and programming language features. However, the development and deployment of such models often require expertise in both machine learning and software engineering, creating a barrier for the model adoption. In this paper, we present CodeTF, an open-source Transformer-based library for state-of-the-art Code LLMs and code intelligence. Following the principles of modular design and extensible framework, we design CodeTF with a unified interface to enable rapid access and development across different types of models, datasets and tasks. Our library supports a collection of pretrained Code LLM models and popular code benchmarks, including a standardized interface to train and serve code LLMs efficiently, and data features such as language-specific parsers and utility functions for extracting code attributes. In this paper, we describe the design principles, the architecture, key modules and components, and compare with other related library tools. Finally, we hope CodeTF is able to bridge the gap between machine learning/generative AI and software engineering, providing a comprehensive open-source solution for developers, researchers, and practitioners.</p></details> |  |

Generative AI tools capable of code generation may support scientific programmers, but user studies indicate risks of over-reliance, particularly among inexperienced users. We surveyed 868 scientists who program, examining adoption patterns, tool preferences, and factors associated with perceived productivity. Adoption is highest among students and less experienced programmers, with variation across fields. Scientific programmers overwhelmingly prefer general-purpose conversational interfaces like ChatGPT over developer-specific tools. Both inexperience and limited use of development practices (like testing, code review, and version control) are associated with greater perceived productivity-but these factors interact, suggesting formal practices may partially compensate for inexperience. The strongest predictor of perceived productivity is the number of lines of generated code typically accepted at once. These findings suggest scientific programmers using generative AI may gauge productivity by code generation rather than validation, raising concerns about research code integrity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Language Boundaries: Uncovering Programming Language Families for Code Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19509v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of diverse programming languages presents both opportunities and challenges for developing multilingual code LLMs. While existing techniques often train code LLMs by simply aggregating multilingual code data, few explore the deeper relationships between programming languages(PLs) and how such relationships can be utilized to optimize the training and inference of code LLMs. In this work, we investigate 2 fundamental questions: 1) What are the deep linguistic relationships among PLs? and 2) How can these relationships be leveraged to improve multilingual code LLMs? We propose an embedding-based framework to uncover the latent families of PLs. Our approach begins by defining 21 primary linguistic features of programming languages, such as variable definition, control structures, and method declarations, and then employs LLMs to generate feature-aligned code samples across multiple languages. By embedding these semantically parallel code snippets from 19 languages, we construct a similarity matrix and perform hierarchical clustering to uncover inherent language relationships. Our analysis reveals clear hierarchical structures among programming languages. Closely related languages form well-defined clusters (e.g., C, C++, Java, and Swift group together), while Go exhibits as a central language with the highest cross-language similarity. Building on the uncovered language families, we propose three strategies to enhance multilingual LLM training: transfer learning across linguistically related languages, linguistic proximity-guided curriculum learning, and centroid-based intermediary code translation. Experiments on 4 code intelligence tasks demonstrate that our methods significantly improve multilingual LLM performance. This work offers a universal perspective on programming languages and advances more effective strategies for multilingual code LLM training.</p></details> | Accepted by FSE 2026 |
| **[A Dataset and Preliminary Study of Using GPT-5 for Code-change Impact Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19481v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding source code changes and their impact on other code entities is a crucial skill in software development. However, the analysis of code changes and their impact is often performed manually and therefore is time-consuming. Recent advancements in AI, and in particular large language models (LLMs) show promises to help developers in various code analysis tasks. However, the extent to which this potential can be utilized for understanding code changes and their impact is underexplored. To address this gap, we study the capabilities of GPT-5 and GPT-5-mini to predict the code entities impacted by given source code changes. We construct a dataset containing information about seed-changes, change pairs, and change types for each commit. Existing datasets lack crucial information about seed changes and impacted code entities. Our experiments evaluate the LLMs in two configurations: (1) seed-change information and the parent commit tree and (2) seed-change information, the parent commit tree, and the diff hunk of each seed change. We found that both LLMs perform poorly in the two experiments, whereas GPT-5 outperforms GPT-5-mini. Furthermore, the provision of the diff hunks helps both models to slightly improve their performance.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[CodeSimpleQA: Scaling Factuality in Code Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19424v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have made significant strides in code generation, achieving impressive capabilities in synthesizing code snippets from natural language instructions. However, a critical challenge remains in ensuring LLMs generate factually accurate responses about programming concepts, technical implementations, etc. Most previous code-related benchmarks focus on code execution correctness, overlooking the factual accuracy of programming knowledge. To address this gap, we present CodeSimpleQA, a comprehensive bilingual benchmark designed to evaluate the factual accuracy of code LLMs in answering code-related questions, which contains carefully curated question-answer pairs in both English and Chinese, covering diverse programming languages and major computer science domains. Further, we create CodeSimpleQA-Instruct, a large-scale instruction corpus with 66M samples, and develop a post-training framework combining supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning. Our comprehensive evaluation of diverse LLMs reveals that even frontier LLMs struggle with code factuality. Our proposed framework demonstrates substantial improvements over the base model, underscoring the critical importance of factuality-aware alignment in developing reliable code LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[PACIFIC: a framework for generating benchmarks to check Precise Automatically Checked Instruction Following In Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10713v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based code assistants have emerged as a powerful application of generative AI, demonstrating impressive capabilities in code generation and comprehension. A key requirement for these systems is their ability to accurately follow user instructions. We present Precise Automatically Checked Instruction Following In Code (PACIFIC), a novel framework designed to automatically generate benchmarks that rigorously assess sequential instruction-following and code dry-running capabilities in LLMs, while allowing control over benchmark difficulty. PACIFIC produces benchmark variants with clearly defined expected outputs, enabling straightforward and reliable evaluation through simple output comparisons. In contrast to existing approaches that often rely on tool usage or agentic behavior, our work isolates and evaluates the LLM's intrinsic ability to reason through code behavior step-by-step without execution (dry running) and to follow instructions. Furthermore, our framework mitigates training data contamination by facilitating effortless generation of novel benchmark variations. We validate our framework by generating a suite of benchmarks spanning a range of difficulty levels and evaluating multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate that PACIFIC can produce increasingly challenging benchmarks that effectively differentiate instruction-following and dry running capabilities, even among advanced models. Overall, our framework offers a scalable, contamination-resilient methodology for assessing core competencies of LLMs in code-related tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Semantically-Equivalent Transformations-Based Backdoor Attacks against Neural Code Models: Characterization and Mitigation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19215v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural code models have been increasingly incorporated into software development processes. However, their susceptibility to backdoor attacks presents a significant security risk. The state-of-the-art understanding focuses on injection-based attacks, which insert anomalous patterns into software code. These attacks can be neutralized by standard sanitization techniques. This status quo may lead to a false sense of security regarding backdoor attacks. In this paper, we introduce a new kind of backdoor attacks, dubbed Semantically-Equivalent Transformation (SET)-based backdoor attacks, which use semantics-preserving low-prevalence code transformations to generate stealthy triggers. We propose a framework to guide the generation of such triggers. Our experiments across five tasks, six languages, and models like CodeBERT, CodeT5, and StarCoder show that SET-based attacks achieve high success rates (often >90%) while preserving model utility. The attack proves highly stealthy, evading state-of-the-art defenses with detection rates on average over 25.13% lower than injection-based counterparts. We evaluate normalization-based countermeasures and find they offer only partial mitigation, confirming the attack's robustness. These results motivate further investigation into scalable defenses tailored to SET-based attacks.</p></details> |  |
| **[University Rents Enabling Corporate Innovation: Mapping Academic Researcher Coding and Discursive Labour in the R Language Ecosystem](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19153v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article explores the role of unrecognised labour in corporate innovation systems via an analysis of researcher coding and discursive contributions to R, one of the largest statistical software ecosystems. Studies of online platforms typically focus on how platform affordances constrain participants' actions, and profit from their labour. We innovate by connecting the labour performed inside digital platforms to the professional employment of participants. Our case study analyses 8,924 R package repositories on GitHub, examining commits and communications. Our quantitative findings show that researchers, alongside non-affiliated contributors, are the most frequent owners of R package repositories and their most active contributors. Researchers are more likely to hold official roles compared to the average, and to engage in collaborative problem-solving and support work during package development. This means there is, underneath the 'recognised' category of star researchers who transition between academia and industry and secure generous funding, an 'unrecognised' category of researchers who not only create and maintain key statistical infrastructure, but also provide support to industry employees, for no remuneration. Our qualitative findings show how this unrecognised labour affects practitioners. Finally, our analysis of the ideology and practice of free, libre and open source software (FLOSS) shows how this ideology and practice legitimate the use of 'university rents' by Big Tech.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Equilibrium Convolutional Sparse Coding for Hyperspectral Image Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15553v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral images (HSIs) play a crucial role in remote sensing but are often degraded by complex noise patterns. Ensuring the physical property of the denoised HSIs is vital for robust HSI denoising, giving the rise of deep unfolding-based methods. However, these methods map the optimization of a physical model to a learnable network with a predefined depth, which lacks convergence guarantees. In contrast, Deep Equilibrium (DEQ) models treat the hidden layers of deep networks as the solution to a fixed-point problem and models them as infinite-depth networks, naturally consistent with the optimization. Under the framework of DEQ, we propose a Deep Equilibrium Convolutional Sparse Coding (DECSC) framework that unifies local spatial-spectral correlations, nonlocal spatial self-similarities, and global spatial consistency for robust HSI denoising. Within the convolutional sparse coding (CSC) framework, we enforce shared 2D convolutional sparse representation to ensure global spatial consistency across bands, while unshared 3D convolutional sparse representation captures local spatial-spectral details. To further exploit nonlocal self-similarities, a transformer block is embedded after the 2D CSC. Additionally, a detail enhancement module is integrated with the 3D CSC to promote image detail preservation. We formulate the proximal gradient descent of the CSC model as a fixed-point problem and transform the iterative updates into a learnable network architecture within the framework of DEQ. Experimental results demonstrate that our DECSC method achieves superior denoising performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[BanglaForge: LLM Collaboration with Self-Refinement for Bangla Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19122v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Bangla is a low-resource language for code generation, lacking large-scale annotated datasets and tools to transform natural language specifications into executable programs. This makes Bangla-to-code generation a challenging task requiring innovative solutions. To address this, we introduce BanglaForge, a novel framework for generating code from Bangla function descriptions. BanglaForge leverages a retrieval-augmented dual-model collaboration paradigm with self-refinement, combining in-context learning, llm-based translation, systematic prompt engineering, and iterative self-refinement based on execution feedback, where a coder generates initial solutions and a reviewer enhances them for robustness. On the BLP-2025 Bangla Code Generation benchmark, BanglaForge achieves a competitive Pass@1 accuracy of 84.00%, demonstrating the effectiveness of retrieval, model collaboration, and self-refinement for low-resource Bangla code generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at BLP Workshop @ IJCNLP-AACL 2025.

| **[Modular Layout Synthesis (MLS): Front-end Code via Structure Normalization and Constrained Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18996v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated front-end engineering drastically reduces development cycles and minimizes manual coding overhead. While Generative AI has shown promise in translating designs to code, current solutions often produce monolithic scripts, failing to natively support modern ecosystems like React, Vue, or Angular. Furthermore, the generated code frequently suffers from poor modularity, making it difficult to maintain. To bridge this gap, we introduce Modular Layout Synthesis (MLS), a hierarchical framework that merges visual understanding with structural normalization. Initially, a visual-semantic encoder maps the screen capture into a serialized tree topology, capturing the essential layout hierarchy. Instead of simple parsing, we apply heuristic deduplication and pattern recognition to isolate reusable blocks, creating a framework-agnostic schema. Finally, a constraint-based generation protocol guides the LLM to synthesize production-ready code with strict typing and component props. Evaluations show that MLS significantly outperforms existing baselines, ensuring superior code reusability and structural integrity across multiple frameworks</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatic Detection of LLM-Generated Code: A Comparative Case Study of Contemporary Models Across Function and Class Granularities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.01382v2)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The adoption of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation risks incorporating vulnerable code into software systems. Existing detectors face two critical limitations: a lack of systematic cross-model validation and opaque "black box" operation. We address this through a comparative study of code generated by four distinct LLMs: GPT-3.5, Claude 3 Haiku, Claude Haiku 4.5, and GPT-OSS. Analyzing 14,485 Python functions and 11,913 classes from the CodeSearchNet dataset, we generated corresponding code with all four LLMs. Using interpretable software metrics, we trained CatBoost classifiers for each configuration. Our analysis reveals that granularity effects dominate model differences by a factor of 8.6, with negligible feature overlap, indicating that function-level and class-level detection rely on fundamentally disjoint structural signatures. We discover critical granularity-dependent inversions: while modern models (Claude, GPT-OSS) are more detectable at the class level, GPT-3.5 is an anomaly that uniquely excels at the function level. SHAP analysis identifies the Comment-to-Code Ratio as the sole universal discriminator. However, its predictive magnitude varies drastically across models, explaining why detectors trained on specific LLMs fail to generalize. Our findings demonstrate that GPT-3.5's exceptional detectability (AUC-ROC 0.96) is unrepresentative of contemporary models (AUC-ROC approximately between 0.68 and 0.80). Robust detection requires moving beyond single-model studies to account for substantial diversity in structural fingerprints across architectures and granularities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to a journal for potential publication</p></details> |
| **[An Empirical Study of Developer-Provided Context for AI Coding Assistants in Open-Source Projects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18925v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities, research shows that their effectiveness depends not only on explicit prompts but also on the broader context provided. This requirement is especially pronounced in software engineering, where the goals, architecture, and collaborative conventions of an existing project play critical roles in response quality. To support this, many AI coding assistants have introduced ways for developers to author persistent, machine-readable directives that encode a project's unique constraints. Although this practice is growing, the content of these directives remains unstudied. This paper presents a large-scale empirical study to characterize this emerging form of developer-provided context. Through a qualitative analysis of 401 open-source repositories containing cursor rules, we developed a comprehensive taxonomy of project context that developers consider essential, organized into five high-level themes: Conventions, Guidelines, Project Information, LLM Directives, and Examples. Our study also explores how this context varies across different project types and programming languages, offering implications for the next generation of context-aware AI developer tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[EuroHPC SPACE CoE: Redesigning Scalable Parallel Astrophysical Codes for Exascale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18883v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High Performance Computing (HPC) based simulations are crucial in Astrophysics and Cosmology (A&C), helping scientists investigate and understand complex astrophysical phenomena. Taking advantage of exascale computing capabilities is essential for these efforts. However, the unprecedented architectural complexity of exascale systems impacts legacy codes. The SPACE Centre of Excellence (CoE) aims to re-engineer key astrophysical codes to tackle new computational challenges by adopting innovative programming paradigms and software (SW) solutions. SPACE brings together scientists, code developers, HPC experts, hardware (HW) manufacturers, and SW developers. This collaboration enhances exascale A&C applications, promoting the use of exascale and post-exascale computing capabilities. Additionally, SPACE addresses high-performance data analysis for the massive data outputs from exascale simulations and modern observations, using machine learning (ML) and visualisation tools. The project facilitates application deployment across platforms by focusing on code repositories and data sharing, integrating European astrophysical communities around exascale computing with standardised SW and data protocols.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Code2Doc: A Quality-First Curated Dataset for Code Documentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18748v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The performance of automatic code documentation generation models depends critically on the quality of the training data used for supervision. However, most existing code documentation datasets are constructed through large scale scraping of public repositories with limited quality control. As a result, they often contain noisy documentation, extensive duplication, and increasing contamination from AI generated content. These issues weaken the supervision signal available to learning-based models and complicate evaluation. We introduce \textbf{Code2Doc}, a quality-first curated dataset for function-level code documentation generation. Code2Doc consists of 13,358 high-quality function-documentation pairs extracted from widely used open-source repositories spanning five programming languages: Python, Java, TypeScript, JavaScript, and C++. The dataset is constructed using a four-stage curation pipeline that enforces documentation completeness and clarity, filters functions based on structural and complexity criteria, removes exact and near-duplicate code, and identifies documentation likely to be AI generated. Starting from 52,069 extracted candidates, only 25.6 percent satisfy all quality constraints. We provide a detailed analysis of the resulting dataset, which achieves a mean documentation quality score of 6.93 out of 10. Overall, 86.9% of samples contain explicit type annotations, and only 2.9\% are flagged as potentially AI generated. Baseline experiments show that fine-tuning a large language model on Code2Doc yields relative improvements of 29.47% in BLEU and 24.04% in ROUGE-L over zero shot performance, despite the modest dataset size. We release both the dataset and the full curation pipeline to support reproducible research on automatic code documentation generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Insight into Security Code Review with LLMs: Capabilities, Obstacles, and Influential Factors](https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16310v5)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Security code review is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process typically requiring integration with automated security defect detection tools. However, existing security analysis tools struggle with poor generalization, high false positive rates, and coarse detection granularity. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been considered promising candidates for addressing those challenges. In this study, we conducted an empirical study to explore the potential of LLMs in detecting security defects during code review. Specifically, we evaluated the performance of seven LLMs under five different prompts and compared them with state-of-the-art static analysis tools. We also performed linguistic and regression analyses for the two top-performing LLMs to identify quality problems in their responses and factors influencing their performance. Our findings show that: (1) In security code review, LLMs significantly outperform state-of-the-art static analysis tools, and the reasoning-optimized LLM performs better than general-purpose LLMs. (2) DeepSeek-R1 achieves the highest performance, followed by GPT-4. The optimal prompt for DeepSeek-R1 incorporates both the commit message and chain-of-thought (CoT) guidance, while for GPT-4, the prompt with a Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) list works best. (3) GPT-4 frequently produces vague expressions and exhibits difficulties in accurately following instructions in the prompts, while DeepSeek-R1 more commonly generates inaccurate code details in its outputs. (4) LLMs are more adept at identifying security defects in code files that have fewer tokens and security-relevant annotations.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 10 images, 8 tables, Manuscript revision submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[A Survey of Vibe Coding with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12399v2)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm shift from code generation assistance to autonomous coding agents, enabling a novel development methodology termed "Vibe Coding" where developers validate AI-generated implementations through outcome observation rather than line-by-line code comprehension. Despite its transformative potential, the effectiveness of this emergent paradigm remains under-explored, with empirical evidence revealing unexpected productivity losses and fundamental challenges in human-AI collaboration. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive and systematic review of Vibe Coding with large language models, establishing both theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this transformative development approach. Drawing from systematic analysis of over 1000 research papers, we survey the entire vibe coding ecosystem, examining critical infrastructure components including LLMs for coding, LLM-based coding agent, development environment of coding agent, and feedback mechanisms. We first introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a Constrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic relationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing practices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation, Iterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and Context-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in this domain. Critically, our analysis reveals that successful Vibe Coding depends not merely on agent capabilities but on systematic context engineering, well-established development environments, and human-agent collaborative development models.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI Code in the Wild: Measuring Security Risks and Ecosystem Shifts of AI-Generated Code in Modern Software](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18567v1)** | 2025-12-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) for code generation are becoming integral to modern software development, but their real-world prevalence and security impact remain poorly understood. We present the first large-scale empirical study of AI-generated code (AIGCode) in the wild. We build a high-precision detection pipeline and a representative benchmark to distinguish AIGCode from human-written code, and apply them to (i) development commits from the top 1,000 GitHub repositories (2022-2025) and (ii) 7,000+ recent CVE-linked code changes. This lets us label commits, files, and functions along a human/AI axis and trace how AIGCode moves through projects and vulnerability life cycles. Our measurements show three ecological patterns. First, AIGCode is already a substantial fraction of new code, but adoption is structured: AI concentrates in glue code, tests, refactoring, documentation, and other boilerplate, while core logic and security-critical configurations remain mostly human-written. Second, adoption has security consequences: some CWE families are overrepresented in AI-tagged code, and near-identical insecure templates recur across unrelated projects, suggesting "AI-induced vulnerabilities" propagated by shared models rather than shared maintainers. Third, in human-AI edit chains, AI introduces high-throughput changes while humans act as security gatekeepers; when review is shallow, AI-introduced defects persist longer, remain exposed on network-accessible surfaces, and spread to more files and repositories. We will open-source the complete dataset and release analysis artifacts and fine-grained documentation of our methodology and findings.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/sI_LKPnA-BeCVYr9Ko4sqg https://github.com/Narwhal-Lab/aicode-in-the-wild-security-risk-report</p></details> |

Yet existing secure coding datasets fall short. They lack incident grounding, don't provide the scale modern training requires, and miss the operational security context developers need for production deployments. We present SecureCode v2.0, a production-grade dataset of 1,215 security-focused coding examples that passed structural validation and expert security review. Every example ties to actual documented security incidents with CVE references, provides vulnerable and secure implementations, demonstrates concrete attacks, and includes defense-in-depth operational guidance. The dataset covers 11 vulnerability categories (complete OWASP Top 10:2025 plus AI/ML Security Threats) across 11 languages (Python, JavaScript, Java, Go, PHP, C#, TypeScript, Ruby, Rust, Kotlin, and YAML for infrastructure-as-code). Our quality assurance framework ensures complete incident grounding. Each example includes SIEM integration strategies, infrastructure hardening recommendations (Docker, AppArmor, WAF configurations), and testing approaches using language-appropriate frameworks. The dataset uses a 4-turn conversational structure mirroring actual developer-AI interactions, escalating from basic implementations to advanced security considerations and defense-in-depth guidance. Our contributions: (1) 1,215 rigorously validated examples split into 989 training, 122 validation, and 104 test sets, (2) an automated validation framework ensuring dataset consistency, (3) a 4-turn conversational structure capturing realistic security workflows, (4) comprehensive operational security guidance with SIEM integration strategies, (5) complete language-specific implementation fidelity, and (6) open-source release of data, validation tools, and benchmarking protocols.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 5 figures.

However, real-world software engineering is fundamentally a long-horizon endeavor: developers must interpret high-level requirements, plan coordinated changes across many files, and evolve codebases over multiple iterations while preserving existing functionality. We introduce SWE-EVO, a benchmark that evaluates agents on this long-horizon software evolution challenge. Constructed from release notes and version histories of seven mature open-source Python projects, Tool comprises 48 evolution tasks that require agents to implement multi-step modifications spanning an average of 21 files, validated against comprehensive test suites averaging 874 tests per instance. Experiments with state-of-the-art models reveal a striking capability gap: even GPT-5 with OpenHands achieves only a 21 percent resolution rate on Tool, compared to 65 percent on the single-issue SWE-Bench Verified. This demonstrates that current agents struggle with sustained, multi-file reasoning. We also propose Fix Rate, a fine-grained metric that captures partial progress toward solving these complex, long-horizon tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Configuration-First Framework for Reproducible, Low-Code Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25692v2)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning is increasingly permeating radio-based localization services. To keep results credible and comparable, everyday workflows should make rigorous experiment specification and exact repeatability the default, without blocking advanced experimentation. However, in practice, researchers face a three-way gap that could be filled by a framework that offers (i) low coding effort for end-to-end studies, (ii) reproducibility by default, including versioned code, data, and configurations, controlled randomness, isolated runs, and recorded artifacts, and (iii) built-in extensibility so new models, metrics, and stages can be added with minimal integration effort. Existing tools rarely deliver all three for machine learning in general and localization workflows in particular. In this paper, we introduce LOCALIZE, a low-code, configuration-first framework for radio localization in which experiments are declared in human-readable configuration files, a workflow orchestrator executes standardized pipelines from data preparation to reporting, and all artifacts, such as datasets, models, metrics, and reports, are versioned. Preconfigured, versioned datasets reduce initial setup effort and boilerplate, thereby accelerating model development and evaluation. The design, with explicit extension points, allows experts to add components without reworking the underlying infrastructure. Through a qualitative comparison and a head-to-head study against a plain Jupyter notebook baseline, we show that the framework reduces authoring effort while maintaining comparable runtime and memory behavior. Furthermore, using a Bluetooth Low Energy dataset, we demonstrate that scaling the training data from 1x to 10x keeps orchestration overheads bounded as data grows. Overall, the framework makes reproducible machine-learning-based localization experimentation practical, accessible, and extensible.</p></details> | 12 pages, 7 figures |

| **[A Reinforcement Learning Environment for Automatic Code Optimization in the MLIR Compiler](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.11068v2)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code optimization is a crucial task that aims to enhance code performance. However, this process is often tedious and complex, highlighting the necessity for automatic code optimization techniques. Reinforcement Learning (RL) has emerged as a promising approach for tackling such complex optimization problems. In this project, we introduce MLIR RL, an RL environment for the MLIR compiler, dedicated to facilitating MLIR compiler research and enabling automatic code optimization. We propose a multi-discrete formulation of the action space where the action space is the Cartesian product of simpler action subspaces. We also propose a new method, called level pointers, to reduce the size of the action space related to the loop interchange transformation. This enables more efficient and effective learning of the policy. To demonstrate the effectiveness of MLIR RL, we train an RL agent to optimize MLIR Linalg code, targeting CPU. The code is generated from two domain-specific frameworks: deep-learning models generated from PyTorch, and LQCD (Lattice Quantum Chromodynamics) code generated from an LQCD compiler. The result of this work is a research environment that allows the community to experiment with novel ideas in RL-driven loop-nest optimization.</p></details> |  |

| **[Implementing Transport Coding in OMNeT++ for Message Delay Reduction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18332v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transport coding reduces message delay in packet-switched networks by introducing controlled redundancy at the transport layer: $k$ original packets are encoded into $n\ge k$ coded packets, and the message is reconstructed after the first $k$ successful deliveries, effectively shifting latency from the maximum packet delay to the $k$-th order statistic. We present a concise, reproducible discrete-event implementation of transport coding in OMNeT++, including a multi-hop Kleinrock-type network, FIFO queues, exponential service and link delays, and explicit receiver-side reconstruction that records message delay and deadline violations. Using paired uncoded ($n{=}k$) and coded ($n{>}k$) configurations at the same message generation rate, we compare delay, reliability, and saturation effects across code rates and input loads. Simulation results show consistent reductions of average delay and late-delivery probability for moderate redundancy, while keeping the saturation throughput close to the uncoded baseline. The proposed model provides a transparent bridge between analytical transport-coding formulas and executable simulation for tuning redundancy in low-latency services.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeNER: Code Prompting for Named Entity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20423v3)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have explored various approaches for treating candidate named entity spans as both source and target sequences in named entity recognition (NER) by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Although previous approaches have successfully generated candidate named entity spans with suitable labels, they rely solely on input context information when using LLMs, particularly, ChatGPT. However, NER inherently requires capturing detailed labeling requirements with input context information. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that leverages code-based prompting to improve the capabilities of LLMs in understanding and performing NER. By embedding code within prompts, we provide detailed BIO schema instructions for labeling, thereby exploiting the ability of LLMs to comprehend long-range scopes in programming languages. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed code-based prompting method outperforms conventional text-based prompting on ten benchmarks across English, Arabic, Finnish, Danish, and German datasets, indicating the effectiveness of explicitly structuring NER instructions. We also verify that combining the proposed code-based prompting method with the chain-of-thought prompting further improves performance.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Confucius Code Agent: Scalable Agent Scaffolding for Real-World Codebases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10398v5)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world software engineering tasks require coding agents that can operate over massive repositories, sustain long-horizon sessions, and reliably coordinate complex toolchains at test time. Existing research-grade coding agents offer transparency but struggle when scaled to heavier, production-level workloads, while production-grade systems achieve strong practical performance but provide limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We introduce the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), a software engineering agent that can operate at large-scale codebases. CCA is built on top of the Confucius SDK, an agent development platform structured around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK integrates a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension system for reliable tool use. In addition, we introduce a meta-agent that automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated with these mechanisms, CCA demonstrates strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA reaches a Resolve@1 of 54.3%, exceeding prior research baselines and comparing favorably to commercial results, under identical repositories, model backends, and tool access.</p></details> | The latest version |
| **[Making Strong Error-Correcting Codes Work Effectively for HBM in AI Inference](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.18152v1)** | 2025-12-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM inference is increasingly memory bound, and HBM cost per GB dominates system cost. Current HBM stacks include short on-die ECC that tightens binning, raises price, and fixes reliability policy inside the device. This paper asks whether a system can tolerate a much higher raw HBM bit error rate and still keep end-to-end correctness and throughput, without changing the HBM PHY or the fixed 32 B transaction size. We propose REACH, a controller managed ECC design that keeps the HBM link and 32 B transfers unchanged. REACH uses a two level Reed-Solomon scheme: each 32 B chunk uses an inner code to check and correct most faults locally, while chunks that cannot be fixed are marked as erasures. An outer code spans kilobytes and runs in erasure only mode, repairing only flagged chunks and avoiding the expensive locator step. For small random writes, REACH updates outer parity with differential parity to avoid recomputing parity over the whole span, and an optional importance adaptive bit plane policy can protect only critical fields such as BF16 exponents to reduce ECC work and traffic. On three LLMs at 8K context, REACH keeps about 79 percent of on-die ECC throughput at zero BER and remains qualified up to a raw BER of 1e-3, extending tolerable device error rates by about three orders of magnitude while keeping tokens per second nearly flat. In ASAP7, a full REACH controller occupies 15.2 mm2 and consumes 17.5 W at 3.56 TB/s, and it reduces ECC area by 11.6x and power by about 60 percent compared to a naive long Reed-Solomon baseline. By moving strong ECC into the controller, REACH turns long code reliability into a system choice that can enable lower cost HBM under the same standard interface.</p></details> |  |

Using a dataset of 944 real-world LeetCode problems across five programming languages, we assess model performance using rigorous metrics: compile-time errors, runtime errors, functional failures, and algorithmic suboptimalities. The results reveal significant performance variations, with DeepSeek-R1 and GPT-4.1 consistently outperform others in terms of correctness, efficiency, and robustness. Through detailed case studies, we identify common failure scenarios such as syntax errors, logical flaws, and suboptimal algorithms, highlighting the critical role of prompt engineering and human oversight in improving results. Based on these findings, we provide actionable recommendations for developers and practitioners, emphasizing that successful LLM deployment depends on careful model selection, effective prompt design, and context-aware usage to ensure reliable code generation in real-world software development tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 9 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

A description of the implementation is also provided, with details for the pseudo-Hermitian case. Timing and memory utilization are analyzed on both CPU and GPU clusters.

However, poorly integrating them in source code may undermine software system quality. Yet, to our knowledge, there is no formal catalog of code smells specific to coding practices for LLM inference. In this paper, we introduce the concept of LLM code smells and formalize five recurrent problematic coding practices related to LLM inference in software systems, based on relevant literature. We extend the detection tool SpecDetect4AI to cover the newly defined LLM code smells and use it to validate their prevalence in a dataset of 200 open-source LLM systems. Our results show that LLM code smells affect 60.50% of the analyzed systems, with a detection precision of 86.06%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted paper at ICSE NIER 2026 : https://conf.researchr.org/track/icse-2026/icse-2026-nier</p></details> |
| **[A Causal Perspective on Measuring, Explaining and Mitigating Smells in LLM-Generated Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15817v4)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated their adoption in software engineering contexts. However, concerns persist about the structural quality of the code they produce. In particular, LLMs often replicate poor coding practices, introducing code smells (i.e., patterns that hinder readability, maintainability, or design integrity). Although prior research has examined the detection or repair of smells, we still lack a clear understanding of how and when these issues emerge in generated code. This paper addresses this gap by systematically measuring, explaining and mitigating smell propensity in LLM-generated code. We build on the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), a probabilistic metric that estimates the likelihood of generating particular smell types, and establish its robustness as a signal of structural quality. Using PSC as an instrument for causal analysis, we identify how generation strategy, model size, model architecture and prompt formulation shape the structural properties of generated code. Our findings show that prompt design and architectural choices play a decisive role in smell propensity and motivate practical mitigation strategies that reduce its occurrence. A user study further demonstrates that PSC helps developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality, providing evidence that smell propensity signals can support human judgement. Taken together, our work lays the groundwork for integrating quality-aware assessments into the evaluation and deployment of LLMs for code.</p></details> |  |

This solves the problem for the optimal parameters of additive codes when the minimum distance is large and yields many infinite series of additive codes that outperform linear codes.</p></details> | <details><summary>181 p...</summary><p>181 pages, 27 tables, typos removed, content extended; comments more than welcome</p></details> |

To address this, we propose Specification-Grounded Code Review (SGCR), a framework that grounds LLMs in human-authored specifications to produce trustworthy and relevant feedback. SGCR features a novel dual-pathway architecture: an explicit path ensures deterministic compliance with predefined rules derived from these specifications, while an implicit path heuristically discovers and verifies issues beyond those rules. Deployed in a live industrial environment at HiThink Research, SGCR's suggestions achieved a 42% developer adoption rate-a 90.9% relative improvement over a baseline LLM (22%). Our work demonstrates that specification-grounding is a powerful paradigm for bridging the gap between the generative power of LLMs and the rigorous reliability demands of software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Voxel-GS: Quantized Scaffold Gaussian Splatting Compression with Run-Length Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17528v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Substantial Gaussian splatting format point clouds require effective compression. In this paper, we propose Voxel-GS, a simple yet highly effective framework that departs from the complex neural entropy models of prior work, instead achieving competitive performance using only a lightweight rate proxy and run-length coding. Specifically, we employ a differentiable quantization to discretize the Gaussian attributes of Scaffold-GS. Subsequently, a Laplacian-based rate proxy is devised to impose an entropy constraint, guiding the generation of high-fidelity and compact reconstructions. Finally, this integer-type Gaussian point cloud is compressed losslessly using Octree and run-length coding. Experiments validate that the proposed rate proxy accurately estimates the bitrate of run-length coding, enabling Voxel-GS to eliminate redundancy and optimize for a more compact representation. Consequently, our method achieves a remarkable compression ratio with significantly faster coding speeds than prior art. The code is available at https://github.com/zb12138/VoxelGS.</p></details> | Accepted by DCC 2026 |

Existing benchmarks primarily assess correctness through test-case execution, offering limited insight into how reliably models follow such constraints. We introduce a benchmark of 1,000 Python tasks, each paired with an average of 7 developer-specified constraints spanning 13 categories. Constraints are curated through a four-stage human-LLM pipeline to ensure they are atomic, relevant, and objective. We evaluate 14 open- and closed-source models using complementary adherence metrics and propose the C2A Score, a composite measure that jointly captures correctness and constraint compliance. Results reveal a substantial gap between partial and strict satisfaction, while strong models achieve over 90% partial adherence, strict adherence remains between 39-66%. These findings highlight that trustworthy code generation requires not only correctness but also consistent adherence to developer intent.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 22 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

However, their effectiveness heavily relies on supervised training with extensive labeled (e.g., question-answering pairs) or unlabeled datasets (e.g., code snippets), which are often expensive and difficult to obtain at scale. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a method IPC, an unsupervised framework that leverages Internal Probing of LLMs for Code generation without any external corpus, even unlabeled code snippets. We introduce the problem space probing, test understanding probing, solution space probing, and knowledge consolidation and reinforcement to probe the internal knowledge and confidence patterns existing in LLMs. Further, IPC identifies reliable code candidates through self-consistency mechanisms and representation-based quality estimation to train UCoder (coder with unsupervised learning). We validate the proposed approach across multiple code benchmarks, demonstrating that unsupervised methods can achieve competitive performance compared to supervised approaches while significantly reducing the dependency on labeled data and computational resources. Analytic experiments reveal that internal model states contain rich signals about code quality and correctness, and that properly harnessing these signals enables effective unsupervised learning for code generation tasks, opening new directions for training code LLMs in resource-constrained scenarios.</p></details> |  |

Each case is abstracted into a JSON graph and embedded using a lightweight three-layer GCN trained with contrastive learning. The nearest validated reference is injected into a structured prompt that constrains code generation, while a verifier closes the loop by executing the candidate configuration and feeding failures back to the agent. On 628 validation cases, GraphCue achieves an 88.2 percent pass rate within 20 iterations and completes 95 percent of verification loops within 9 seconds. Ablation studies without retrieval or structured prompting perform substantially worse, indicating that topology-aware retrieval and constraint-based conditioning are key drivers of performance.</p></details> | 2 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Cryptanalysis of Pseudorandom Error-Correcting Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17310v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pseudorandom error-correcting codes (PRC) is a novel cryptographic primitive proposed at CRYPTO 2024. Due to the dual capability of pseudorandomness and error correction, PRC has been recognized as a promising foundational component for watermarking AI-generated content. However, the security of PRC has not been thoroughly analyzed, especially with concrete parameters or even in the face of cryptographic attacks. To fill this gap, we present the first cryptanalysis of PRC. We first propose three attacks to challenge the undetectability and robustness assumptions of PRC. Among them, two attacks aim to distinguish PRC-based codewords from plain vectors, and one attack aims to compromise the decoding process of PRC. Our attacks successfully undermine the claimed security guarantees across all parameter configurations. Notably, our attack can detect the presence of a watermark with overwhelming probability at a cost of $2^{22}$ operations. We also validate our approach by attacking real-world large generative models such as DeepSeek and Stable Diffusion. To mitigate our attacks, we further propose three defenses to enhance the security of PRC, including parameter suggestions, implementation suggestions, and constructing a revised key generation algorithm. Our proposed revised key generation function effectively prevents the occurrence of weak keys. However, we highlight that the current PRC-based watermarking scheme still cannot achieve a 128-bit security under our parameter suggestions due to the inherent configurations of large generative models, such as the maximum output length of large language models.</p></details> |  |

While research has focused on improving the tools and understanding developer perceptions, a critical gap exists in understanding how developers actually use these tools in their daily workflows, and, crucially, where they struggle. This paper addresses part of this gap through a multi-phased investigation of developer interactions with an LLM-powered code editing feature, Transform Code, in an IDE widely used at Google. First, we analyze telemetry logs of the feature usage, revealing that frequent re-prompting can be an indicator of developer struggles with using Transform Code. Second, we conduct a qualitative analysis of unsatisfactory requests, identifying five key categories of information often missing from developer prompts. Finally, based on these findings, we propose and evaluate a tool, AutoPrompter, for automatically improving prompts by inferring missing information from the surrounding code context, leading to a 27% improvement in edit correctness on our test set.</p></details> |  |

More is known when the inner product is Euclidean than Hermitian. A shift to the latter is gaining traction. The focus is on a code whose Hermitian hull dimension and dual distance can be systematically determined. Such a code can serve as an ingredient in designing the parameters of entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs). We use tools from algebraic function fields of one variable to efficiently determine a good lower bound on the Hermitian hull dimensions of generalized rational algebraic geometry (AG) codes. We identify families of AG codes whose hull dimensions can be well estimated by a lower bound. Given such a code, the idea is to select a set of evaluation points for which the residues of the Weil differential associated with the Hermitian dual code has an easily verifiable property. The approach allows us to construct codes with designed Hermitian hull dimensions based on known results on Reed-Solomon codes and their generalization. Using the Hermitian method on these maximum distance separable (MDS) codes with designed hull dimensions yields two families of MDS EAQECCs. We confirm that the excellent parameters of the quantum codes from these families are new.</p></details> | 23 pages |

Validating the functional equivalence of translation and repairing, if necessary, are critical steps in code translation. Existing automated validation and repair approaches struggle to generalize to many PLs due to high engineering overhead, and they rely on existing and often inadequate test suites, which results in false claims of equivalence and ineffective translation repair. We develop MatchFixAgent, a large language model (LLM)-based, PL-agnostic framework for equivalence validation and repair of translations. MatchFixAgent features a multi-agent architecture that divides equivalence validation into several sub-tasks to ensure thorough and consistent semantic analysis of the translation. Then it feeds this analysis to test agent to write and execute tests. Upon observing a test failure, the repair agent attempts to fix the translation bug. The final (in)equivalence decision is made by the verdict agent, considering semantic analyses and test execution results. We compare MatchFixAgent's validation and repair results with four repository-level code translation techniques. We use 2,219 translation pairs from their artifacts, which cover 6 PL pairs, and are collected from 24 GitHub projects totaling over 900K lines of code. Our results demonstrate that MatchFixAgent produces (in)equivalence verdicts for 99.2% of translation pairs, with the same equivalence validation result as prior work on 72.8% of them. When MatchFixAgent's result disagrees with prior work, we find that 60.7% of the time MatchFixAgent's result is actually correct. In addition, we show that MatchFixAgent can repair 50.6% of inequivalent translation, compared to prior work's 18.5%. This demonstrates that MatchFixAgent is far more adaptable to many PL pairs than prior work, while producing highly accurate validation results.</p></details> |  |

SATD is known to significantly increase software maintenance effort. While extensive research has examined SATD in source code, its presence and impact in test code have received no focused attention, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of how SATD manifests in testing contexts. This study, the first of its kind, investigates SATD in test code by manually analyzing 50,000 comments randomly sampled from 1.6 million comments across 1,000 open-source Java projects. From this sample, after manual analysis and filtering, we identified 615 SATD comments and classified them into 14 distinct categories, building a taxonomy of test code SATD. To investigate whether test code SATD can be detected automatically, we evaluated existing SATD detection tools, as well as both open-source and proprietary LLMs. Among the existing tools, MAT performed the best, albeit with moderate recall. To our surprise, both open-source and proprietary LLMs exhibited poor detection accuracy, primarily due to low precision. These results indicate that neither existing approaches nor current LLMs can reliably detect SATD in test code. Overall, this work provides the first large-scale analysis of SATD in test code, a nuanced understanding of its types, and the limitations of current SATD detection methods. Our findings lay the groundwork for future research on test code-specific SATD.</p></details> |  |

While modern C++ standards and frameworks like OpenMP and MPI have simplified parallelism, mastering these paradigms is still complex. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating code generation, but their effectiveness in producing correct and efficient HPC code is not well understood. In this work, we systematically evaluate leading LLMs including ChatGPT 4 and 5, Claude, and LLaMA on the task of generating C++ implementations of the Mandelbrot set using shared-memory, directive-based, and distributed-memory paradigms. Each generated program is compiled and executed with GCC 11.5.0 to assess its correctness, robustness, and scalability.

In the coding domain, manually examining the quality of LLM-generated content is extremely challenging, as it requires understanding long chunks of raw code and deliberately simulating code execution. To this end, we introduce BigCodeArena, an open human evaluation platform for code generation backed by a comprehensive and on-the-fly execution environment. Built on top of Chatbot Arena, BigCodeArena enables the execution of LLM-generated code and allows humans to interact with the execution process and outcomes. We collected over 14,000 raw code-centric conversation sessions across 10 widely used LLMs, spanning 10 languages and 8 types of execution environments. Among these conversations, we identified more than 4,700 multi-turn samples with pairwise human preferences. Further analysis uncovers underexplored preferences of LLMs in fine-grained domains characterized by tasks, languages, and frameworks. To systematically examine code understanding and generation capabilities of frontier LLMs, we curated two benchmarks based on the collected data, namely BigCodeReward and AutoCodeArena. For BigCodeReward, we post-processed the 4,700 conversations and evaluated the consistency between reward models and human preferences. The evaluation shows that most LLMs have superior performance in judging coding preferences when the execution results are available. Inspired by these findings, we propose AutoCodeArena, an automatic Elo rating benchmark designed to assess the coding quality of LLMs without human involvement. We find that proprietary LLMs like GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Claude-Opus-4 still lead in code generation performance among recent emerging models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Built...</summary><p>Built with love by the BigCode community :)</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Rate Coding: Surrogate Gradients Enable Spike Timing Learning in Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16043v3)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The surrogate gradient descent algorithm enabled spiking neural networks to be trained to carry out challenging sensory processing tasks, an important step in understanding how spikes contribute to neural computations. However, it is unclear the extent to which these algorithms fully explore the space of possible spiking solutions to problems. We investigated whether spiking networks trained with surrogate gradient descent can learn to make use of information that is only encoded in the timing and not the rate of spikes. We constructed synthetic datasets with a range of types of spike timing information (interspike intervals, spatio-temporal spike patterns or polychrony, and coincidence codes). We find that surrogate gradient descent training can extract all of these types of information. In more realistic speech-based datasets, both timing and rate information is present. We therefore constructed variants of these datasets in which all rate information is removed, and find that surrogate gradient descent can still perform well. We tested all networks both with and without trainable axonal delays. We find that delays can give a significant increase in performance, particularly for more challenging tasks. To determine what types of spike timing information are being used by the networks trained on the speech-based tasks, we test these networks on time-reversed spikes which perturb spatio-temporal spike patterns but leave interspike intervals and coincidence information unchanged. We find that when axonal delays are not used, networks perform well under time reversal, whereas networks trained with delays perform poorly. This suggests that spiking neural networks with delays are better able to exploit temporal structure. To facilitate further studies of temporal coding, we have released our modified speech-based datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Study of Code Obfuscation Against LLM-based Vulnerability Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16538v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for code vulnerability detection, their reliability and robustness across diverse vulnerability types have become a pressing concern. In traditional adversarial settings, code obfuscation has long been used as a general strategy to bypass auditing tools, preserving exploitability without tampering with the tools themselves. Numerous efforts have explored obfuscation methods and tools, yet their capabilities differ in terms of supported techniques, granularity, and programming languages, making it difficult to systematically assess their impact on LLM-based vulnerability detection. To address this gap, we provide a structured systematization of obfuscation techniques and evaluate them under a unified framework. Specifically, we categorize existing obfuscation methods into three major classes (layout, data flow, and control flow) covering 11 subcategories and 19 concrete techniques. We implement these techniques across four programming languages (Solidity, C, C++, and Python) using a consistent LLM-driven approach, and evaluate their effects on 15 LLMs spanning four model families (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Qwen, and LLaMA), as well as on two coding agents (GitHub Copilot and Codex). Our findings reveal both positive and negative impacts of code obfuscation on LLM-based vulnerability detection, highlighting conditions under which obfuscation leads to performance improvements or degradations. We further analyze these outcomes with respect to vulnerability characteristics, code properties, and model attributes. Finally, we outline several open problems and propose future directions to enhance the robustness of LLMs for real-world vulnerability detection.</p></details> |  |

The disconnect between rapid adoption and limited conceptual understanding highlights the need for an inquiry into this emerging paradigm. Drawing on an intent perspective and historical analysis, we define vibe coding as a software development paradigm where humans and Generative AI (GenAI) engage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural language dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from deterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. By intent mediation, we refer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their conceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute. Our results show that vibe coding redistributes epistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting expertise from technical implementation toward collaborative orchestration. We identify key opportunities, including democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage, alongside risks such as black-box codebases, responsibility gaps, and ecosystem bias. We conclude with a research agenda spanning human-, technology-, and organization-centered directions to guide future investigations of this paradigm.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoDFBench 1.0: A Benchmarking Framework for Digital Forensic Tool Testing and Generated Code Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16965v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Computer Forensic Tool Testing (CFTT) programme has become the de facto standard for providing digital forensic tool testing and validation. However to date, no comprehensive framework exists to automate benchmarking across the diverse forensic tasks included in the programme. This gap results in inconsistent validation, challenges in comparing tools, and limited validation reproducibility. This paper introduces AutoDFBench 1.0, a modular benchmarking framework that supports the evaluation of both conventional DF tools and scripts, as well as AI-generated code and agentic approaches. The framework integrates five areas defined by the CFTT programme: string search, deleted file recovery, file carving, Windows registry recovery, and SQLite data recovery. AutoDFBench 1.0 includes ground truth data comprising of 63 test cases and 10,968 unique test scenarios, and execute evaluations through a RESTful API that produces structured JSON outputs with standardised metrics, including precision, recall, and F1~score for each test case, and the average of these F1~scores becomes the AutoDFBench Score. The benchmarking framework is validated against CFTT's datasets. The framework enables fair and reproducible comparison across tools and forensic scripts, establishing the first unified, automated, and extensible benchmarking framework for digital forensic tool testing and validation. AutoDFBench 1.0 supports tool vendors, researchers, practitioners, and standardisation bodies by facilitating transparent, reproducible, and comparable assessments of DF technologies.</p></details> |  |

In coding theory terms we are dealing with additive codes that have a large $f$th generalized Hamming weight. We also consider the dual problem of the minimum number $b_q(r,h,f;s)$ of $(h-1)$-spaces in $\operatorname{PG}(r-1,q)$ such that each subspace of codimension $f$ contains at least $s$ elements. We fully determine $b_2(5,2,2;s)$ as a function of $s$.

Although naturally complementary, these two information streams are highly heterogeneous in both paradigm and reasoning, making it difficult for existing methods to unify them or effectively model their cross-level interactions. To address this gap, we propose ForenAgent, a multi-round interactive IFD framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and iteratively refine Python-based low-level tools around the detection objective, thereby achieving more flexible and interpretable forgery analysis. ForenAgent follows a two-stage training pipeline combining Cold Start and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning to enhance its tool interaction capability and reasoning adaptability progressively. Inspired by human reasoning, we design a dynamic reasoning loop comprising global perception, local focusing, iterative probing, and holistic adjudication, and instantiate it as both a data-sampling strategy and a task-aligned process reward. For systematic training and evaluation, we construct FABench, a heterogeneous, high-quality agent-forensics dataset comprising 100k images and approximately 200k agent-interaction question-answer pairs. Experiments show that ForenAgent exhibits emergent tool-use competence and reflective reasoning on challenging IFD tasks when assisted by low-level tools, charting a promising route toward general-purpose IFD. The code will be released after the review process is completed.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Long-Horizon Visual Imitation Learning via Plan and Code Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05368v3)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from long-horizon demonstrations with complex action sequences presents significant challenges for visual imitation learning, particularly in understanding temporal relationships of actions and spatial relationships between objects. In this paper, we propose a new agent framework that incorporates two dedicated reflection modules to enhance both plan and code generation. The plan generation module produces an initial action sequence, which is then verified by the plan reflection module to ensure temporal coherence and spatial alignment with the demonstration video. The code generation module translates the plan into executable code, while the code reflection module verifies and refines the generated code to ensure correctness and consistency with the generated plan. These two reflection modules jointly enable the agent to detect and correct errors in both the plan generation and code generation, improving performance in tasks with intricate temporal and spatial dependencies. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce LongVILBench, a benchmark comprising 300 human demonstrations with action sequences of up to 18 steps. LongVILBench emphasizes temporal and spatial complexity across multiple task types. Experimental results demonstrate that existing methods perform poorly on this benchmark, whereas our new framework establishes a strong baseline for long-horizon visual imitation learning.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |

While this field has garnered considerable attention, the exploration of testing and evaluating the robustness of code generation models remains an ongoing endeavor. Previous studies have primarily focused on code generation models specifically for the Python language, overlooking other widely-used programming languages. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis to assess the robustness performance of several prominent code generation models and investigate whether robustness can be improved by repairing perturbed docstrings using an LLM. Furthermore, we investigate how their performance varies across different programming languages. To accomplish this, we introduce perturbations in four key areas of the prompt: DocString, functionname, syntax, and format. We have compiled and released a dedicated dataset for this purpose. This work presents our experimental findings, shedding light on the performance of code generation models in various scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 10 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |

The same holds when the alphabet is a finite field $\mathbb{F}$, the code is $\mathbb{F}$-linear, and the $2$-query tester is $\mathbb{F}$-linear. We show that those are essentially the only limitations on the existence of good locally testable codes (LTCs). That is, there are good $2$-query LTCs on any alphabet with more than $2$ letters, and good $3$-query LTCs with a binary alphabet. Similarly, there are good $3$-query $\mathbb{F}$-linear LTCs, and for every $\mathbb{F}$-vector space $V$ of dimension greater than $1$, there are good $2$-query LTCs with alphabet $V$ whose tester is $\mathbb{F}$-linear. This completely solves, for every $q\geq 2$ and alphabet (resp. $\mathbb{F}$-vector space) $Σ$, the question of whether there is a good $q$-query LTC (resp. $\mathbb{F}$-LTC) with alphabet $Σ$. Our proof builds on the recent good $2$-query $\mathbb{F}$-LTCs of the first author and Kaufman, by establishing a general method for reducing the alphabet size of a low-query LTC.</p></details> | <details><summary>19 pa...</summary><p>19 pages.

Deflation can be seen as a generalization of the well-known puncturing and shortening techniques in cases where more than a single qudit is removed. We show that the parameters of the deflated quantum code can be controlled, and argue that a similar approach is not as beneficial when applied to classical linear codes. Furthermore, it is shown that deflation introduces additional freedom compared to applying just puncturing and shortening consecutively. We exemplify that it is possible to obtain better parameters by deflating a code rather than consecutively using puncturing and shortening.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE transactions on information theory November 21, 2025</p></details> |

Our beam search decoder applies to all quantum LDPC codes and achieves different speed-accuracy tradeoffs by tuning its parameters such as the beam width. We perform numerical simulations under circuit level noise for the $[[144, 12, 12]]$ bivariate bicycle (BB) code at noise rate $p=10^{-3}$ to estimate the logical error rate and the 99.9 percentile runtime and we compare with the BP-OSD decoder which has been the default quantum LDPC decoder for the past six years. A variant of our beam search decoder with a beam width of 64 achieves a $17\times$ reduction in logical error rate. With a beam width of 8, we reach the same logical error rate as BP-OSD with a $26.2\times$ reduction in the 99.9 percentile runtime. We identify the beam search decoder with beam width of 32 as a promising candidate for trapped ion architectures because it achieves a $5.6\times$ reduction in logical error rate with a 99.9 percentile runtime per syndrome extraction round below 1ms at $p=5 \times10^{-4}$. Remarkably, this is achieved in software on a single core, without any parallelization or specialized hardware (FPGA, ASIC), suggesting one might only need three 32-core CPUs to decode a trapped ion quantum computer with 1000 logical qubits.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have released the implementation source code at https://github.com/ionq-publications/BeamSearchDecoder</p></details> |
| **[Bidirectional predictive coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23415v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive coding (PC) is an influential computational model of visual learning and inference in the brain. Classical PC was proposed as a top-down generative model, where the brain actively predicts upcoming visual inputs, and inference minimises the prediction errors. Recent studies have also shown that PC can be formulated as a discriminative model, where sensory inputs predict neural activities in a feedforward manner. However, experimental evidence suggests that the brain employs both generative and discriminative inference, while unidirectional PC models show degraded performance in tasks requiring bidirectional processing. In this work, we propose bidirectional PC (bPC), a PC model that incorporates both generative and discriminative inference while maintaining a biologically plausible circuit implementation. We show that bPC matches or outperforms unidirectional models in their specialised generative or discriminative tasks, by developing an energy landscape that simultaneously suits both tasks. We also demonstrate bPC's superior performance in two biologically relevant tasks including multimodal learning and inference with missing information, suggesting that bPC resembles biological visual inference more closely.</p></details> |  |

This raises concerns about intellectual property compliance and the potential unauthorized use of license-restricted code. While membership inference (MI) techniques have been proposed to detect such unauthorized usage, their effectiveness can be undermined by semantically equivalent code transformation techniques, which modify code syntax while preserving semantic. In this work, we systematically investigate whether semantically equivalent code transformation rules might be leveraged to evade MI detection. The results reveal that model accuracy drops by only 1.5% in the worst case for each rule, demonstrating that transformed datasets can effectively serve as substitutes for fine-tuning. Additionally, we find that one of the rules (RenameVariable) reduces MI success by 10.19%, highlighting its potential to obscure the presence of restricted code. To validate these findings, we conduct a causal analysis confirming that variable renaming has the strongest causal effect in disrupting MI detection. Notably, we find that combining multiple transformations does not further reduce MI effectiveness. Our results expose a critical loophole in license compliance enforcement for training large language models for code, showing that MI detection can be substantially weakened by transformation-based obfuscation techniques.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |

Existing evaluation methods for code review generation either rely on automatic comparisons to a single ground truth, which fails to capture the variability of human perspectives, or on subjective assessments of "usefulness", a highly ambiguous concept. We propose a novel evaluation approach based on what we call multi-subjective ranking. Using a dataset of 280 self-contained code review requests and corresponding comments from CodeReview StackExchange, multiple human judges ranked the quality of ChatGPT-generated comments alongside the top human responses from the platform. Results show that ChatGPT's comments were ranked significantly better than human ones, even surpassing StackExchange's accepted answers. Going further, our proposed method motivates and enables more meaningful assessments of generative AI's performance in code review, while also raising awareness of potential risks of unchecked integration into review processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repli...</summary><p>Replication Package: https://github.com/robert-heumueller-ovgu/repl-generative-review-relevance</p></details> |

However, due to the difficulty in effectively evaluating intermediate algorithmic steps and the inability to locate and timely correct erroneous steps, these methods often generate incorrect code and incur increased computational costs. To tackle these problems, we propose RPM-MCTS, an effective method that utilizes Knowledge-Retrieval as Process Reward Model based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to evaluate intermediate algorithmic steps. By utilizing knowledge base retrieval, RPM-MCTS avoids the complex training of process reward models. During the expansion phase, similarity filtering is employed to remove redundant nodes, ensuring diversity in reasoning paths. Furthermore, our method utilizes sandbox execution feedback to locate erroneous algorithmic steps during generation, enabling timely and targeted corrections. Extensive experiments on four public code generation benchmarks demonstrate that RPM-MCTS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods while achieving an approximately 15% reduction in token consumption. Furthermore, full fine-tuning of the base model using the data constructed by RPM-MCTS significantly enhances its code capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Despite the well-established correlation between audio and lip movements, this cross-modal coherence has not been systematically exploited for compression. To address this, we propose an Audio-Visual Cross-Modal Compression (AVCC) framework that jointly compresses audio and video streams. Our framework extracts motion information from video and tokenizes audio features, then aligns them through a unified audio-video diffusion process. This allows synchronized reconstruction of both modalities from a shared representation. In extremely low-rate scenarios, AVCC can even reconstruct one modality from the other. Experiments show that AVCC significantly outperforms the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard and state-of-the-art GFVC schemes in rate-distortion performance, paving the way for more efficient multimodal communication systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a PAPER and for publication in the DCC 2026 proceedings</p></details> |
| **[Feature Importance-Aware Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Computationally Efficient and Adjustable Image Transmission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04758v3)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (deepJSCC) have substantially improved communication performance, but their high computational cost hinders practical deployment. Moreover, certain applications require the ability to dynamically adapt computational complexity. To address these issues, we propose a Feature Importance-Aware deepJSCC (FAJSCC) model for image transmission that is both computationally efficient and adjustable. FAJSCC employs axis-dimension specialized computation, which performs efficient operations individually for each spatial and channel axis, significantly reducing computational cost while representing features effectively. It further incorporates selective deformable self-attention, which applies self-attention only to selected and adaptively adjusted features, leveraging the importance and relations of input features to efficiently capture complex feature correlations. Another key feature of FAJSCC is that the number of selected important areas can be controlled separately by the encoder and the decoder, depending on the available computational budget. It makes FAJSCC the first deepJSCC architecture to allow independent adjustment of encoder and decoder complexity within a single trained model. Experimental results show that FAJSCC achieves superior image transmission performance under various channel conditions while requiring less computational complexity than recent state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, experiments independently varying the encoder and decoder's computational resources reveal, for the first time in the deepJSCC literature, that understanding the meaning of noisy features in the decoder demands the greatest computational cost. The code is publicly available at github.com/hansung-choi/FAJSCCv2.</p></details> |  |

The correctness of generated code is influenced by the prompt used to query the given base LLM. We formulate the problem of finding the appropriate prompt as combinatorial search process and propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) approach referred to as {\em BO for Code GENeration (BODE-GEN)}. BODE-GEN performs an adaptive data-driven search over prompts guided by training data in the form of prompts tried and the functional accuracy of the generated code over a set of given test cases. The key insight is to perform BO in continuous embedding space by using an auxiliary LLM to bridge the gap between discrete prompt space and continuous embedding space. We leverage two synergistic ideas, namely, random projections and dimensionality scaled priors, to build effective Gaussian process based surrogate models over the high-dimensional embedding space. Our experiments on the HumanEval+ benchmark using multiple base LLMs show that BODE-GEN can improve performance in terms of code generation accuracy compared to fixed prompts and manual prompt engineering. Additionally, we demonstrate that BODE-GEN is sample-efficient, requiring relatively few iterations of BO to demonstrate improvements in code accuracy.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |
| **[On the Stochastic Analysis of Random Linear Streaming Codes in Multi-Hop Relay Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15049v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we aim to explore the stochastic performance limit of large-field-size Random Linear Streaming Codes (RLSCs) in multi-hop relay networks. In our model, a source transmits a sequence of streaming messages to a destination through multiple relays subject to a delay constraint. Most previous research focused on deterministic adversarial channel which introduces only restricted types of erasure patterns, and aimed to design the optimal capacity-achieving codes. In this paper, we focus on stochastic channel where each hop is subject to i.i.d. packet erasures, and carry out stochastic analysis on the error probability of multi-hop RLSCs. Our contributions are three-folds. Firstly, the error event of large-field-size RLSCs is characterized in two-hop relay network with a novel framework, which features quantification of information flowing through each node in the network. Due to the erasures in different hops, some source symbols can be "detained" at the source or relay while others have arrived at the destination. By iteratively computing the number of detained symbols at each node, this framework extends the concept "information debt" from point-to-point network [Pinwen Su et al. 2022] into two-hop relay networks. Secondly, based on the error event, the expression of average error probability in two-hop network is derived by carefully analyzing the expectation terms. To handle the expectation over all possible erasure patterns along two hops of the network, the transition matrices of the detained symbols are novelly constructed in a "band fashion" with nested structure. Thirdly, the derived results in two-hop network are further generalized into relay networks with arbitrary number of hops. Furthermore, simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of our stochastic analysis, and compare with some existing streaming codes for the adversarial channels.</p></details> |  |

| **[Evaluating Code Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models Under Real-World Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14917v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code reasoning tasks are becoming prevalent in large language model (LLM) assessments. Existing benchmarks involve simple programs, failing to represent real-world complexities such as inter- or intra-procedural dependencies, core or third-party API calls, highly nested constructs, and non-primitive complex types. Evaluating LLMs under such a simplistic setting poses a significant threat to assumptions about their generalizability in practice. To enable a more realistic evaluation of code reasoning, this paper proposes RE2-Bench, a benchmark of 1,101 reasoning problems, including 195 drawn from mature real-world projects. RE2-Bench leverages static and dynamic program analysis to automatically serialize and deserialize compound, complex, and custom types in real-world code, going far beyond the primitive-only settings used in prior work. A key feature of RE2-Bench is categorizing each reasoning problem as Easy or Hard via a principled majority-vote mechanism over nine interpretable code complexity metrics, resulting in two well-separated and semantically meaningful difficulty categories suitable for precise calibration of LLM reasoning ability. A comprehensive evaluation of six general-purpose and reasoning-oriented LLMs on two widely used code reasoning tasks -- input prediction and output prediction -- using RE2-Bench reveals a significant performance drop from Easy to Hard problems (51.50\% for input prediction and 42.15\% for output prediction), confirming that prior evaluations substantially overestimate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Manually identifying such vulnerabilities is tedious. Meanwhile, static security scanners tend to produce many false positives. While machine learning-based approaches are promising, they typically perform well only in scenarios where training and test data are closely related. A key challenge for ML-based vulnerability detection is providing suitable and concise code context, as excessively long contexts negatively affect the code comprehension capabilities of machine learning models, particularly smaller ones. This work introduces Trace Gadgets, a novel code representation that minimizes code context by removing non-related code. Trace Gadgets precisely capture the statements that cover the path to the vulnerability. As input for ML models, Trace Gadgets provide a minimal but complete context, thereby improving the detection performance. Moreover, we collect a large-scale dataset generated from real-world applications with manually curated labels to further improve the performance of ML-based vulnerability detectors. Our results show that state-of-the-art machine learning models perform best when using Trace Gadgets compared to previous code representations, surpassing the detection capabilities of industry-standard static scanners such as GitHub's CodeQL by at least 4% on a fully unseen dataset. By applying our framework to real-world applications, we identify and report previously unknown vulnerabilities in widely deployed software.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of ACM ASIA CCS 2026</p></details> |

However, developing cloud-of-things (CoT) applications remains challenging. It requires significant technical expertise and lacks standardized, model-driven methodologies. Current approaches fail to ensure interoperability, automation, and efficiency. This study introduces the Model of Things (MoT), a model-based approach that incorporates low-code principles to simplify CoT development. MoT reduces technical barriers by providing a custom UML profile designed for IoT and cloud services. To evaluate MoT, we conducted a case study and a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire. The results confirmed MoT's feasibility, demonstrating that it streamlines CoT application development and deployment. Users found MoT accessible, even with limited IoT experience, and reported high perceived ease of use and usefulness.

Many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the performance of such code translators. However, previous benchmarks mostly provide fine-grained samples, focusing at either code snippet, function, or file-level code translation. Such benchmarks do not accurately reflect real-world demands, where entire repositories often need to be translated, involving longer code length and more complex functionalities. To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, named RepoTransBench, which is a real-world multilingual repository-level code translation benchmark featuring 1,897 real-world repository samples across 13 language pairs with automatically executable test suites. Besides, we introduce RepoTransAgent, a general agent framework to perform repository-level code translation. We evaluate both our benchmark's challenges and agent's effectiveness using several methods and backbone LLMs, revealing that repository-level translation remains challenging, where the best-performing method achieves only a 32.8% success rate. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that translation difficulty varies significantly by language pair direction, with dynamic-to-static language translation being much more challenging than the reverse direction (achieving below 10% vs. static-to-dynamic at 45-63%). Finally, we conduct a detailed error analysis and highlight current LLMs' deficiencies in repository-level code translation, which could provide a reference for further improvements. We provide the code and data at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/RepoTransBench.</p></details> |  |

The platform independence offered through Wasm makes it an attractive solution for many different applications that can run on disparate infrastructures. In addition, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are offered in many computing infrastructures, which allows also running security sensitive Wasm workloads independent of the specific platforms offered. However, recent work has shown that Wasm binaries are more sensitive to code confidentiality attacks than native binaries. The previous result was obtained for Intel SGX only. In this paper, we take this one step further, introducing a new Wasm code-confidentiality attack that exploits exposed address-space information in TEEs. Our attack enables the extraction of crucial execution features which, when combined with additional side channels, allows us to with high reliability obtain more than 70% of the code in most cases. This is a considerably larger amount than was previously obtained by single stepping Intel SGX where only upwards to 50% of the code could be obtained.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 Pa...</summary><p>10 Pages, 1 Table, 5 Figures</p></details> |

These new bounds give upper bounds on the length of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes, codes which attain the Singleton bound. We will also consider codes to be MDS if they attain the fractional Singleton bound, due to Huffman. We prove that this bound in the fractional case can be obtained by codes whose length surpasses the length of the longest known codes in the integral case. For small parameters, we provide exhaustive computational results for additive MDS codes, by classifying the corresponding (fractional) subspace-arcs. This includes a complete classification of fractional additive MDS codes of size 243 over the field of order 9.</p></details> |  |

Stabiliser codes were introduced as a means to protect information when storing or applying computations in Hilbert spaces where the local dimension is fixed, i.e. in Hilbert spaces of the form $({\mathbb C}^D)^{\otimes n}$. If $D$ is a prime power then one can consider stabiliser codes over finite fields \cite{KKKS2006}, which allows a deeper mathematical structure to be used to develop stabiliser codes. However, there is no practical reason that the subsystems should have the same local dimension and in this article we introduce a stabiliser formalism for mixed dimensional Hilbert spaces, i.e. of the form ${\mathbb C}^{D_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes {\mathbb C}^{D_n}$. More generally, we define and prove a Singleton bound for quantum error-correcting codes of mixed dimensional Hilbert spaces. We redefine entanglement measures for these Hilbert spaces and follow \cite{HESG2018} and define absolutely maximally entangled states as states which maximise this entanglement measure. We provide examples of absolutely maximally entangled states in spaces of dimensions not previously known to have absolutely maximally entangled states.</p></details> |  |

These codes are derived from quadratic forms through a bivariate construction. We completely determine their complete weight enumerators and weight hierarchies by employing exponential sums. Most of these codes are minimal and some are optimal in the sense that they meet the Griesmer bound. Furthermore, we also establish the weight hierarchies of $\mathcal{C}_{Q,N}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{Q,N}'$, which are the descended codes of $\mathcal{C}_{Q}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{Q}'$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Intention Chain-of-Thought Prompting with Dynamic Routing for Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14048v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) exhibit strong generative capabilities and have shown great potential in code generation. Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting methods enhance model reasoning by eliciting intermediate steps, but suffer from two major limitations: First, their uniform application tends to induce overthinking on simple tasks. Second, they lack intention abstraction in code generation, such as explicitly modeling core algorithmic design and efficiency, leading models to focus on surface-level structures while neglecting the global problem objective. Inspired by the cognitive economy principle of engaging structured reasoning only when necessary to conserve cognitive resources, we propose RoutingGen, a novel difficulty-aware routing framework that dynamically adapts prompting strategies for code generation. For simple tasks, it adopts few-shot prompting; for more complex ones, it invokes a structured reasoning strategy, termed Intention Chain-of-Thought (ICoT), which we introduce to guide the model in capturing task intention, such as the core algorithmic logic and its time complexity. Experiments across three models and six standard code generation benchmarks show that RoutingGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in most settings, while reducing total token usage by 46.37% on average across settings. Furthermore, ICoT outperforms six existing prompting baselines on challenging benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI-2026</p></details> |

However, fine-tuning these models on private datasets can raise privacy and proprietary concerns, such as the leakage of sensitive personal information. Differentially private (DP) code generation provides theoretical guarantees for protecting sensitive code by generating synthetic datasets that preserve statistical properties while reducing privacy leakage concerns. However, DP code generation faces significant challenges due to the strict syntactic dependencies and the privacy-utility trade-off. We propose PrivCode, the first DP synthesizer specifically designed for code datasets. It incorporates a two-stage framework to improve both privacy and utility. In the first stage, termed "privacy-sanitizing", PrivCode generates DP-compliant synthetic code by training models using DP-SGD while introducing syntactic information to preserve code structure. The second stage, termed "utility-boosting", fine-tunes a larger pre-trained LLM on the synthetic privacy-free code to mitigate the utility loss caused by DP, enhancing the utility of the generated code. Extensive experiments on four LLMs show that PrivCode generates higher-utility code across various testing tasks under four benchmarks. The experiments also confirm its ability to protect sensitive data under varying privacy budgets. We provide the replication package at the anonymous link.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NDSS 2026; code available at https://github.com/Liuzzyg/PrivCode</p></details> |
| **[PerfCoder: Large Language Models for Interpretable Code Performance Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14018v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in automatic code generation, yet their ability to produce high-performance code remains limited--a critical requirement in real-world software systems. We argue that current LLMs struggle not only due to data scarcity but, more importantly, because they lack supervision that guides interpretable and effective performance improvements. In this work, we introduce PerfCoder, a family of LLMs specifically designed to generate performance-enhanced code from source code via interpretable, customized optimizations. PerfCoder is fine-tuned on a curated collection of real-world optimization trajectories with human-readable annotations, and preference-aligned by reinforcement fine-tuning using runtime measurements, enabling it to propose input-specific improvement strategies and apply them directly without relying on iterative refinement. On the PIE code performance benchmark, PerfCoder surpasses all existing models in both runtime speedup and effective optimization rate, demonstrating that performance optimization cannot be achieved by scale alone but requires optimization stratetgy awareness. In addition, PerfCoder can generate interpretable feedback about the source code, which, when provided as input to a larger LLM in a planner-and-optimizer cooperative workflow, can further improve outcomes. Specifically, we elevate the performance of 32B models and GPT-5 to new levels on code optimization, substantially surpassing their original performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Professional Software Developers Don't Vibe, They Control: AI Agent Use for Coding in 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14012v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of AI agents is transforming how software can be built. The promise of agents is that developers might write code quicker, delegate multiple tasks to different agents, and even write a full piece of software purely out of natural language. In reality, what roles agents play in professional software development remains in question. This paper investigates how experienced developers use agents in building software, including their motivations, strategies, task suitability, and sentiments. Through field observations (N=13) and qualitative surveys (N=99), we find that while experienced developers value agents as a productivity boost, they retain their agency in software design and implementation out of insistence on fundamental software quality attributes, employing strategies for controlling agent behavior leveraging their expertise. In addition, experienced developers feel overall positive about incorporating agents into software development given their confidence in complementing the agents' limitations. Our results shed light on the value of software development best practices in effective use of agents, suggest the kinds of tasks for which agents may be suitable, and point towards future opportunities for better agentic interfaces and agentic use guidelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Workflows vs Agents for Code Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14762v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating algorithms from high-level languages like MATLAB to hardware description languages (HDLs) is a resource-intensive but necessary step for deployment on FPGAs and ASICs. While large language models (LLMs) offer a path to automation, their limited training on HDL code makes end-to-end transpilation brittle and prone to syntax errors. We compare two LLM-driven methods for syntax repair in a MATLAB-to-HDL pipeline: a structured, expert-designed flow that follows a fixed sequence of operations, and a more autonomous agentic approach that uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) \cite{anthropic2024mcp} to dynamically select its own tools. We study 42 MATLAB signal-processing functions and isolate the syntax-repair stage. Across three model scales, the agentic approach is more effective at resolving initial syntax errors, unblocking a greater number of candidates to proceed through the pipeline. This upstream improvement yields measurable downstream improvements, most notably on mid-sized models, where it increases the simulation reach rate by over 20 percentage points. We hypothesize the gains come from short prompts, aggressive context management, and conditional tool use. Conditional retrieval helps at 8B and 30B; at 235B final-success gains are small and a naive RAG variant attains the highest final success. Our findings suggest that these agentic frameworks, when properly designed, are most effective at compensating for the capacity limits of small and mid-sized models.</p></details> |  |

We present Cross-Trace Verification Protocol (CTVP), a novel AI control framework that verifies untrusted code-generating models through semantic orbit analysis. Rather than directly executing potentially malicious code, CTVP leverages the model's own predictions of execution traces across semantically equivalent program transformations. By analyzing consistency patterns in these predicted traces, we detect behavioral anomalies indicative of backdoors. Our approach introduces the Adversarial Robustness Quotient (ARQ), which quantifies the computational cost of verification relative to baseline generation, demonstrating exponential growth with orbit size. Theoretical analysis establishes information-theoretic bounds showing non-gamifiability -- adversaries cannot improve through training due to fundamental space complexity constraints. This work demonstrates that semantic orbit analysis provides a scalable, theoretically grounded approach to AI control for code generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 Pa...</summary><p>13 Pages, Initial Work on AI Control.

| **[Beyond Language Boundaries: Uncovering Programming Language Families for Code Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19509v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid proliferation of diverse programming languages presents both opportunities and challenges for developing multilingual code LLMs. While existing techniques often train code LLMs by simply aggregating multilingual code data, few explore the deeper relationships between programming languages(PLs) and how such relationships can be utilized to optimize the training and inference of code LLMs. In this work, we investigate 2 fundamental questions: 1) What are the deep linguistic relationships among PLs? and 2) How can these relationships be leveraged to improve multilingual code LLMs? We propose an embedding-based framework to uncover the latent families of PLs. Our approach begins by defining 21 primary linguistic features of programming languages, such as variable definition, control structures, and method declarations, and then employs LLMs to generate feature-aligned code samples across multiple languages. By embedding these semantically parallel code snippets from 19 languages, we construct a similarity matrix and perform hierarchical clustering to uncover inherent language relationships. Our analysis reveals clear hierarchical structures among programming languages. Closely related languages form well-defined clusters (e.g., C, C++, Java, and Swift group together), while Go exhibits as a central language with the highest cross-language similarity. Building on the uncovered language families, we propose three strategies to enhance multilingual LLM training: transfer learning across linguistically related languages, linguistic proximity-guided curriculum learning, and centroid-based intermediary code translation. Experiments on 4 code intelligence tasks demonstrate that our methods significantly improve multilingual LLM performance. This work offers a universal perspective on programming languages and advances more effective strategies for multilingual code LLM training.</p></details> | Accepted by FSE 2026 |

The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation. The inclusion of the ETM ensures that parameter updates of the learning module are executed only when the state deviation surpasses a predefined bound, thereby preventing excessive learning activity and substantially reducing computational load. A Lyapunov-oriented analysis is used to characterize the stability properties of the resulting closed-loop system. Numerical experiments further confirm that the developed approach maintains strong control performance and disturbance tolerance, while achieving a significant reduction in sampling and processing effort compared with standard time-triggered ADP schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>we ha...</summary><p>we have identified some technical issues, including the mathematical derivation.

| **[Research Program: Theory of Learning in Dynamical Systems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.19410v1)** | 2025-12-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern learning systems increasingly interact with data that evolve over time and depend on hidden internal state. We ask a basic question: when is such a dynamical system learnable from observations alone? This paper proposes a research program for understanding learnability in dynamical systems through the lens of next-token prediction. We argue that learnability in dynamical systems should be studied as a finite-sample question, and be based on the properties of the underlying dynamics rather than the statistical properties of the resulting sequence. To this end, we give a formulation of learnability for stochastic processes induced by dynamical systems, focusing on guarantees that hold uniformly at every time step after a finite burn-in period. This leads to a notion of dynamic learnability which captures how the structure of a system, such as stability, mixing, observability, and spectral properties, governs the number of observations required before reliable prediction becomes possible. We illustrate the framework in the case of linear dynamical systems, showing that accurate prediction can be achieved after finite observation without system identification, by leveraging improper methods based on spectral filtering. We survey the relationship between learning in dynamical systems and classical PAC, online, and universal prediction theories, and suggest directions for studying nonlinear and controlled systems.</p></details> |  |

Modern Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems, built upon Encoder-Decoder neural network architectures and trained on massive amounts of data, have progressively reduced transcription errors on standard benchmark datasets. However, their performance in real-world production environments, particularly for non-English content like long-form Italian videos, remains largely unexplored. This paper presents a case study on developing a professional subtitling system for an Italian media company. To inform our system design, we evaluated four state-of-the-art ASR models (Whisper Large v2, AssemblyAI Universal, Parakeet TDT v3 0.6b, and WhisperX) on a 50-hour dataset of Italian television programs. The study highlights their strengths and limitations, benchmarking their performance against the work of professional human subtitlers. The findings indicate that, while current models cannot meet the media industry's accuracy needs for full autonomy, they can serve as highly effective tools for enhancing human productivity. We conclude that a human-in-the-loop (HITL) approach is crucial and present the production-grade, cloud-based infrastructure we designed to support this workflow.</p></details> |  |

We introduce DafnyMPI, a novel, scalable approach to formally verifying MPI software. DafnyMPI allows proving deadlock freedom, termination, and functional equivalence with simpler sequential implementations. In contrast to existing specialized frameworks, DafnyMPI avoids custom concurrency logics and instead relies on Dafny, a verification-ready programming language used for sequential programs, extending it with concurrent reasoning abilities. DafnyMPI is implemented as a library that enables safe MPI programming by requiring users to specify the communication topology upfront and to verify that calls to communication primitives such as MPI_ISEND and MPI_WAIT meet their preconditions. We formalize DafnyMPI using a core calculus and prove that the preconditions suffice to guarantee deadlock freedom. Functional equivalence is proved via rely-guarantee reasoning over message payloads and a system that guarantees safe use of read and write buffers. Termination and the absence of runtime errors are proved using standard Dafny techniques. To further demonstrate the applicability of DafnyMPI, we verify numerical solutions to three canonical partial differential equations. We believe DafnyMPI demonstrates how to make formal verification viable for a broader class of programs and provides proof engineers with additional tools for software verification of parallel and concurrent systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in Proceedings of the ACM on Programming Languages (POPL)</p></details> |

While general-purpose programming languages are well supported, generating code for domain-specific languages remains a challenging problem for LLMs. In this paper, we focus on the LLM-based generation of code for Answer Set Programming (ASP), a particularly effective approach for finding solutions to combinatorial search problems. The effectiveness of LLMs in ASP code generation is currently hindered by the limited number of examples seen during their initial pre-training phase. In this paper, we introduce a novel ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach for solver-guided instruction-tuning of LLMs to addressing the highly complex semantic parsing task inherent in ASP code generation. Our method only requires problem specifications in natural language and their solutions. Specifically, we sample ASP statements for program continuations from LLMs for unriddling logic puzzles. Leveraging the special property of declarative ASP programming that partial encodings increasingly narrow down the solution space, we categorize them into chosen and rejected instances based on solver feedback. We then apply supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs on the curated data and further improve robustness using a solver-guided search that includes best-of-N sampling. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in two distinct prompting settings on two datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, accepted at AAAI'26</p></details> |
| **[Input Reduction Enhanced LLM-based Program Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15251v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in Automated Program Repair (APR). Test inputs, being crucial for reasoning the root cause of failures, are always included in the prompt for LLM-based APR. Unfortunately, LLMs struggle to retain key information in long prompts. When the test inputs are extensive in the prompt, this may trigger the "lost-in-the-middle" issue, compromising repair performance. ReduceFix prompts an LLM to generate a reducer that minimizes failure-inducing test inputs without human effort, and then feeds the reduced failure-inducing inputs to guide patch generation. For targeted evaluation, we constructed LFTBench, the first long-input APR benchmark with 200 real bugs from 20 programming tasks, each paired with a failure-inducing input whose median size is 1 MB. On this benchmark, ReduceFix shrinks inputs by 89.1% on average and improves overall pass@10 by up to 53.8% relative to a prompt that includes the original test, and by 17.6% compared with omitting the test entirely. Adding the same reduction step to ChatRepair and CREF increases their fix rate by 21.3% and 2.6%, respectively, without other changes. Our gains hold against a ddmin-only reducing template baseline and transfer to repository-level OSS-Fuzz cases. Ablation studies further highlight the impact of input length and compressed failure information on repair success. These results underscore that automatically reducing failing inputs is a practical and powerful complement to LLM-based APR, significantly improving its scalability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

While these platforms engage students through visual and gamified interfaces, teachers often face challenges in using them effectively and finding all the necessary features for classroom management. To address these challenges, we introduce SnapClass, a classroom management system integrated within the Snap! programming environment. SnapClass was iteratively developed drawing on established research about the pedagogical and logistical challenges teachers encounter in computing classrooms. Specifically, SnapClass allows educators to create and customize block-based coding assignments based on student skill levels, implement rubric-based auto-grading, and access student code history and recovery features. It also supports monitoring student engagement and idle time, and includes a help dashboard with a raise hand feature to assist students in real time. This paper describes the design and key features of SnapClass those are developed and those are under progress.</p></details> | 2 pages, 7 figures |

Such methods discard useful variants, suffer from destructive edits, and explore a brittle search space prone to structural failure. We introduce EvoLattice, a framework that represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph. Each node stores multiple persistent alternatives, and every valid path through the graph defines a distinct executable candidate, yielding a large combinatorial search space without duplicating structure. EvoLattice enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths in which it appears, producing statistics that reveal how local design choices affect global performance. These statistics provide a dense, data-driven feedback signal for LLM-guided mutation, recombination, and pruning, while preserving successful components. Structural correctness is guaranteed by a deterministic self-repair mechanism that enforces acyclicity and dependency consistency independently of the LLM. EvoLattice naturally extends to agent evolution by interpreting alternatives as prompt fragments or sub-agent behaviors. Across program synthesis (proxy and optimizer meta-learning), EvoLattice yields more stable evolution, greater expressivity, and stronger improvement trajectories than prior LLM-guided methods. The resulting dynamics resemble quality-diversity optimization, emerging implicitly from EvoLattice's internal multi-alternative representation rather than an explicit external archive.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharing State Between Prompts and Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14805v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced a new type of programming: natural language programming. By writing prompts that direct LLMs to perform natural language processing, code generation, reasoning, etc., users are writing code in natural language -- natural language code -- for the LLM to execute. An emerging area of research enables interoperability between natural language code and formal languages such as Python. We present a novel programming abstraction, shared program state, that removes the manual work required to enable interoperability between natural language code and program state. With shared program state, programmers can write natural code that directly writes program variables, computes with program objects, and implements control flow in the program. We present a schema for specifying natural function interfaces that extend programming systems to support natural code and leverage this schema to specify shared program state as a natural function interface. We implement shared program state in the Nightjar programming system. Nightjar enables programmers to write Python programs that contain natural code that shares the Python program state. We show that Nightjar programs achieve comparable or higher task accuracy than manually written implementations (+4-19%), while decreasing the lines of code by 39.6% on average. The tradeoff to using Nightjar is that it may incur runtime overhead (0.4-4.3x runtime of manual implementations).</p></details> |  |
| **[A Recursive Theory of Variational State Estimation: The Dynamic Programming Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11497v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, variational state estimation is examined from the dynamic programming perspective. This leads to two different value functional recursions depending on whether backward or forward dynamic programming is employed. The result is a theory of variational state estimation that corresponds to the classical theory of Bayesian state estimation. More specifically, in the backward method, the value functional corresponds to a likelihood that is upper bounded by the state likelihood from the Bayesian backward recursion. In the forward method, the value functional corresponds to an unnormalized density that is upper bounded by the unnormalized filtering density. Both methods can be combined to arrive at a variational two-filter formula. Additionally, it is noted that optimal variational filtering is generally of quadratic time-complexity in the sequence length. This motivates the notion of sub-optimal variational filtering, which also lower bounds the evidence but is of linear time-complexity. Another problem is the fact that the value functional recursions are generally intractable. This is briefly discussed and a simple approximation is suggested that retrieves the filter proposed by Courts et. al (2021).The methodology is examined in (i) a jump Gauss-Markov system under a certain factored Markov process approximation, and (ii) in a Gauss-Markov model with log-polynomial likelihoods under a Gauss--Markov constraint on the variational approximation. It is demonstrated that the value functional recursions are tractable in both cases. The resulting estimators are examined in simulation studies and are found to be of adequate quality in comparison to sensible baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Visual Programming for Visual Reasoning via Probabilistic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14257v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Visual Programming (VP) based on large language models (LLMs) has rapidly developed and demonstrated significant potential in complex Visual Reasoning (VR) tasks. Previous works to enhance VP have primarily focused on improving the quality of LLM-generated visual programs. However, they have neglected to optimize the VP-invoked pre-trained models, which serve as modules for the visual sub-tasks decomposed from the targeted tasks by VP. The difficulty is that there are only final labels of targeted VR tasks rather than labels of sub-tasks. Besides, the non-differentiable nature of VP impedes the direct use of efficient gradient-based optimization methods to leverage final labels for end-to-end learning of the entire VP framework. To overcome these issues, we propose EVPG, a method to Enhance Visual Programming for visual reasoning via Probabilistic Graphs. Specifically, we creatively build a directed probabilistic graph according to the variable dependency relationships during the VP executing process, which reconstructs the non-differentiable VP executing process into a differentiable exact probability inference process on this directed probabilistic graph. As a result, this enables the VP framework to utilize the final labels for efficient, gradient-based optimization in end-to-end supervised learning on targeted VR tasks. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our EVPG, showing significant performance improvements for VP on three classical complex VR tasks: GQA, NLVRv2, and Open Images.</p></details> | 13 Pages, 12 figures |
| **[Efficient Local and Tabu Search Strategies for Large-Scale Quadratic Integer Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14176v3)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the area of general quadratic integer programming (QIP), encompassing both unconstrained (UQIP) and constrained (CQIP) variants. These NP-hard problems have far-reaching applications, yet the non-convex cases have received limited attention in the literature. To address this gap, we introduce a closed-form formula for single-variable changes, establishing novel necessary and sufficient conditions for 1-Opt local improvement in UQIP and CQIP. We develop a simple local and sophisticated tabu search with an oscillation strategy tailored for large-scale problems. Experimental results on instances with up to 8000 variables demonstrate the efficiency of these strategies, producing high-quality solutions within a short time. Our approaches significantly outperform the Gurobi 11.0.2 solver.</p></details> | 32 pages, 8 figures |

Applications of TTE to emulate cluster randomized trials (RCTs) have been limited. This study explored how to integrate simulation-guided design into the TTE framework to inform planning of a non-randomized cluster trial. Methods: We performed simulations to prospectively plan data collection of a non-randomized study emulating a village-level cluster RCT when cluster-randomization was infeasible. The planned study will assess the impact of mass distribution of nutritional supplements embedded within an existing immunization program to improve pentavalent vaccination rates among children 12-24 months old in Niger. The design included covariate-constrained random selection of villages for outcome ascertainment at follow-up. Simulations used baseline census data on pentavalent vaccination rates and cluster-level covariates to compare the type I error rate and power of four statistical methods: beta-regression; quasi-binomial regression; inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW); and naive Wald test. Results: Of the four analytic methods considered, only IPTW and beta-regression controlled the type I error rate at 0.05, but IPTW yielded poor statistical power. Beta-regression that showed adequate statistical power was chosen as our primary analysis. Conclusions: Adopting simulation-guided design principles within TTE can enable robust planning of a group-level non-randomized study emulating a cluster RCT. Lessons from this study also apply to TTE planning of individually-RCTs.</p></details> |  |

Recent studies demonstrate an average 39% performance drop when instructions are delivered across multiple turns, with models making premature assumptions and failing to course correct (Laban et al., 2025). This degradation is particularly problematic in exploratory programming tasks where developers need to investigate alternative approaches without committing to a single path. Current solutions force users into a false dichotomy: continue in a context-polluted conversation where the LLM becomes increasingly confused, or start fresh and lose all accumulated context. We present ContextBranch, a conversation management system that applies version control semantics to LLM interactions. ContextBranch provides four core primitives--checkpoint, branch, switch, and inject--enabling users to capture conversation state, explore alternatives in isolation, and selectively merge insights. We evaluate ContextBranch through a controlled experiment with 30 software engineering scenarios featuring intentionally polluting explorations. Branched conversations achieved higher response quality compared to linear conversations, with large improvements in focus and context awareness. Benefits were concentrated in complex scenarios involving conceptually distant explorations. Branching reduced context size by 58.1% (31.0 to 13.0 messages), eliminating irrelevant exploratory content. Our work establishes conversation branching as a fundamental primitive for AI-assisted exploratory work, demonstrating that isolation prevents context pollution when exploring alternatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, 1 code snippet, 4 algorithms</p></details> |
| **[OPTIMA: Optimal One-shot Pruning for LLMs via Quadratic Programming Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13886v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training model pruning is a promising solution, yet it faces a trade-off: simple heuristics that zero weights are fast but degrade accuracy, while principled joint optimization methods recover accuracy but are computationally infeasible at modern scale. One-shot methods such as SparseGPT offer a practical trade-off in optimality by applying efficient, approximate heuristic weight updates. To close this gap, we introduce OPTIMA, a practical one-shot post-training pruning method that balances accuracy and scalability. OPTIMA casts layer-wise weight reconstruction after mask selection as independent, row-wise Quadratic Programs (QPs) that share a common layer Hessian. Solving these QPs yields the per-row globally optimal update with respect to the reconstruction objective given the estimated Hessian. The shared-Hessian structure makes the problem highly amenable to batching on accelerators. We implement an accelerator-friendly QP solver that accumulates one Hessian per layer and solves many small QPs in parallel, enabling one-shot post-training pruning at scale on a single accelerator without fine-tuning. OPTIMA integrates with existing mask selectors and consistently improves zero-shot performance across multiple LLM families and sparsity regimes, yielding up to 3.97% absolute accuracy improvement. On an NVIDIA H100, OPTIMA prunes a 8B-parameter transformer end-to-end in 40 hours with 60GB peak memory. Together, these results set a new state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-offs for one-shot post-training pruning.</p></details> |  |
| **[FLARE v2: A Recursive Framework for Program Comprehension Across Common Teaching Languages and Levels of Abstraction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09261v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Building on the classroom framework in Heath et al. (2025), this paper proposes FLARE v2 as a recursive, semiotically informed account of how program meaning can be described across abstraction scales in common teaching languages. It reframes FLARE v1's tiers as one cycle: identify bounded elements (Receives, Sends, Effects, Shares), analyse bindings along two dimensions (Causal-Temporal and Communicative), and treat the bound set as a new element at the next scale. Causal-Temporal binding has three subtypes - Sequential, Branch, and Event - to distinguish user-authored control flow from event-driven control whose dispatch is hidden in the runtime. A Compositional Ladder visualises the same compositional move from blocks and statements through segments and systems. FLARE v2 is scoped to imperative and event-driven environments typical of primary and lower-secondary curricula. Above the system layer, behaviour is increasingly shaped by interaction between code and operating context (scheduling, infrastructure, permissions, contracts, failures, platform policy). Here, the element-and-binding vocabulary remains a structural baseline, but continuity of explanation typically requires overlays that make environmental constraints explicit. Event binding and overlays serve a common pedagogical role - preserving coherent structural reasoning where key causal mechanisms are not fully visible in the authored artefact. OOP design reasoning, explicit concurrency models, distributed systems, and functional paradigms are treated as future extensions; implementation and evaluation are left for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Scaling Laws for Code: Every Programming Language Matters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13472v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code large language models (Code LLMs) are powerful but costly to train, with scaling laws predicting performance from model size, data, and compute. However, different programming languages (PLs) have varying impacts during pre-training that significantly affect base model performance, leading to inaccurate performance prediction. Besides, existing works focus on language-agnostic settings, neglecting the inherently multilingual nature of modern software development. Therefore, it is first necessary to investigate the scaling laws of different PLs, and then consider their mutual influences to arrive at the final multilingual scaling law. In this paper, we present the first systematic exploration of scaling laws for multilingual code pre-training, conducting over 1000+ experiments (Equivalent to 336,000+ H800 hours) across multiple PLs, model sizes (0.2B to 14B parameters), and dataset sizes (1T tokens). We establish comprehensive scaling laws for code LLMs across multiple PLs, revealing that interpreted languages (e.g., Python) benefit more from increased model size and data than compiled languages (e.g., Rust). The study demonstrates that multilingual pre-training provides synergistic benefits, particularly between syntactically similar PLs. Further, the pre-training strategy of the parallel pairing (concatenating code snippets with their translations) significantly enhances cross-lingual abilities with favorable scaling properties. Finally, a proportion-dependent multilingual scaling law is proposed to optimally allocate training tokens by prioritizing high-utility PLs (e.g., Python), balancing high-synergy pairs (e.g., JavaScript-TypeScript), and reducing allocation to fast-saturating languages (Rust), achieving superior average performance across all PLs compared to uniform distribution under the same compute budget.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Programming Meets Automata Theory: Exact Inference using Weighted Automata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13185v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic programs encode stochastic models as ordinary-looking programs with primitives for sampling numbers from predefined distributions and conditioning. Their applications include, among many others, machine learning and modeling of autonomous systems. The analysis of probabilistic programs is often quantitative - it involves reasoning about numerical properties like probabilities and expectations. A particularly important quantitative property of probabilistic programs is their posterior distribution, i.e., the distribution over possible outputs for a given input (or prior) distribution. Computing the posterior distribution exactly is known as exact inference. We present our current research using weighted automata, a generalization of the well-known finite automata, for performing exact inference in a restricted class of discrete probabilistic programs. This is achieved by encoding distributions over program variables - possibly with infinite support - as certain weighted automata. The semantics of our programming language then corresponds to common automata-theoretic constructions, such as product, concatenation, and others.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Optimize for Mixed-Integer Non-linear Programming with Feasibility Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11061v10)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs) arise in domains such as energy systems, process engineering, and transportation, and are notoriously difficult to solve at scale due to the interplay of discrete decisions and nonlinear constraints. In many practical settings, these problems appear in parametric form, where objectives and constraints depend on instance-specific parameters, creating the need for fast and reliable solutions across related instances. While learning-to-optimize (L2O) methods have shown strong performance in continuous optimization, extending them to MINLPs requires enforcing both feasibility and integrality within a data-driven framework. We propose an L2O approach tailored to parametric MINLPs that generates instance-specific solutions using integer correction layers to enforce integrality and a gradient-based projection to ensure feasibility of the inequality constraints. Theoretically, we provide asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence guarantees of the projection step. Empirically, the framework scales to MINLPs with tens of thousands of variables and produces feasible high-quality solutions within milliseconds, often outperforming traditional solvers and heuristic baselines in repeated-solve settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Satisfiability Modulo Theory Meets Inductive Logic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12918v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) provides interpretable rule learning in relational domains, yet remains limited in its ability to induce and reason with numerical constraints. Classical ILP systems operate over discrete predicates and typically rely on discretisation or hand-crafted numerical predicates, making it difficult to infer thresholds or arithmetic relations that must hold jointly across examples. Recent work has begun to address these limitations through tighter integrations of ILP with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) or specialised numerical inference mechanisms. In this paper we investigate a modular alternative that couples the ILP system PyGol with the SMT solver Z3. Candidate clauses proposed by PyGol are interpreted as quantifier-free formulas over background theories such as linear or nonlinear real arithmetic, allowing numerical parameters to be instantiated and verified by the SMT solver while preserving ILP's declarative relational bias. This supports the induction of hybrid rules that combine symbolic predicates with learned numerical constraints, including thresholds, intervals, and multi-literal arithmetic relations. We formalise this SMT-ILP setting and evaluate it on a suite of synthetic datasets designed to probe linear, relational, nonlinear, and multi-hop reasoning. The results illustrate how a modular SMT-ILP architecture can extend the expressivity of symbolic rule learning, complementing prior numerical ILP approaches while providing a flexible basis for future extensions toward richer theory-aware induction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interactive Program Synthesis for Modeling Collaborative Physical Activities from Narrated Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24250v2)** | 2025-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teaching systems physical tasks is a long standing goal in HCI, yet most prior work has focused on non collaborative physical activities. Collaborative tasks introduce added complexity, requiring systems to infer users assumptions about their teammates intent, which is an inherently ambiguous and dynamic process. This necessitates representations that are interpretable and correctable, enabling users to inspect and refine system behavior. We address this challenge by framing collaborative task learning as a program synthesis problem. Our system represents behavior as editable programs and uses narrated demonstrations, i.e. paired physical actions and natural language, as a unified modality for teaching, inspecting, and correcting system logic without requiring users to see or write code. The same modality is used for the system to communicate its learning to users. In a within subjects study, 20 users taught multiplayer soccer tactics to our system. 70 percent (14/20) of participants successfully refined learned programs to match their intent and 90 percent (18/20) found it easy to correct the programs. The study surfaced unique challenges in representing learning as programs and in enabling users to teach collaborative physical activities. We discuss these issues and outline mitigation strategies.</p></details> |  |

We view an optimizer as a short program over a small vocabulary of search operators and learn this operator program separately for each problem instance. We instantiate this idea in Operator-Programmed Algorithms (OPAL), a landscape-aware framework for continuous black-box optimization that uses a small design budget with a standard differential evolution baseline to probe the landscape, builds a $k$-nearest neighbor graph over sampled points, and encodes this trajectory with a graph neural network. A meta-learner then maps the resulting representation to a phase-wise schedule of exploration, restart, and local search operators. On the CEC~2017 test suite, a single meta-trained OPAL policy is statistically competitive with state-of-the-art adaptive differential evolution variants and achieves significant improvements over simpler baselines under nonparametric tests. Ablation studies on CEC~2017 justify the choices for the design phase, the trajectory graph, and the operator-program representation, while the meta-components add only modest wall-clock overhead. Overall, the results indicate that operator-programmed, landscape-aware per-instance design is a practical way forward beyond ad hoc metaphor-based algorithms in black-box optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code, experiment scripts, and results are publicly available at https://github.com/junbolian/OPAL.

Among vulnerable road users, bicyclists present unique characteristics that make their safety both critical and also manageable. Vehicles often travel at significantly higher relative speeds when interacting with bicyclists as compared to their interactions with pedestrians which makes collision avoidance system design for bicyclist safety more challenging. Yet, bicyclist movements are generally more predictable and governed by clear traffic rules as compared to the sudden and sometimes erratic pedestrian motion, offering opportunities for model-based control strategies. To address bicyclist safety in complex traffic environments, this study proposes and develops a High Order Control Lyapunov Function High Order Control Barrier Function Quadratic Programming (HOCLF HOCBF QP) control framework. Through this framework, CLFs constraints guarantee system stability so that the vehicle can track its reference trajectory, whereas CBFs constraints ensure system safety by letting vehicle avoiding potential collisions region with surrounding obstacles. Then by solving a QP problem, an optimal control command that simultaneously satisfies stability and safety requirements can be calculated. Three key bicyclist crash scenarios recorded in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) are recreated and used to comprehensively evaluate the proposed autonomous driving bicyclist safety control strategy in a simulation study. Simulation results demonstrate that the HOCLF HOCBF QP controller can help the vehicle perform robust, and collision-free maneuvers, highlighting its potential for improving bicyclist safety in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  |

While machine learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions, their effectiveness is limited by the way they interpret data. Unlike natural language, source code meaning is defined less by token adjacency and more by complex, long-range, and structural relationships and dependencies. This limitation is especially pronounced for C and C++, where flatter syntactic hierarchies, pointer aliasing, multi-level indirection, typedef-based type obfuscation, and function-pointer calls hinder accurate static analysis. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ATLAS, a Python-based Command-Line Interface (CLI) that (i) generates statement-level Control Flow Graphs (CFG) and type-aware Data Flow Graphs (DFG) that capture inter-functional dependencies for the entire program; (ii) has the ability to work on entire C and C++ projects comprising multiple files; (iii) works on both compilable and non-compilable code and (iv) produces a unified multi-view code representation using Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), CFG and DFG. By preserving essential structural and semantic information, ATLAS provides a practical foundation for improving downstream SE and machine-learning-based program understanding.

Educators such as speech-language pathologists (SLPs) address this instructional gap by using an inquiry-based approach to teach spelling that targets the phonology, morphology, meaning, and etymology of words. Yet, these strategies rarely appear in everyday writing tools, which simply detect and autocorrect errors. We introduce SPIRE (Spelling Inquiry Engine), a spell check system that brings this inquiry-based pedagogy into the act of composition. SPIRE implements Pedagogical Program Synthesis, a novel approach for operationalizing the inherently dynamic pedagogy of spelling instruction. SPIRE represents SLP instructional moves in a domain-specific language, synthesizes tailored programs in real-time from learner errors, and renders them as interactive interfaces for inquiry-based interventions. With SPIRE, spelling errors become opportunities to explore word meanings, word structures, morphological families, word origins, and grapheme-phoneme correspondences, supporting metalinguistic reasoning alongside correction. Evaluation with SLPs and learners shows alignment with professional practice and potential for integration into writing workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 Figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |

We introduce solvable tuple patterns (STPs) and conjunctive STPs (CSTPs), novel formalisms for expressing and inferring invariants between list-like recursive data structures. A distinguishing feature of STPs is that they can be efficiently inferred from only a small number of positive samples; no negative samples are required. After presenting properties and inference algorithms of STPs and CSTPs, we show how to incorporate the CSTP inference into a CHC (Constrained Horn Clauses) solver supporting list-like data structures, which serves as a uniform backend for automated program verification tools. A CHC solver incorporating the (C)STP inference has won the ADT-LIN category of CHC-COMP 2025 by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |

However, the relative impact of these methods during the learning and post-learning phases remains unclear. In this work, we present a large-scale study comparing the effectiveness of various intervention methods in elementary programming both during learning and on novel tasks post-learning. Specifically, we compare three intervention methods: code-edit recommendations (Code-Rec), quizzes based on code edits (Code-Quiz), and quizzes based on metacognitive strategies (Plan-Quiz), along with a no-intervention control (group None). A total of 398 students (across grades 4-7) participated in a two-phase study: learning phase comprising write-code tasks from the Hour of Code: Maze Challenge with the intervention, followed by a post-learning phase comprising more advanced write-code tasks without any intervention. All intervention methods significantly improved learning performance over the control group while preserving students' problem-solving skills in the post-learning phase. Quiz-based methods further improved performance on novel post-learning tasks. Students in intervention groups also reported greater engagement and perceived skill growth.</p></details> | Preprint |

However, building agents for these tasks faces a critical bottleneck: the reliance on ever-expanding interaction history incurs substantial context overhead. Existing context management and compression techniques often fail to preserve vital semantic information, leading to degraded task performance. We propose AgentProg, a program-guided approach for agent context management that reframes the interaction history as a program with variables and control flow. By organizing information according to the structure of program, this structure provides a principled mechanism to determine which information should be retained and which can be discarded. We further integrate a global belief state mechanism inspired by Belief MDP framework to handle partial observability and adapt to unexpected environmental changes. Experiments on AndroidWorld and our extended long-horizon task suite demonstrate that AgentProg has achieved the state-of-the-art success rates on these benchmarks. More importantly, it maintains robust performance on long-horizon tasks while baseline methods experience catastrophic degradation.

Prior LLM approaches either rely on brittle prompting or costly retraining with limited generalization. We present AlphaOPT, a self-improving experience library that enables an LLM to learn from limited demonstrations (even answers alone, without gold-standard programs) and solver feedback - without annotated reasoning traces or parameter updates. AlphaOPT operates in a continual two-phase cycle: (i) a Library Learning phase that reflects on failed attempts, extracting solver-verified, structured insights as {taxonomy, condition, explanation, example}; and (ii) a Library Evolution phase that diagnoses retrieval misalignments and refines the applicability conditions of stored insights, improving transfer across tasks. This design (1) learns efficiently from limited demonstrations without curated rationales, (2) expands continually without costly retraining by updating the library rather than model weights, and (3) makes knowledge explicit and interpretable for human inspection and intervention. Experiments show that AlphaOPT steadily improves with more data (65% to 72% from 100 to 300 training items) and surpasses the strongest baseline by 7.7% on the out-of-distribution OptiBench dataset when trained only on answers. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/Minw913/AlphaOPT.</p></details> |  |

Yet, the BBV's fundamental limitations: order-dependent IDs that prevent cross-program knowledge reuse and a lack of semantic content predictive of hardware performance have left a massive potential for optimization untapped. To address these gaps, we introduce SemanticBBV, a novel, two-stage framework that generates robust, performance-aware signatures for cross-program simulation reuse. First, a lightweight RWKV-based semantic encoder transforms assembly basic blocks into rich Basic Block Embeddings (BBEs), capturing deep functional semantics. Second, an order-invariant Set Transformer aggregates these BBEs, weighted by execution frequency, into a final signature. Crucially, this stage is co-trained with a dual objective: a triplet loss for signature distinctiveness and a Cycles Per Instruction (CPI) regression task, directly imbuing the signature with performance sensitivity. Our evaluation demonstrates that SemanticBBV not only matches traditional BBVs in single-program accuracy but also enables unprecedented cross-program analysis. By simulating just 14 universal program points, we estimated the performance of ten SPEC CPU benchmarks with 86.3% average accuracy, achieving a 7143x simulation speedup. Furthermore, the signature shows strong adaptability to new microarchitectures with minimal fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ASP-DAC 2026 conference</p></details> |

Predict-and-Search methods operate by using a predictive model to estimate promising variable assignments and then guiding a search procedure toward high-quality solutions. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating machine learning (ML) into the Predict-and-Search framework significantly enhances its performance. Still, it is restricted to binary problems and overlooks the presence of fixed variables that commonly arise in practical settings. This work extends the Predict-and-Search (PaS) framework to parametric MIPs and introduces ID-PaS, an identity-aware learning framework that enables the ML model to handle heterogeneous variables more effectively. Experiments on several real-world large-scale problems demonstrate that ID-PaS consistently achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art solver Gurobi and PaS.</p></details> |  |

Modeling a DP as deterministic time evolution over a topologically ordered DAG with frontier width $ω$ and bounded in-degree, and assuming a max-type semiring with deterministic tie breaking, we prove that in a standard offline random-access model any such DP admits deterministic traceback in space $O(ω\log T + (\log T)^{O(1)})$ cells over a fixed finite alphabet, where $T$ is the number of states. Our construction replaces backward dynamic programs by forward-only recomputation and organizes the time order into a height-compressed recursion tree whose nodes expose small "middle frontiers'' across which every optimal path must pass. The framework yields near-optimal traceback bounds for asymmetric and banded sequence alignment, one-dimensional recurrences, and dynamic-programming formulations on graphs of bounded pathwidth. We also show that an $Ω(ω)$ space term (in bits) is unavoidable in forward single-pass models and discuss conjectured $\sqrt{T}$-type barriers in streaming settings, supporting the view that space-efficient traceback is a structural property of width-bounded DP DAGs rather than a peculiarity of grid-based algorithms.</p></details> | 31 pages |
| **[Human Attention During Localization of Memory Bugs in C Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00693v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a study of human visual attention during localization of memory bugs in C. Human visual attention refers to the mechanical processes by which we selectively process and prioritize information. Visual attention is important to study because it is central to what information people (who are sighted) use to solve a particular problem. Meanwhile, memory bugs are among the most common types of bugs in C programs that manifest as a variety of program faults. In this paper, we study human visual attention while people attempt to locate memory bugs in code. We recruit 21 programmers to locate between one and eight memory bugs in three C programs for 1.5-2 hours each. In total we collected observations of 31 hours of programmer effort. The bugs in our study cover memory leaks, overflows, and double frees, which are among the most common memory bugs. We analyze the task outcomes in terms of success rate and related factors, patterns of visual attention overall such as what lines and functions are read, and finally we explore differences of visual attention patterns during success versus failure cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rule-Based Graph Programs Matching the Time Complexity of Imperative Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09144v3)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report on recent advances in rule-based graph programming, which allow us to match the time complexity of some fundamental imperative graph algorithms. In general, achieving the time complexity of graph algorithms implemented in conventional languages using a rule-based graph-transformation language is challenging due to the cost of graph matching. Previous work demonstrated that with rooted rules, certain algorithms can be implemented in the graph programming language GP 2 such that their runtime matches the time complexity of imperative implementations. However, this required input graphs to have a bounded node degree and (for some algorithms) to be connected. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by enhancing the graph data structure generated by the GP 2 compiler and exploiting the new structure in programs. We present three case studies: the first program checks whether input graphs are connected, the second program checks whether input graphs are acyclic, and the third program solves the single-source shortest-paths problem for graphs with integer edge-weights. The first two programs run in linear time on (possibly disconnected) input graphs with arbitrary node degrees. The third program runs in time $O(nm)$ on arbitrary input graphs, matching the time complexity of imperative implementations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. For each program, we formally prove its correctness and time complexity, and provide runtime experiments on various graph classes.</p></details> | LMCS |
| **[Simple Modal Types for Functional Reactive Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09412v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional reactive programming (FRP) is a declarative programming paradigm for implementing reactive programs at a high level of abstraction. It applies functional programming principles to construct and manipulate time-varying values, also known as signals. However, for this programming paradigm to work in practice, an FRP language must ensure that programs are causal, productive, and free from space leaks. Over the past fifteen years, several modal type systems to enforce these operational properties have been developed. We present a new FRP language with a significantly simplified modal type system that imposes fewer restrictions than previous modal FRP languages while still guaranteeing the central operational properties of causality, productivity, and absence of space leaks. The key enabling idea is to alter the semantics of signals so that the type system can safely allow more programs to type-check, which also makes the language more expressive. With this new semantics, signals are modelled as mutable references whose mutability is tightly controlled by the 'later' type modality. This disciplined form of mutability also enables more efficient in-place updates of signals, all while preserving a functional programming style.</p></details> |  |

We use MAGPIE (Machine Automated General Performance Improvement via Evolution of software) to speedup a C++ linear genetic programming interpreter. Local search is provided with three alternative hand optimised codes, revision history and the Intel 512 bit AVX512VL documentation as C++ XML. Magpie is applied to the new Single Instruction Multiple Data (SIMD) parallel interpreter for Peter Nordin's linear genetic programming GPengine.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for RTL automation, their performance and research focus have overwhelmingly centered on RTL generation rather than verification. Current methods for RTL verification rely on large scale proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) to generate Python-based functional references, incurring a high cost and raising data-privacy risks. To date, an end-to-end open-source solution for autonomous verification remains absent. We introduce PRO-V-R1, the first trainable open-source agentic framework for autonomous RTL verification. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we design PRO-V sys, a modular agentic system that couples LLM-based reasoning with programmatic tool use for RTL verification; (2) we establish a data construction pipeline that leverages existing RTL datasets to build simulation-validated, expert-level trajectories tailored for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) RTL verification agents; and (3) we implement an efficient reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that uses verification-specific rewards derived from program-tool feedback to optimize the end-to-end verification workflow. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates PRO-V-R1 achieves a 57.7% functional correctness rate and 34.0% in robust fault detection, significantly outperforming the base model's 25.7% and 21.8% (respectively) from the state-of-the-art (SOTA) automatic verification system. This configuration also outperforms large-scale proprietary LLMs in functional correctness and shows comparable robustness for fault detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[PIP: Making Andersen's Points-to Analysis Sound and Practical for Incomplete C Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07299v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Compiling files individually lends itself well to parallelization, but forces the compiler to operate on incomplete programs. State-of-the-art points-to analyses guarantee sound solutions only for complete programs, requiring summary functions to describe any missing program parts. Summary functions are rarely available in production compilers, however, where soundness and efficiency are non-negotiable. This paper presents an Andersen-style points-to analysis that efficiently produces sound solutions for incomplete C programs. The analysis accomplishes soundness by tracking memory locations and pointers that are accessible from external modules, and efficiency by performing this tracking implicitly in the constraint graph. We show that implicit pointee tracking makes the constraint solver 15$\times$ faster than any combination of five different state-of-the-art techniques using explicit pointee tracking. We also present the Prefer Implicit Pointees (PIP) technique that further reduces the use of explicit pointees. PIP gives an additional speedup of 1.9$\times$, compared to the fastest solver configuration not benefiting from PIP. The precision of the analysis is evaluated in terms of an alias-analysis client, where it reduces the number of MayAlias-responses by 40% compared to LLVM's BasicAA pass alone. Finally, we show that the analysis is scalable in terms of memory, making it suitable for optimizing compilers in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures.

| **[A Data Envelopment Analysis Approach for Assessing Fairness in Resource Allocation: Application to Kidney Exchange Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.02799v2)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Kidney exchange programs have substantially increased transplantation rates but also raise critical concerns about fairness in organ allocation. We propose a novel framework leveraging Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to evaluate multiple dimensions of fairness-Priority, Access, and Outcome-within a unified model. This approach captures complexities often missed in single-metric analyses. Using data from the United Network for Organ Sharing, we separately quantify fairness across these dimensions: Priority fairness through waitlist durations, Access fairness via the Living Kidney Donor Profile Index (LKDPI) scores, and Outcome fairness based on graft lifespan. We then apply our conditional DEA model with covariate adjustment to demonstrate significant disparities in kidney allocation efficiency across ethnic groups. To quantify uncertainty, we employ conformal prediction within a novel Reference Frontier Mapping (RFM) framework, yielding group-conditional prediction intervals with finite-sample coverage guarantees. Our findings show notable differences in efficiency distributions between ethnic groups. Our study provides a rigorous framework for evaluating fairness in complex resource allocation systems with resource scarcity and mutual compatibility constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[A biconvex optimization for solving semidefinite programs via bilinear factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01198v13)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many problems in machine learning can be reduced to learning a low-rank positive semidefinite matrix (denoted as $Z$), which encounters semidefinite program (SDP). Existing SDP solvers by classical convex optimization are expensive to solve large-scale problems. Employing the low rank of solution, Burer-Monteiro's method reformulated SDP as a nonconvex problem via the {\emph{quadratic}} factorization ($Z$ as $XX^\top$). However, this would lose the structure of problem in optimization. In this paper, we propose to convert SDP into a biconvex problem via the {\emph{bilinear}} factorization ($Z$ as $XY^\top$), and while adding the term $\frac{\g}{2}\normfs{X-Y}$ to penalize the difference of $X$ and $Y$. Thus, the biconvex structure (w.r.t. $X$ and $Y$) can be exploited naturally in optimization. As a theoretical result, we provide a bound to the penalty parameter $\g$ under the assumption of $L$-Lipschitz smoothness and $σ$-strongly biconvexity, such that, at stationary points, the proposed bilinear factorization is equivalent to Burer-Monteiro's factorization when the bound is arrived, that is $\g>\frac{1}{4}(L-σ)_+$. Our proposal opens up a new way to surrogate SDP by biconvex program. Experiments on two SDP-related applications demonstrate that the proposed method is effective as the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

Existing learning-based methods like Neural Two-Stage Stochastic Programming (Neur2SP) employ neural networks (NNs) as recourse function surrogates but rely on computationally intensive mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations. We propose ICNN-enhanced 2SP, a method that leverages Input Convex Neural Networks (ICNNs) to exploit linear programming (LP) representability in convex 2SP problems. By architecturally enforcing convexity and enabling exact inference through LP, our approach eliminates the need for integer variables inherent to the conventional MIP-based formulation while retaining an exact embedding of the ICNN surrogate within the 2SP framework. This results in a more computationally efficient alternative, and we show that good solution quality can be maintained. Comprehensive experiments reveal that ICNNs incur only marginally longer training times while achieving validation accuracy on par with their standard NN counterparts. Across benchmark problems, ICNN-enhanced 2SP often exhibits considerably faster solution times than the MIP-based formulations while preserving solution quality, with these advantages becoming significantly more pronounced as problem scale increases. For the most challenging instances, the method achieves speedups of up to 100$\times$ and solution quality superior to MIP-based formulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Dynamic Programming Theory for Leader-Follower Stochastic Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05667v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leader-follower general-sum stochastic games (LF-GSSGs) model sequential decision-making under asymmetric commitment, where a leader commits to a policy and a follower best responds, yielding a strong Stackelberg equilibrium (SSE) with leader-favourable tie-breaking. This paper introduces a dynamic programming (DP) framework that applies Bellman recursion over credible sets-state abstractions formally representing all rational follower best responses under partial leader commitments-to compute SSEs. We first prove that any LF-GSSG admits a lossless reduction to a Markov decision process (MDP) over credible sets. We further establish that synthesising an optimal memoryless deterministic leader policy is NP-hard, motivating the development of ε-optimal DP algorithms with provable guarantees on leader exploitability. Experiments on standard mixed-motive benchmarks-including security games, resource allocation, and adversarial planning-demonstrate empirical gains in leader value and runtime scalability over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 31 pages, 5 figures |

Currently, low-code/no-code platforms are widely used to enable end-user development through visual programming, minimizing the need for manual coding. Recent advancements in generative AI, particularly large language model-based assistants and "copilots", open new possibilities, as they may enable end users to generate and refine programming code and build apps directly from natural language prompts. This approach, here referred to as AI-assisted end-user coding, promises greater flexibility, broader applicability, faster development, improved reusability, and reduced vendor lock-in compared to the established visual LCNC platforms. This paper investigates whether AI-assisted end-user coding is a feasible paradigm for end-user development, which may complement or even replace the LCNC model in the future. To explore this, we conducted a case study in which non-programmers were asked to develop a basic web app through interaction with AI assistants.The majority of study participants successfully completed the task in reasonable time and also expressed support for AI-assisted end-user coding as a viable approach for end-user development. The paper presents the study design, analyzes the outcomes, and discusses potential implications for practice, future research, and academic teaching.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

Many LCP tools have rapidly evolved and have benefited from the concepts of visual programming languages (VPLs) and programming by demonstration (PBD). With the huge increase in interest in using large language models (LLMs) in software engineering, LLM-based LCP has begun to become increasingly important. However, the technical principles and application scenarios of traditional approaches to LCP and LLM-based LCP are significantly different. Understanding these key differences and characteristics in the application of the two approaches to LCP by users is crucial for LCP providers in improving existing and developing new LCP tools and in better assisting users in choosing the appropriate LCP technology. We conducted an empirical study of both traditional LCP and LLM-based LCP. We analyzed developers' discussions on Stack Overflow (SO) over the past three years and then explored the similarities and differences between traditional LCP and LLM-based LCP features and developer feedback. Our findings reveal that while traditional LCP and LLM-based LCP share common primary usage scenarios, they significantly differ in scope, limitations, and usage throughout the software development lifecycle, particularly during the implementation phase. We also examine how LLMs impact and integrate with LCP, discussing the latest technological developments in LLM-based LCP, such as its integration with VPLs and the application of LLM Agents in software engineering.</p></details> |  |

However, a significant performance disparity persists between popular programming languages (e.g., Python, C++) and others. To address this capability gap, we leverage the code translation task to train LLMs, thereby facilitating the transfer of coding proficiency across diverse programming languages. Moreover, we introduce OORL for training, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates on-policy and off-policy strategies. Within OORL, on-policy RL is applied during code translation, guided by a rule-based reward signal derived from unit tests. Complementing this coarse-grained rule-based reward, we propose Group Equivalent Preference Optimization (GEPO), a novel preference optimization method. Specifically, GEPO trains the LLM using intermediate representations (IRs) groups. LLMs can be guided to discern IRs equivalent to the source code from inequivalent ones, while also utilizing signals about the mutual equivalence between IRs within the group. This process allows LLMs to capture nuanced aspects of code functionality. By employing OORL for training with code translation tasks, LLMs improve their recognition of code functionality and their understanding of the relationships between code implemented in different languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our OORL for LLMs training with code translation tasks achieves significant performance improvements on code benchmarks across multiple programming languages.</p></details> |  |

However, little is known about how to effectively leverage these hints while ensuring autonomous and meaningful learning. One promising approach involves pairing AI-generated hints with reflection prompts, asking students to review and analyze their learning, when they request hints. This study investigates the interplay between AI-generated hints and different designs of reflection prompts in an online introductory programming course. We conducted a two-trial field experiment. In Trial 1, students were randomly assigned to receive prompts either before or after receiving hints, or no prompt at all. Each prompt also targeted one of three SRL phases: planning, monitoring, and evaluation. In Trial 2, we examined two types of prompt guidance: directed (offering more explicit and structured guidance) and open (offering more general and less constrained guidance). Findings show that students in the before-hint (RQ1), planning (RQ2), and directed (RQ3) prompt groups produced higher-quality reflections but reported lower satisfaction with AI-generated hints than those in other conditions. Immediate performance did not differ across conditions. This negative relationship between reflection quality and hint satisfaction aligns with previous work on student mental effort and satisfaction. Our results highlight the need to reconsider how AI models are trained and evaluated for education, as prioritizing user satisfaction can undermine deeper learning.</p></details> | Preprint |

Unlike binary matrix factorization based on standard arithmetic, BMF employs the Boolean OR and AND operations for the matrix product, which improves interpretability and reduces the approximation error. It is also used in role mining and computer vision. In this paper, we first propose algorithms for BMF that perform alternating optimization (AO) of the factor matrices, where each subproblem is solved via integer programming (IP). We then design different approaches to further enhance AO-based algorithms by selecting an optimal subset of rank-one factors from multiple runs. To address the scalability limits of IP-based methods, we introduce new greedy and local-search heuristics. We also construct a new C++ data structure for Boolean vectors and matrices that is significantly faster than existing ones and is of independent interest, allowing our heuristics to scale to large datasets. We illustrate the performance of all our proposed methods and compare them with the state of the art on various real datasets, both with and without missing data, including applications in topic modeling and imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 12 tables, 3 figures, 2 typos corrected in v2, code and data available from https://gitlab.com/ckolomvakis/boolean-matrix-factorization-ip-and-heuristics</p></details> |

We present a unified taxonomy that groups 62 recent LLM-based repair systems into four paradigms defined by parameter adaptation and control authority over the repair loop, and overlays two cross-cutting layers for retrieval and analysis augmentation. Prior surveys have either focused on classical software repair techniques, on LLMs in software engineering more broadly, or on subsets of LLM-based software repair, such as fine-tuning strategies or vulnerability repair. We complement these works by treating fine-tuning, prompting, procedural pipelines, and agentic frameworks as first-class paradigms and systematically mapping representative systems to each of these paradigms. We also consolidate evaluation practice on common benchmarks by recording benchmark scope, pass@k, and fault-localization assumptions to support a more meaningful comparison of reported success rates. We clarify trade-offs among paradigms in task alignment, deployment cost, controllability, and ability to repair multi-hunk or cross-file bugs. We discuss challenges in current LLM-based software repair and outline research directions. Our artifacts, including the representation papers and scripted survey pipeline, are publicly available at https://github.com/GLEAM-Lab/ProgramRepair.</p></details> |  |
| **[New Perspectives on Semiring Applications to Dynamic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03916v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semiring algebras have been shown to provide a suitable language to formalize many noteworthy combinatorial problems. For instance, the Shortest-Path problem can be seen as a special case of the Algebraic-Path problem when applied to the tropical semiring. The application of semirings typically makes it possible to solve extended problems without increasing the computational complexity. In this article we further exploit the idea of using semiring algebras to address and tackle several extensions of classical computational problems by dynamic programming. We consider a general approach which allows us to define a semiring extension of any problem with a reasonable notion of a certificate (e.g., an NP problem). This allows us to consider cost variants of these combinatorial problems, as well as their counting extensions where the goal is to determine how many solutions a given problem admits. The approach makes no particular assumptions (such as idempotence) on the semiring structure. We also propose a new associative algebraic operation on semirings, called $Δ$-product, which enables our dynamic programming algorithms to count the number of solutions of minimal costs. We illustrate the advantages of our framework on two well-known but computationally very different NP-hard problems, namely, Connected-Dominating-Set problems and finite-domain Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). In particular, we prove fixed parameter tractability (FPT) with respect to clique-width and tree-width of the input. This also allows us to count solutions of minimal cost, which is an overlooked problem in the literature.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches to agent programming often entangle two aspects of agent design: the core workflow logic and the inference-time strategy (e.g., tree search). We introduce "probabilistic angelic nondeterminism" ("PAN"), a programming model that disentangles these two concerns, allowing the programmer to describe the agent workflow and independently experiment with different inference-time strategies by simply changing a few inputs. We provide an implementation of PAN in Python as the EnCompass framework, which uses a Python decorator to compile agent workflow programs into a search space. We present three case studies that demonstrate how the framework lets the programmer quickly improve the reliability of an agent and easily switch between different inference-time strategies, all with little additional coding.</p></details> | <details><summary>65 pa...</summary><p>65 pages, 2 figures, published in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

In recent decades, pure functional languages such as Haskell have been shown to be highly effective in producing robust software due to immutable data structures, among other functional features. The advantages of programming with immutable data structures can also be had in non-functional languages such as Python. Over the years, non-functional languages have introduced immutable data structures as well as comprehension and lambda expressions, and it is possible to program in a purely functional style in them. In this paper, we present a ``best practice'' idea in introductory programming classes that forces students to learn and complete programming assignments in a purely functional subset of Python. By doing so, the student can learn functional ideas such as immutability, pure functions with no side effects, and stateless programming. We define a functional subset of Python and illustrate the best practice using small examples. We strongly feel that students in computing need familiarity with pure functional programming and argue that this can be taught in introductory programming courses that use Python.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented in Best Practices Track of COMPUTE 2025 (arXiv:2512.02349)</p></details> |
| **[Exploring the Potential and Limitations of Large Language Models for Novice Program Fault Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03421v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novice programmers often face challenges in fault localization due to their limited experience and understanding of programming syntax and logic. Traditional methods like Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) and Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) help identify faults but often lack the ability to understand code context, making them less effective for beginners. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in overcoming these limitations by utilizing their ability to understand program syntax and semantics. LLM-based fault localization provides more accurate and context-aware results than traditional techniques. This study evaluates six closed-source and seven open-source LLMs using the Codeflaws, Condefects, and BugT datasets, with BugT being a newly constructed dataset specifically designed to mitigate data leakage concerns. Advanced models with reasoning capabilities, such as OpenAI o3 and DeepSeekR1, achieve superior accuracy with minimal reliance on prompt engineering. In contrast, models without reasoning capabilities, like GPT-4, require carefully designed prompts to maintain performance. While LLMs perform well in simple fault localization, their accuracy decreases as problem difficulty increases, though top models maintain robust performance in the BugT dataset. Over-reasoning is another challenge, where some models generate excessive explanations that hinder fault localization clarity. Additionally, the computational cost of deploying LLMs remains a significant barrier for real-time debugging. LLM's explanations demonstrate significant value for novice programmer assistance, with one-year experience participants consistently rating them highly. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to improve debugging efficiency while stressing the need for further refinement in their reasoning and computational efficiency for practical adoption.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted for publication in The Journal of Systems & Software</p></details> |

In this paper, we focus on #nFBDD, the problem of model counting for non-deterministic read-once branching programs. The #nFBDD problem is #P-hard, and it is known that there exists a quasi-polynomial randomized approximation scheme for #nFBDD. In this paper, we provide the first FPRAS for #nFBDD. Our result relies on the introduction of new analysis techniques that focus on bounding the dependence of samples.</p></details> | <details><summary>Modif...</summary><p>Modified the proof of Lemmas 8 and 9 to fix a bug.

| **[Probabilistic energy profiler for statically typed JVM-based programming languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02738v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy consumption is a growing concern in several fields, from mobile devices to large data centers. Developers need detailed data on the energy consumption of their software to mitigate consumption issues. Previous approaches have a broader focus, such as on specific functions or programs, rather than source code statements. They primarily focus on estimating the CPU's energy consumption using point estimates, thereby disregarding other hardware effects and limiting their use for statistical reasoning and explainability. We developed a novel methodology to address the limitations of measuring only the CPU's consumption and using point estimates, focusing on predicting the energy usage of statically typed JVM-based programming languages, such as Java and Scala. We measure the energy consumption of Bytecode patterns, the translation from the programming language's source code statement to their Java Bytecode representation. With the energy measurements, we construct a statistical model using Bayesian statistics, which allows us to predict the energy consumption through statistical distributions and analyze individual factors. The model includes three factors we obtain statically from the code: data size, data type, operation, and one factor about the hardware platform the code executes on: device. To validate our methodology, we implemented it for Java and evaluated its energy predictions on unseen programs. We observe that all four factors are influential, notably that two devices of the same model may differ in energy consumption and that the operations and data types cause consumption differences. The experiments also show that the energy prediction of programs closely follows the program's real energy consumption, validating our approach. Our work presents a methodology for constructing an energy model that future work, such as verification tools, can use for their energy estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bounded Exhaustive Random Program Generation for Testing Solidity Compilers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20332v7)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By July 2025, smart contracts collectively manage roughly $120 billion in assets. With Solidity remaining the dominant language for smart contract development, the correctness of Solidity compilers has become critically important. However, Solidity compilers are bug-prone, with a recent study revealing that combinations of qualifiers in Solidity programs are the primary cause of compiler crashes, accounting for 40.5% of all historical crashes. While random program generators are widely used for compiler testing, they may be less effective at finding Solidity compiler bugs because they explore the unbounded space of possible programs rather than concentrating on the specific subspace related to bug-prone qualifiers. A promising idea for finding qualifier-related bugs is to bound the search space based on empirical evidence of where such bugs are likely to occur, specifically focusing test generation to target subspaces with rich combinations of qualifiers. To address this, we propose bounded exhaustive random program generation, a novel approach that dynamically bounds the search space, enhancing the likelihood of uncovering Solidity compiler bugs. Specifically, our method bounds the search space by generating valid program templates that abstract programs that use bug-prone qualifiers, and then uses these templates as a basis for compiler testing through exhaustive enumeration of suitable qualifiers. Mechanisms are devised to address technical challenges regarding validity and efficiency. We have implemented our novel generation approach in a new tool, Erwin. We have used Erwin to find and report 26 bugs across two Solidity compilers, solc and solang, and one Solidity static analyzer, slither. Among these, 23 were previously unknown, 18 have been confirmed, and 10 have been fixed. Evaluation results demonstrate that Erwin outperforms state-of-the-art Solidity fuzzers in bug detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Approximation schemes for covering and packing mixed-integer programs with a fixed number of constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02571v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents an algorithmic study of a class of covering mixed-integer linear programming problems which encompasses classic cover problems, including multidimensional knapsack, facility location and supplier selection problems. We first show some properties of the vertices of the associated polytope, which are then used to decompose the problem into instances of the multidimensional knapsack cover problem with a single continuous variable per dimension. The proposed decomposition is used to design a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem with a fixed number of constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approximation scheme for such a general class of covering mixed-integer programs. Moreover, we design a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme and an approximate linear programming formulation for the case with a single constraint. These results improve upon the previously best-known 2-approximation algorithm for the knapsack cover problem with a single continuous variable. Finally, we show a perfect compact formulation for the case where all variables have the same lower and upper bounds. Analogous results are derived for the packing and assignment variants of the problem.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Qudit Quantum Programming with Projective Cliffords](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16801v3)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces a novel abstraction for programming quantum operations, specifically projective Cliffords, as functions over the qudit Pauli group. Generalizing the idea behind Pauli tableaux, we introduce a type system and lambda calculus for projective Cliffords called LambdaPC, which captures well-formed Clifford operations via a Curry-Howard correspondence with a particular encoding of the Clifford and Pauli groups. Importantly, the language captures not just qubit operations, but qudit operations for any dimension $d$. Throughout the paper we explore what it means to program with projective Cliffords through a number of examples and a case study focusing on stabilizer error correcting codes.</p></details> | 44 pages |
| **[Integrating Artificial Intelligence and Mixed Integer Linear Programming: Explainable Graph-Based Instance Space Analysis in Air Transportation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01698v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper analyzes the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) with mixed integer linear programming (MILP) to address complex optimization challenges in air transportation with explainability. The study aims to validate the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for extracting structural feature embeddings from MILP instances, using the air05 crew scheduling problem. The MILP instance was transformed into a heterogeneous bipartite graph to model relationships between variables and constraints. Two neural architectures, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) were trained to generate node embeddings. These representations were evaluated using Instance Space Analysis (ISA) through linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP, t-SNE) dimensionality reduction techniques. Analysis revealed that PCA failed to distinguish cluster structures, necessitating non-linear reductions to visualize the embedding topology. The GCN architecture demonstrated superior performance, capturing global topology with well-defined clusters for both variables and constraints. In contrast, the GAT model failed to organize the constraint space. The findings confirm that simpler graph architectures can effectively map the sparse topology of aviation logistics problems without manual feature engineering, contributing to explainability of instance complexity. This structural awareness provides a validated foundation for developing future Learning to Optimize (L2O) agents capable of improving solver performance in safety-critical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, presented at XXII SITRAER 2025, in processes for submission to JATM</p></details> |
| **[Deep FlexQP: Accelerated Nonlinear Programming via Deep Unfolding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01565v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an always-feasible quadratic programming (QP) optimizer, FlexQP, which is based on an exact relaxation of the QP constraints. If the original constraints are feasible, then the optimizer finds the optimal solution to the original QP. On the other hand, if the constraints are infeasible, the optimizer identifies a solution that minimizes the constraint violation in a sparse manner. FlexQP scales favorably with respect to the problem dimension, is robust to both feasible and infeasible QPs with minimal assumptions on the problem data, and can be effectively warm-started. We subsequently apply deep unfolding to improve our optimizer through data-driven techniques, leading to an accelerated Deep FlexQP. By learning dimension-agnostic feedback policies for the parameters from a small number of training examples, Deep FlexQP generalizes to problems with larger dimensions and can optimize for many more iterations than it was initially trained for. Our approach outperforms two recently proposed state-of-the-art accelerated QP approaches on a suite of benchmark systems including portfolio optimization, classification, and regression problems. We provide guarantees on the expected performance of our deep QP optimizer through probably approximately correct (PAC) Bayes generalization bounds. These certificates are used to design an accelerated sequential quadratic programming solver that solves nonlinear optimal control and predictive safety filter problems faster than traditional approaches. Overall, our approach is very robust and greatly outperforms existing non-learning and learning-based optimizers in terms of both runtime and convergence to the optimal solution across multiple classes of NLPs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trust, Usefulness, and Dependency on AI in Programming: A Hierarchical Clustering Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.11822v1)** | 2025-11-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While AI tools are transforming programming education, their adoption in underrepresented countries remains insufficiently studied. Understanding students' trust, perceived usefulness, and dependency on AI tools is essential to improving their integration into education. For these purposes, this study surveyed 508 first-year programming students in Pampanga, Philippines and analyzed their perceptions using hierarchical clustering. Results showed four unique student profiles with varying in trust and usage intensity. While students acknowledged AI tools' benefits, dependency remained low due to limited infrastructure and insufficient exposure. High-frequency users did not necessarily report greater trust or usefulness which may indicates a complex relationship between usage patterns and perception. This study recommends that to maximize AI's educational impact, targeted interventions such as infrastructure development, training programs, and curriculum integration are necessary. This study provides empirical insights to support equitable and effective AI adoption in programming education within developing regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 tables, 2 figures</p></details> |
