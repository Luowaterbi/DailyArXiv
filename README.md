| **[A Preliminary Study on the Robustness of Code Generation by Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20197v4)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robustness is a critical factor for reliable code generation by large language models, yet most evaluations focus on correctness and overlook key issues such as missing input validation and inadequate error handling. In this work, we present the first empirical study of LLM-generated code robustness using the CoderEval benchmark. Evaluating four state-of-the-art code LLMs, we find that 35.2% of their outputs are less robust than human-written code, with over 90% of deficiencies caused by missing conditional checks-70% of which occur in the first line. Interestingly, in 63% of cases where a conditional statement is needed but absent, the "if" token still ranks among the top three predictions, suggesting implicit recognition of control flow. To address these issues, we propose RobGen, a model-agnostic framework that improves robustness without retraining. RobGen combines a line-level intervention checker, which decides whether to adjust logits for each generated line, with token-level conditional logit adjustments to promote essential control structures. Experiments show that RobGen reduces the proportion of less robust code by 10%, achieves the highest average Pass@1 (43.57), and adds minimal overhead (+33.4%). As a lightweight and adaptable solution, RobGen effectively enhances the reliability of LLM-generated code across diverse tasks.</p></details> | 10 pages |

We fine-tuned the Qwen2.5-Coder-32B model with two RL methods, Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and Odds-Ratio Preference Optimization (ORPO), using a richly annotated synthetic dataset. On the Qiskit HumanEval benchmark, ORPO reaches 56.29% Pass@1 ($\approx+10$ pp over Granite-8B-QK) and GRPO hits 49%, both beating all general-purpose baselines; on the original HumanEval they score 65.90% and 63.00%. GRPO performs well on basic tasks (44/78) and excels on intermediate ones (41/68), but neither GRPO nor ORPO solves any of the five advanced tasks, highlighting clear gains yet room for progress in AI-assisted quantum programming.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-based Vulnerability Discovery through the Lens of Code Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19117v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel in many tasks of software engineering, yet progress in leveraging them for vulnerability discovery has stalled in recent years. To understand this phenomenon, we investigate LLMs through the lens of classic code metrics. Surprisingly, we find that a classifier trained solely on these metrics performs on par with state-of-the-art LLMs for vulnerability discovery. A root-cause analysis reveals a strong correlation and a causal effect between LLMs and code metrics: When the value of a metric is changed, LLM predictions tend to shift by a corresponding magnitude. This dependency suggests that LLMs operate at a similarly shallow level as code metrics, limiting their ability to grasp complex patterns and fully realize their potential in vulnerability discovery. Based on these findings, we derive recommendations on how research should more effectively address this challenge.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code Driven Planning with Domain-Adaptive Critic](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.19077v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been widely adopted as task planners for AI agents in sequential decision-making problems, leveraging their extensive world knowledge. However, the gap between their general knowledge and environment-specific requirements often leads to inaccurate plans. To address this, existing approaches rely on frequent LLM queries to iteratively refine plans based on immediate environmental feedback, which incurs substantial query costs. However, this refinement is typically guided by short-term environmental feedback, limiting LLMs from developing plans aligned with long-term rewards. We propose Code Driven Planning with Domain-Adaptive Critic (CoPiC). Instead of relying on frequent queries, CoPiC employs LLMs to generate a diverse set of high-level planning programs, which iteratively produce and refine candidate plans. A trained domain-adaptive critic then evaluates these candidates and selects the one most aligned with long-term rewards for execution. Using high-level planning programs as planner and domain-adaptive critic as estimator, CoPiC improves planning while significantly reducing query costs. Results in ALFWorld, NetHack, and StarCraft II Unit Building show that CoPiC outperforms advanced LLM-based baselines, AdaPlanner and Reflexion, achieving an average (1) 23.33% improvement in success rate and (2) 91.27% reduction in query costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Phantora: Maximizing Code Reuse in Simulation-based Machine Learning System Performance Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.01616v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern machine learning (ML) training workloads place substantial demands on both computational and communication resources. Consequently, accurate performance estimation has become increasingly critical for guiding system design decisions, such as the selection of parallelization strategies, cluster configurations, and hardware provisioning. Existing simulation-based performance estimation requires reimplementing the ML framework in a simulator, which demands significant manual effort and is hard to maintain as ML frameworks evolve rapidly. This paper introduces Phantora, a hybrid GPU cluster simulator designed for performance estimation of ML training workloads. Phantora executes unmodified ML frameworks as is within a distributed, containerized environment. Each container emulates the behavior of a GPU server in a large-scale cluster, while Phantora intercepts and simulates GPU- and communication-related operations to provide high-fidelity performance estimation. We call this approach hybrid simulation of ML systems, in contrast to traditional methods that simulate static workloads. The primary advantage of hybrid simulation is that it allows direct reuse of ML framework source code in simulation, avoiding the need for reimplementation. Our evaluation shows that Phantora provides accuracy comparable to static workload simulation while supporting three state-of-the-art LLM training frameworks out-of-the-box. In addition, Phantora operates on a single GPU, eliminating the need for the resource-intensive trace collection and workload extraction steps required by traditional trace-based simulators. Phantora is open-sourced at https://github.com/QDelta/Phantora.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pandora: A Code-Driven Large Language Model Agent for Unified Reasoning Across Diverse Structured Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12734v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language questions (NLQs) by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and knowledge graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods either rely on employing task-specific strategies or custom-defined representations, which struggle to leverage the knowledge transfer between different SKR tasks or align with the prior of LLMs, thereby limiting their performance. This paper proposes a novel USKR framework named \textsc{Pandora}, which takes advantage of \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API to construct a unified knowledge representation for alignment with LLM pre-training. It employs an LLM to generate textual reasoning steps and executable Python code for each question. Demonstrations are drawn from a memory of training examples that cover various SKR tasks, facilitating knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks involving three SKR tasks demonstrate that \textsc{Pandora} outperforms existing unified frameworks and competes effectively with task-specific methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>New v...</summary><p>New version is arXiv:2508.17905</p></details> |
| **[SR-Eval: Evaluating LLMs on Code Generation under Stepwise Requirement Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18808v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code generation. However, existing benchmarks mainly formalize the task as a static, single-turn problem, overlooking the stepwise requirement changes and iterative workflows in real-world software development. This mismatch limits the understanding of how well LLMs can support real-world development workflows. Constructing such iterative benchmarks is challenging due to the lack of public interaction traces and the difficulty of creating discriminative, turn-specific test cases. To bridge this gap, we present SR-Eval, a benchmark specifically designed to assess LLMs on iterative code generation under Stepwise requirements Refinement. SR-Eval spans both function-level and repository-level tasks in Python and Java, enabling fine-grained and progressive evaluation across evolving requirements. The construction of SR-Eval follows a carefully designed pipeline that first leverages a multi-agent-based requirement generation method to simulate the development process and recover the multi-round interaction process from final requirements, then employs a semantic-aware discriminative test case generation component to ensure discriminative and consistent evaluation at each turn. SR-Eval comprises 443 multi-turn tasks and 1,857 questions at both function and repository levels. Using SR-Eval, we evaluate 11 representative LLMs with three prompting strategies that simulate different usage patterns. Results show that iterative code generation under stepwise requirement refinement remains highly challenging: the best-performing model achieves only 22.67% completion rate on function-level tasks and 20.00% on repository-level tasks. We further observe that prompting strategies substantially influence performance, highlighting the need for the development of advanced methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detection of security smells in IaC scripts through semantics-aware code and language processing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18790v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) automates the provisioning and management of IT infrastructure through scripts and tools, streamlining software deployment. Prior studies have shown that IaC scripts often contain recurring security misconfigurations, and several detection and mitigation approaches have been proposed. Most of these rely on static analysis, using statistical code representations or Machine Learning (ML) classifiers to distinguish insecure configurations from safe code. In this work, we introduce a novel approach that enhances static analysis with semantic understanding by jointly leveraging natural language and code representations. Our method builds on two complementary ML models: CodeBERT, to capture semantics across code and text, and LongFormer, to represent long IaC scripts without losing contextual information. We evaluate our approach on misconfiguration datasets from two widely used IaC tools, Ansible and Puppet. To validate its effectiveness, we conduct two ablation studies (removing code text from the natural language input and truncating scripts to reduce context) and compare against four large language models (LLMs) and prior work. Results show that semantic enrichment substantially improves detection, raising precision and recall from 0.46 and 0.79 to 0.92 and 0.88 on Ansible, and from 0.55 and 0.97 to 0.87 and 0.75 on Puppet, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Security smells in infrastructure as code: a taxonomy update beyond the seven sins](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18761v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Infrastructure as Code (IaC) has become essential for modern software management, yet security flaws in IaC scripts can have severe consequences, as exemplified by the recurring exploits of Cloud Web Services. Prior work has recognized the need to build a precise taxonomy of security smells in IaC scripts as a first step towards developing approaches to improve IaC security. This first effort led to the unveiling of seven sins, limited by the focus on a single IaC tool as well as by the extensive, and potentially biased, manual effort that was required. We propose, in our work, to revisit this taxonomy: first, we extend the study of IaC security smells to a more diverse dataset with scripts associated with seven popular IaC tools, including Terraform, Ansible, Chef, Puppet, Pulumi, Saltstack, and Vagrant; second, we bring in some automation for the analysis by relying on an LLM. While we leverage LLMs for initial pattern processing, all taxonomic decisions underwent systematic human validation and reconciliation with established security standards. Our study yields a comprehensive taxonomy of 62 security smell categories, significantly expanding beyond the previously known seven. We demonstrate actionability by implementing new security checking rules within linters for seven popular IaC tools, often achieving 1.00 precision score. Our evolution study of security smells in GitHub projects reveals that these issues persist for extended periods, likely due to inadequate detection and mitigation tools. This work provides IaC practitioners with insights for addressing common security smells and systematically adopting DevSecOps practices to build safer infrastructure code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fermion-to-Fermion Low-Density Parity-Check Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15323v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulating fermionic systems on qubit-based quantum computers often demands significant computational resources due to the requirement to map fermions to qubits. Thus, designing a fault-tolerant quantum computer that operates directly with fermions offers an effective solution to this challenge. Here, we introduce a protocol for fault-tolerant fermionic quantum computation utilizing fermion-to-fermion low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes. Our method employs a fermionic LDPC memory, which transfers its state to fermionic color code processors, where logical operations are subsequently performed. We propose using odd-weight logical Majorana operators to form the code space, serving as memory for the fermionic LDPC code, and provide an algorithm to identify these logical operators. We present examples showing that the coding rate of fermionic codes often matches that of qubit codes, while the logical error rate can be significantly lower than the physical error rate. Furthermore, we propose two methods for performing fermionic lattice surgery to facilitate state transfer. Finally, we simulate the dynamics of a fermionic system using our protocol, illustrating effective error suppression.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages (including supplemental material), 11 figures.

In the second part, we consider evaluation codes on some such surfaces; we first estimate their parameters, then we construct asymptotically good families of such codes, and we show that their asymptotic parameters are better than the ones of the corresponding product codes. We also consider local properties of these codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[A topological theory for qLDPC: non-Clifford gates and magic state fountain on homological product codes with constant rate and beyond the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.19375v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a topological theory for fault-tolerant quantum computation in quantum low-density parity-check (qLDPC) codes. We show that there exist hidden simplicial or CW complex structures encoding the topological data for all qLDPC and CSS codes obtained from product construction by generalizing the Freedman-Hastings code-to-manifold mapping. This is achieved by building manifolds from the Tanner graphs of the skeleton classical or quantum codes, which further form a product manifold and an associated thickened product code defined on its triangulation. One can further deformation retract the manifold back to a CW complex which supports a non-topological code with minimal overhead suitable for near-term implementation. Both types of codes admit cohomology operations including cup product which can induce non-Clifford gates. When applying this mapping to a 3D hypergraph product code obtained from the product of 3 copies of good classical expander codes, we obtain non-Clifford logical CCZ gates via constant depth circuits on a code with constant stabilizer weight $w=O(1)$, constant rate $K=\Theta(N)$, and polynomial distance $D=\Omega(N^{1/3})$. When applied to logical CCZ on 3D homological product codes consisting of the product of a pair of good quantum and classical LDPC codes, we can further improve the distance to $D=\Omega(\sqrt{N})$ exceeding the $N^{1/3}$ distance barrier implied by the Bravyi-K\"onig bound for conventional topological codes with the aid of non-Euclidean geometries. Our work suggests that it is feasible to apply native logical non-Clifford gates on qLDPC codes or directly inject high-fidelity magic states as resources ('magic state fountain') without the distillation process. For the homological product construction, the fountain can inject $\Theta(\sqrt{N})$ magic states in parallel in a single round.</p></details> | <details><summary>52 pa...</summary><p>52 pages, 24 figures.

| **[GALLa: Graph Aligned Large Language Models for Improved Source Code Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.04183v4)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Programming languages possess rich semantic information - such as data flow - that is represented by graphs and not available from the surface form of source code. Recent code language models have scaled to billions of parameters, but model source code solely as text tokens while ignoring any other structural information. Conversely, models that do encode structural information of code make modifications to the Transformer architecture, limiting their scale and compatibility with pretrained LLMs. In this work, we take the best of both worlds with GALLa - Graph Aligned Large Language Models. GALLa utilizes graph neural networks and cross-modal alignment technologies to inject the structural information of code into LLMs as an auxiliary task during finetuning. This framework is both model-agnostic and task-agnostic, as it can be applied to any code LLM for any code downstream task, and requires the structural graph data only at training time from a corpus unrelated to the finetuning data, while incurring no cost at inference time over the baseline LLM. Experiments on five code tasks with seven different baseline LLMs ranging in size from 350M to 14B validate the effectiveness of GALLa, demonstrating consistent improvement over the baseline, even for powerful models such as LLaMA3 and Qwen2.5-Coder.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |
| **[Growing with Your Embodied Agent: A Human-in-the-Loop Lifelong Code Generation Framework for Long-Horizon Manipulation Skills](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18597v1)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs)-based code generation for robotic manipulation has recently shown promise by directly translating human instructions into executable code, but existing methods remain noisy, constrained by fixed primitives and limited context windows, and struggle with long-horizon tasks. While closed-loop feedback has been explored, corrected knowledge is often stored in improper formats, restricting generalization and causing catastrophic forgetting, which highlights the need for learning reusable skills. Moreover, approaches that rely solely on LLM guidance frequently fail in extremely long-horizon scenarios due to LLMs' limited reasoning capability in the robotic domain, where such issues are often straightforward for humans to identify. To address these challenges, we propose a human-in-the-loop framework that encodes corrections into reusable skills, supported by external memory and Retrieval-Augmented Generation with a hint mechanism for dynamic reuse. Experiments on Ravens, Franka Kitchen, and MetaWorld, as well as real-world settings, show that our framework achieves a 0.93 success rate (up to 27% higher than baselines) and a 42% efficiency improvement in correction rounds. It can robustly solve extremely long-horizon tasks such as "build a house", which requires planning over 20 primitives.</p></details> | <details><summary>uploa...</summary><p>upload 9 main page - v1</p></details> |
| **[ATLAS: Benchmarking and Adapting LLMs for Global Trade via Harmonized Tariff Code Classification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.18400v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate classification of products under the Harmonized Tariff Schedule (HTS) is a critical bottleneck in global trade, yet it has received little attention from the machine learning community. Misclassification can halt shipments entirely, with major postal operators suspending deliveries to the U.S. due to incomplete customs documentation. We introduce the first benchmark for HTS code classification, derived from the U.S. Customs Rulings Online Search System (CROSS). Evaluating leading LLMs, we find that our fine-tuned Atlas model (LLaMA-3.3-70B) achieves 40 percent fully correct 10-digit classifications and 57.5 percent correct 6-digit classifications, improvements of 15 points over GPT-5-Thinking and 27.5 points over Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking. Beyond accuracy, Atlas is roughly five times cheaper than GPT-5-Thinking and eight times cheaper than Gemini-2.5-Pro-Thinking, and can be self-hosted to guarantee data privacy in high-stakes trade and compliance workflows. While Atlas sets a strong baseline, the benchmark remains highly challenging, with only 40 percent 10-digit accuracy. By releasing both dataset and model, we aim to position HTS classification as a new community benchmark task and invite future work in retrieval, reasoning, and alignment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bounds and Constructions of High-Memory Spatially-Coupled Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14064v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we apply the Clique Lov\'asz Local Lemma to provide sufficient conditions on memory and lifting degree for removing certain harmful combinatorial structures in spatially-coupled (SC) codes that negatively impact decoding performance. Additionally, we present, for the first time, a constructive algorithm based on the Moser-Tardos algorithm that ensures predictable performance. Furthermore, leveraging the properties of LLL-distribution and M-T-distribution, we establish the dependencies among the harmful structures during the construction process. We provide upper bounds on the probability change of remaining harmful structures after eliminating some of them. In particular, the elimination of 4-cycles increases the probability of 6-cycles becoming active by at most a factor of $e^{8/3}$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Privilege Escalation and Remote Code Execution Exploit Chains](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07287v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Research on exploit chains predominantly focuses on sequences with one type of exploit, e.g., either escalating privileges on a machine or executing remote code. In networks, hybrid exploit chains are critical because of their linkable vulnerabilities. Moreover, developing hybrid exploit chains is challenging because it requires understanding the diverse and independent dependencies and outcomes. We present hybrid chains encompassing privilege escalation (PE) and remote code execution (RCE) exploits. These chains are executable and can span large networks, where numerous potential exploit combinations arise from the large array of network assets, their hardware, software, configurations, and vulnerabilities. The chains are generated by ALFA-Chains, an AI-supported framework for the automated discovery of multi-step PE and RCE exploit chains in networks across arbitrary environments and segmented networks. Through an LLM-based classification, ALFA-Chains describes exploits in Planning Domain Description Language (PDDL). PDDL exploit and network descriptions then use off-the-shelf AI planners to find multiple exploit chains. ALFA-Chains finds 12 unknown chains on an example with a known three-step chain. A red-team exercise validates the executability with Metasploit. ALFA-Chains is efficient, finding an exploit chain in 0.01 seconds in an enterprise network with 83 vulnerabilities, 20 hosts, and 6 subnets. In addition, it is scalable, it finds an exploit chain in an industrial network with 114 vulnerabilities, 200 hosts, and 6 subnets in 3.16 seconds. It is comprehensive, finding 13 exploit chains in 26.26 seconds in the network. Finally, ALFA-Chains demonstrates flexibility across different exploit sources, ability to generalize across diverse network types, and robustness in discovering chains under constrained privilege assumptions.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 12 Tables, 6 Figures, 7 Listing</p></details> |
| **[SymRTLO: Enhancing RTL Code Optimization with LLMs and Neuron-Inspired Symbolic Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10369v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimizing Register Transfer Level (RTL) code is crucial for improving the power, performance, and area (PPA) of digital circuits in the early stages of synthesis. Manual rewriting, guided by synthesis feedback, can yield high-quality results but is time-consuming and error-prone. Most existing compiler-based approaches have difficulty handling complex design constraints. Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative to address these challenges. However, LLM-based approaches often face difficulties in ensuring alignment between the generated code and the provided prompts. This paper presents SymRTLO, a novel neuron-symbolic RTL optimization framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-based code rewriting with symbolic reasoning techniques. Our method incorporates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system of optimization rules and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based templates, enabling LLM-based rewriting that maintains syntactic correctness while minimizing undesired circuit behaviors. A symbolic module is proposed for analyzing and optimizing finite state machine (FSM) logic, allowing fine-grained state merging and partial specification handling beyond the scope of pattern-based compilers. Furthermore, a fast verification pipeline, combining formal equivalence checks with test-driven validation, further reduces the complexity of verification. Experiments on the RTL-Rewriter benchmark with Synopsys Design Compiler and Yosys show that SymRTLO improves power, performance, and area (PPA) by up to 43.9%, 62.5%, and 51.1%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Outer Channel of DNA-Based Data Storage: Capacity and Efficient Coding Schemes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11854v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider the outer channel for DNA-based data storage. When transmitting over the outer channel, each DNA string is treated as a unit/symbol that would be either correctly received, or erased, or corrupted by uniformly distributed random symbol substitution errors, and all strings are randomly shuffled with each other. We first derive the capacity of the outer channel, which implies that the uniformly distributed random symbol substitution errors are only as harmful as the erasure errors (for infinite-length non-binary random linear codes with near maximum likelihood decoding). Next, we propose practically efficient coding schemes which encode the bits at the same position of different strings into a codeword. We compute the soft/hard information of each bit, which allows us to independently decode the bits within a codeword, leading to an independent decoding scheme. To improve the decoding performance, we measure the reliability of each string based on the independent decoding result, and perform a further step of decoding over the most reliable strings, leading to a joint decoding scheme. Simulations with low-density parity-check codes confirm that the joint decoding scheme can reduce the frame error rate by more than 3 orders of magnitude compared to the independent decoding scheme, and it can outperform the state-of-the-art decoding scheme in the literature across a wide range of parameter regions.</p></details> |  |

This work introduces DIVERS-BENCH, a comprehensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LID models across diverse domains, including speech transcripts, web text, social media texts, children's stories, and code-switched text. Our findings reveal that while models achieve high accuracy on curated datasets, performance degrades sharply on noisy and informal inputs. We also introduce DIVERS-CS, a diverse code-switching benchmark dataset spanning 10 language pairs, and show that existing models struggle to detect multiple languages within the same sentence. These results highlight the need for more robust and inclusive LID systems in real-world settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoSIL: Issue Localization via LLM-Driven Code Graph Searching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22424v2)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Issue solving aims to generate patches to fix reported issues in real-world code repositories according to issue descriptions. Issue localization forms the basis for accurate issue solving. Recently, LLM-based issue localization methods have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance. However, these methods either search from files mentioned in issue descriptions or in the whole repository and struggle to balance the breadth and depth of the search space to converge on the target efficiently. Moreover, they allow LLM to explore whole repositories freely, making it challenging to control the search direction to prevent the LLM from searching for incorrect targets. This paper introduces CoSIL, an LLM-driven, powerful function-level issue localization method without training or indexing. CoSIL employs a two-phase code graph search strategy. It first conducts broad exploration at the file level using dynamically constructed module call graphs, and then performs in-depth analysis at the function level by expanding the module call graph into a function call graph and executing iterative searches. To precisely control the search direction, CoSIL designs a pruner to filter unrelated directions and irrelevant contexts. To avoid incorrect interaction formats in long contexts, CoSIL introduces a reflection mechanism that uses additional independent queries in short contexts to enhance formatted abilities. Experiment results demonstrate that CoSIL achieves a Top-1 localization accuracy of 43.3\% and 44.6\% on SWE-bench Lite and SWE-bench Verified, respectively, with Qwen2.5-Coder-32B, average outperforming the state-of-the-art methods by 96.04\%. When CoSIL is integrated into an issue-solving method, Agentless, the issue resolution rate improves by 2.98\%--30.5\%.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE 2025 |

| **[Table2LaTeX-RL: High-Fidelity LaTeX Code Generation from Table Images via Reinforced Multimodal Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17589v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we address the task of table image to LaTeX code generation, with the goal of automating the reconstruction of high-quality, publication-ready tables from visual inputs. A central challenge of this task lies in accurately handling complex tables -- those with large sizes, deeply nested structures, and semantically rich or irregular cell content -- where existing methods often fail. We begin with a comprehensive analysis, identifying key challenges and highlighting the limitations of current evaluation protocols. To overcome these issues, we propose a reinforced multimodal large language model (MLLM) framework, where a pre-trained MLLM is fine-tuned on a large-scale table-to-LaTeX dataset. To further improve generation quality, we introduce a dual-reward reinforcement learning strategy based on Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Unlike standard approaches that optimize purely over text outputs, our method incorporates both a structure-level reward on LaTeX code and a visual fidelity reward computed from rendered outputs, enabling direct optimization of the visual output quality. We adopt a hybrid evaluation protocol combining TEDS-Structure and CW-SSIM, and show that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance, particularly on structurally complex tables, demonstrating the effectiveness and robustness of our approach.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[MapCoder-Lite: Squeezing Multi-Agent Coding into a Single Small LLM](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17489v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have advanced code generation from single-function tasks to competitive-programming problems, but existing multi-agent solutions either rely on costly large-scale ($>$ 30B) models or collapse when downsized to small open-source models. We present MapCoder-Lite, which upgrades a single 7B model into four role-specialised agents-retriever, planner, coder, and debugger-using only rank-32, role-specific LoRA adapters ($<3\%$ extra parameters). Three lightweight techniques make this possible: (i) trajectory distillation from strong LLMs fixes format fragility in retrieval and debugging, (ii) supervisor-guided correction strengthens planning and coding agents, and (iii) agent-wise LoRA fine-tuning delivers memory-efficient specialisation. Comprehensive evaluation on xCodeEval, APPS, and CodeContests shows that MapCoder-Lite more than doubles xCodeEval accuracy (from $13.2\%$ to $28.3\%$), eliminates all format failures, and closes to within six points of a 32B baseline while cutting GPU memory and token-generation time by $4\times$. These results demonstrate that careful agent-wise fine-tuning unleashes high-quality multi-agent coding on a small language model.</p></details> |  |

Our optimization framework enforces measurement consistency via a differentiable forward model while guiding solutions with the diffusion prior in the denoised image domain, yielding higher accuracy and stability than clas- sical optimization. Unlike U-Net-style regressors, our approach requires no paired defocus-RGBD training data and does not tie training to a specific camera configuration. Experiments on comprehensive simulations and a prototype camera demonstrate consistently strong RGBD reconstructions across noise levels, outperforming both U-Net baselines and a classical coded- aperture DFD method.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLaVul: A Multimodal LLM for Interpretable Vulnerability Reasoning about Source Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17337v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Increasing complexity in software systems places a growing demand on reasoning tools that unlock vulnerabilities manifest in source code. Many current approaches focus on vulnerability analysis as a classifying task, oversimplifying the nuanced and context-dependent real-world scenarios. Even though current code large language models (LLMs) excel in code understanding, they often pay little attention to security-specific reasoning. We propose LLaVul, a multimodal LLM tailored to provide fine-grained reasoning about code through question-answering (QA). Our model is trained to integrate paired code and natural queries into a unified space, enhancing reasoning and context-dependent insights about code vulnerability. To evaluate our model performance, we construct a curated dataset of real-world vulnerabilities paired with security-focused questions and answers. Our model outperforms state-of-the-art general-purpose and code LLMs in the QA and detection tasks. We further explain decision-making by conducting qualitative analysis to highlight capabilities and limitations. By integrating code and QA, LLaVul enables more interpretable and security-focused code understanding.</p></details> |  |

This fails to reflect the holistic context-rich nature of real-world CR. To bridge this gap, we introduce CodeFuse-CR-Bench, the first comprehensiveness-aware benchmark for repository-level CR evaluation. CodeFuse-CR-Bench comprises 601 high-quality instances from 70 Python projects covering nine Pull-Request (PR) problem domains, where each instance provides rich, multi-faceted context including the associated issue, PR details, and repository state, enabling end-to-end evaluation. Beyond superficial metrics, we also propose a novel evaluation framework that combines rule-based checks for location and syntax with model-based judgments of review quality. We present the first large-scale assessment of state-of-the-art LLMs on this comprehensive CR task. Our results establish crucial baselines and reveal that (1) no single LLM dominates all aspects of CR; (2) Gemini 2.5 Pro achieves the highest comprehensive performance; and (3) different LLMs exhibit varying robustness to redundant context. These findings highlight the necessity of holistic, multi-dimensional evaluation and provide actionable insights for advancing truly intelligent yet practical CR assistants.</p></details> |  |

We establish lower bounds on the redundancy of any $(n, t)$-BRC and present code constructions that meet these bounds up to asymptotically negligible terms. Interestingly, this problem shares similarities with the recently studied torn paper channel, which has emerged in the context of DNA data storage.</p></details> |  |

However, these tools typically present suggestions without explaining their rationale, leaving their decision-making process inscrutable. This opacity hinders developers' ability to critically evaluate outputs, form accurate mental models, and calibrate trust in the system. To address this, we introduce CopilotLens, a novel interactive framework that reframes code completion from a simple suggestion into a transparent, explainable interaction. CopilotLens operates as an explanation layer that reconstructs the AI agent's "thought process" through a dynamic, two-level interface. The tool aims to surface both high-level code changes and the specific codebase context influences. This paper presents the design and rationale of CopilotLens, offering a concrete framework and articulating expectations on deepening comprehension and calibrated trust, which we plan to evaluate in subsequent work.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted at The First Workshop on the Application of LLM Explainability to Reasoning and Planning (XLLM-Reason-Plan) @ COLM 2025</p></details> |

To enable each hash bit to correspond to specific visual attributes, we propoe a novel method that harnesses learnable queries for attribute-aware hash codes learning. This method deploys a tailored set of queries to capture and represent nuanced attribute-level information within the hashing process, thereby enhancing both the interpretability and relevance of each hash bit. Building on this query-based optimization framework, we incorporate an auxiliary branch to help alleviate the challenges of complex landscape optimization often encountered with low-bit hash codes. This auxiliary branch models high-order attribute interactions, reinforcing the robustness and specificity of the generated hash codes. Experimental results on benchmark datasets demonstrate that our method generates attribute-aware hash codes and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art techniques in retrieval accuracy and robustness, especially for low-bit hash codes, underscoring its potential in fine-grained image hashing tasks.</p></details> |  |

This paper explores State Space Models (SSMs) as a promising alternative for code understanding tasks such as retrieval, classification, and clone detection. We introduce CodeSSM, the first SSM-based model trained on code corpora to assess its effectiveness. Our results demonstrate that SSMs are more sample-efficient and can extrapolate to longer contexts beyond the pretraining length. Extensive experiments show that SSMs offer a viable alternative to transformers, addressing several their limitations. Additionally, CodeSSM reduces memory usage by up to 64\% compared to transformers at a context length of 2048, with greater savings as context length grows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Error Correction Code Transformer: From Non-Unified to Unified](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03364v3)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Channel coding is vital for reliable data transmission in modern wireless systems, and its significance will increase with the emergence of sixth-generation (6G) networks, which will need to support various error correction codes. However, traditional decoders were typically designed as fixed hardware circuits tailored to specific decoding algorithms, leading to inefficiencies and limited flexibility. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a unified, code-agnostic Transformer-based decoding architecture capable of handling multiple linear block codes, including Polar, Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC), and Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH), within a single framework. To achieve this, standardized units are employed to harmonize parameters across different code types, while the redesigned unified attention module compresses the structural information of various codewords. Additionally, a sparse mask, derived from the sparsity of the parity-check matrix, is introduced to enhance the model's ability to capture inherent constraints between information and parity-check bits, resulting in improved decoding accuracy and robustness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed unified Transformer-based decoder not only outperforms existing methods but also provides a flexible, efficient, and high-performance solution for next-generation wireless communication systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[MORepair: Teaching LLMs to Repair Code via Multi-Objective Fine-tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.12636v4)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Within the realm of software engineering, specialized tasks on code, such as program repair, present unique challenges, necessitating fine-tuning Large language models~(LLMs) to unlock state-of-the-art performance. Fine-tuning approaches proposed in the literature for LLMs on program repair tasks generally overlook the need to reason about the logic behind code changes, beyond syntactic patterns in the data. High-performing fine-tuning experiments also usually come at very high computational costs. With MORepair, we propose a novel perspective on the learning focus of LLM fine-tuning for program repair: we not only adapt the LLM parameters to the syntactic nuances of the task of code transformation (objective 1), but we also specifically fine-tune the LLM with respect to the logical reason behind the code change in the training data (objective 2). Such a multi-objective fine-tuning will instruct LLMs to generate high-quality patches. We apply MORepair to fine-tune four open-source LLMs with different sizes and architectures. Experimental results on function-level and repository-level repair benchmarks show that the implemented fine-tuning effectively boosts LLM repair performance by 11.4% to 56.0%. We further show that our fine-tuning strategy yields superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art approaches, including standard fine-tuning, Fine-tune-CoT, and RepairLLaMA.</p></details> |  |
| **[DeCoMa: Detecting and Purifying Code Dataset Watermarks through Dual Channel Code Abstraction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07002v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarking is a technique to help identify the source of data points, which can be used to help prevent the misuse of protected datasets. Existing methods on code watermarking, leveraging the idea from the backdoor research, embed stealthy triggers as watermarks. Despite their high resilience against dilution attacks and backdoor detections, the robustness has not been fully evaluated. To fill this gap, we propose DeCoMa, a dual-channel approach to Detect and purify Code dataset waterMarks. To overcome the high barrier created by the stealthy and hidden nature of code watermarks, DeCoMa leverages dual-channel constraints on code to generalize and map code samples into standardized templates. Subsequently, DeCoMa extracts hidden watermarks by identifying outlier associations between paired elements within the standardized templates. Finally, DeCoMa purifies the watermarked dataset by removing all samples containing the detected watermark, enabling the silent appropriation of protected code. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of DeCoMa, covering 14 types of code watermarks and 3 representative intelligent code tasks (a total of 14 scenarios). Experimental results demonstrate that DeCoMa achieves a stable recall of 100% in 14 code watermark detection scenarios, significantly outperforming the baselines. Additionally, DeCoMa effectively attacks code watermarks with embedding rates as low as 0.1%, while maintaining comparable model performance after training on the purified dataset. Furthermore, as DeCoMa requires no model training for detection, it achieves substantially higher efficiency than all baselines, with a speedup ranging from 31.5 to 130.9X. The results call for more advanced watermarking techniques for code models, while DeCoMa can serve as a baseline for future evaluation.

| **[Bi-modal Prediction and Transformation Coding for Compressing Complex Human Dynamics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16919v1)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For dynamic human motion sequences, the original KeyNode-Driven codec often struggles to retain compression efficiency when confronted with rapid movements or strong non-rigid deformations. This paper proposes a novel Bi-modal coding framework that enhances the flexibility of motion representation by integrating semantic segmentation and region-specific transformation modeling. The rigid transformation model (rotation & translation) is extended with a hybrid scheme that selectively applies affine transformations-rotation, translation, scaling, and shearing-only to deformation-rich regions (e.g., the torso, where loose clothing induces high variability), while retaining rigid models elsewhere. The affine model is decomposed into minimal parameter sets for efficient coding and combined through a component selection strategy guided by a Lagrangian Rate-Distortion optimization. The results show that the Bi-modal method achieves more accurate mesh deformation, especially in sequences involving complex non-rigid motion, without compromising compression efficiency in simpler regions, with an average bit-rate saving of 33.81% compared to the baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quality Assessment of Tabular Data using Large Language Models and Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10572v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliable data quality is crucial for downstream analysis of tabular datasets, yet rule-based validation often struggles with inefficiency, human intervention, and high computational costs. We present a three-stage framework that combines statistical inliner detection with LLM-driven rule and code generation. After filtering data samples through traditional clustering, we iteratively prompt LLMs to produce semantically valid quality rules and synthesize their executable validators through code-generating LLMs. To generate reliable quality rules, we aid LLMs with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) by leveraging external knowledge sources and domain-specific few-shot examples. Robust guardrails ensure the accuracy and consistency of both rules and code snippets. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets confirm the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Building Coding Agents via Entropy-Enhanced Multi-Turn Preference Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12434v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software engineering presents complex, multi-step challenges for Large Language Models (LLMs), requiring reasoning over large codebases and coordinated tool use. The difficulty of these tasks is exemplified by benchmarks like SWE-bench, where current LLMs still struggle to resolve real-world issues. A promising approach to enhance performance is test-time scaling (TTS), but its gains are heavily dependent on the diversity of model outputs. While standard alignment methods such as Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) and Kahneman-Tversky Optimization (KTO) are effective at aligning model outputs with human preferences, this process can come at the cost of reduced diversity, limiting the effectiveness of TTS. Additionally, existing preference optimization algorithms are typically designed for single-turn tasks and do not fully address the complexities of multi-turn reasoning and tool integration required for interactive coding agents. To bridge this gap, we introduce EntroPO, an entropy-enhanced framework that adapts existing preference optimization algorithms to the multi-turn, tool-assisted setting. EntroPO augments the preference objective to explicitly preserve policy entropy and generalizes learning to optimize over multi-turn interactions rather than single-turn responses. We validate EntroPO by fine-tuning a diverse suite of models from different families and sizes (up to 106B parameters). To maximize performance gains from TTS, we further propose a hybrid best-trajectory selection scheme combining a learned verifier model with model free approaches. On the \swebench leaderboard, our approach establishes new state-of-the-art results among open-weight models. A 30B parameter model trained with EntroPO ranks 1st on \lite and 4th on \verified on the open-weight leaderboard, surpassed only by models with over 10x more parameters(\eg$>$350B).</p></details> |  |

However, their adoption remains limited by high computational costs, among other factors. Small Language Models (SLMs) present a lightweight alternative. While LLMs have been evaluated on competitive programming tasks, prior work often emphasizes metrics like Elo or pass rates, neglecting failure analysis. The potential of SLMs in this space remains underexplored. In this study, we benchmark three open SLMs - Llama-3.2-3B, Gemma-3-12B, and Phi-4-14B - across 280 Codeforces problems spanning Elo ratings from 800 to 2100 and covering 36 distinct topics. All models were tasked with generating Python solutions. Phi-4-14B achieved the best SLM performance with a pass@3 of 63.6%, nearing o3-mini-high (86.8%). Combining Python and C++ outputs increased Phi-4-14B's pass@6 to 73.6%. A qualitative analysis revealed some failures stemmed from minor implementation issues rather than reasoning flaws.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at International Conference on Machine Learning and Applications (ICMLA 2025)</p></details> |

Existing methods often fail to capture the subtle phonological shifts inherent in CS scenarios. The challenge is particularly difficult for language pairs like Vietnamese and English, where both distinct phonological features and the ambiguity arising from similar sound recognition are present. In this paper, we propose a novel architecture for Vietnamese-English CS ASR, a Two-Stage Phoneme-Centric model (TSPC). The TSPC employs a phoneme-centric approach, built upon an extended Vietnamese phoneme set as an intermediate representation to facilitate mixed-lingual modeling. Experimental results demonstrate that TSPC consistently outperforms existing baselines, including PhoWhisper-base, in Vietnamese-English CS ASR, achieving a significantly lower word error rate of 19.9% with reduced training resources. Furthermore, the phonetic-based two-stage architecture enables phoneme adaptation and language conversion to enhance ASR performance in complex CS Vietnamese-English ASR scenarios</p></details> | Update new version |

Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automated bug fixing and other software engineering tasks. Nevertheless, the general-purpose nature of LLM pre-training means these models often lack the capacity to perform project-specific repairs, which require understanding of domain-specific identifiers, code structures, and contextual relationships within a particular codebase. As a result, LLMs may struggle to generate correct patches when the repair depends on project-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce RelRepair, a novel approach that retrieves relevant project-specific code to enhance automated program repair. RelRepair first identifies relevant function signatures by analyzing function names and code comments within the project. It then conducts deeper code analysis to retrieve code snippets relevant to the repair context. The retrieved relevant information is then incorporated into the LLM's input prompt, guiding the model to generate more accurate and informed patches. We evaluate RelRepair on two widely studied datasets, Defects4J V1.2 and ManySStuBs4J, and compare its performance against several state-of-the-art LLM-based APR approaches. RelRepair successfully repairs 101 bugs in Defects4J V1.2. Furthermore, RelRepair achieves a 17.1\% improvement in the ManySStuBs4J dataset, increasing the overall fix rate to 48.3\%. These results highlight the importance of providing relevant project-specific information to LLMs, shedding light on effective strategies for leveraging LLMs in APR tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, under review at TSE</p></details> |

This notion gives rise to \emph{hierarchical filtrations}, refining the structure of the Picard group and providing new insights into the geometry of algebraic surfaces. We establish fundamental properties of hierarchical depth, derive inequalities through intersection theory and the Hodge index theorem, and characterize filtrations that are Hodge-tight. Using this framework, we develop a theory of \emph{hierarchical algebraic geometry codes}, constructed from evaluation spaces along these filtrations. This approach produces nested families of codes with controlled growth of parameters and identifies an optimal intermediate code maximizing a utility function balancing rate and minimum distance. Hierarchical depth thus provides a systematic method to construct AG codes with favorable asymptotic behavior, linking geometric and coding-theoretic perspectives. Our results establish new connections between line bundle theory, surface geometry, and coding theory, and suggest applications to generalized Goppa codes and higher-dimensional evaluation codes.</p></details> | Comments are welcome |

We establish some properties and prove bounds on the code distances, and show that they are not invariants of the matroid (for a linear block code) or $q$-polymatroid (for a rank-metric code) associated to the code. By means of examples, we show that the code distances allow us to distinguish some inequivalent MDS or MRD codes with the same parameters. We also show that no duality holds, i.e., the sequence of code distances of a code does not determine the sequence of code distances of its dual. Further, we define a greedy and an asymptotic version of code distances. Finally, we relate these invariants to other invariants of linear codes, such as the maximality degree, the covering radius, and the partial distances of polar codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sparse Regression LDPC Codes for the Block-Fading Non-Coherent SIMO Channel](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16376v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse regression codes (SPARCs) are a class of codes that encode information through the superposition of columns of a randomised coding matrix. The combination with an outer non-binary low density parity check (NB-LDPC) code was recently shown to improve the finite-length performance of these codes over the unfaded AWGN channel. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity approximate message passing (AMP) decoder that is capable of decoding NB-LDPC encoded SPARCs on a Rayleigh fading channel with multiple receive antennas. Notably, the decoder does not require channel state information (CSI), i.e., it is fully non-coherent, but achieves the same error probability as a decoder with full CSI, even for moderate block lengths. This is achieved by iteratively re-estimating the channel throughout the decoding iterations. In addition, we provide a rigorous asymptotic analysis of both the block error probability and the channel estimation error. Numerical results confirm the precision of the analysis and show that the presented coding scheme performs within 1.5 dB of the outage capacity and is competitive with coded modulation schemes employing standardised LDPC codes for 5G cellular networks and pilot-based channel estimation.</p></details> | <details><summary>37 pa...</summary><p>37 pages, 7 figures, submitted for publication</p></details> |

Although recent codecs achieve strong low-bitrate reconstruction and provide powerful representations for downstream tasks, most are non-streamable, limiting their use in real-time applications. We present FocalCodec-Stream, a hybrid codec based on focal modulation that compresses speech into a single binary codebook at 0.55 - 0.80 kbps with a theoretical latency of 80 ms. Our approach combines multi-stage causal distillation of WavLM with targeted architectural improvements, including a lightweight refiner module that enhances quality under latency constraints. Experiments show that FocalCodec-Stream outperforms existing streamable codecs at comparable bitrates, while preserving both semantic and acoustic information. The result is a favorable trade-off between reconstruction quality, downstream task performance, latency, and efficiency. Code and checkpoints will be released at https://github.com/lucadellalib/focalcodec.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 figure |
| **[MatchFixAgent: Language-Agnostic Autonomous Repository-Level Code Translation Validation and Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16187v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation transforms source code from one programming language (PL) to another. Validating the functional equivalence of translation and repairing, if necessary, are critical steps in code translation. Existing automated validation and repair approaches struggle to generalize to many PLs due to high engineering overhead, and they rely on existing and often inadequate test suites, which results in false claims of equivalence and ineffective translation repair. We develop MatchFixAgent, a large language model (LLM)-based, PL-agnostic framework for equivalence validation and repair of translations. MatchFixAgent features a multi-agent architecture that divides equivalence validation into several sub-tasks to ensure thorough and consistent semantic analysis of the translation. Then it feeds this analysis to test agent to write and execute tests. Upon observing a test failure, the repair agent attempts to fix the translation bug. The final (in)equivalence decision is made by the verdict agent, considering semantic analyses and test execution results. We compare MatchFixAgent's validation and repair results with four repository-level code translation techniques. We use 2,219 translation pairs from their artifacts, which cover 6 PL pairs, and are collected from 24 GitHub projects totaling over 900K lines of code. Our results demonstrate that MatchFixAgent produces (in)equivalence verdicts for 99.2% of translation pairs, with the same equivalence validation result as prior work on 72.8% of them. When MatchFixAgent's result disagrees with prior work, we find that 60.7% of the time MatchFixAgent's result is actually correct. In addition, we show that MatchFixAgent can repair 50.6% of inequivalent translation, compared to prior work's 18.5%. This demonstrates that MatchFixAgent is far more adaptable to many PL pairs than prior work, while producing highly accurate validation results.</p></details> |  |

Recent strides in Code Large Language Models (code LLMs) have spurred the development of repository-level code completion methods, yielding promising results. Nevertheless, they suffer from issues such as inappropriate query construction, single-path code retrieval, and misalignment between code retriever and code LLM. To address these problems, we introduce CodeRAG, a framework tailored to identify relevant and necessary knowledge for retrieval-augmented repository-level code completion. Its core components include log probability guided query construction, multi-path code retrieval, and preference-aligned BestFit reranking. Extensive experiments on benchmarks ReccEval and CCEval demonstrate that CodeRAG significantly and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

| **[Towards Better Code Generation: Adaptive Decoding with Uncertainty Guidance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.08980v3)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation with large language models (LLMs) is highly sensitive to token selection during decoding, particularly at decision points where uncertainty strongly affects program correctness. Conventional strategies such as greedy decoding treat all tokens uniformly and fail to capture the uncertainty characteristics unique to code, often resulting in suboptimal outputs. In this work, we conduct an empirical analysis and show that a large fraction of generation errors arises from token misranking at high-uncertainty positions, where the correct token is available but not prioritized. To address this, we introduce AdaDec, an adaptive decoding framework that employs a lookahead-based, uncertainty-aware pause-and-rerank mechanism. AdaDec automatically learns model-specific uncertainty thresholds and selectively invokes reranking when high uncertainty is detected, leveraging lookahead to refine token choice. Across HumanEval+, MBPP+, and DevEval benchmarks, AdaDec yields substantial improvements, achieving up to 20.9% absolute gains in Pass@1 accuracy compared with greedy decoding, while consistently outperforming prior adaptive decoding approaches such as AdapT. Furthermore, by applying reranking only when necessary, AdaDec reduces computational overhead and latency, enhancing efficiency alongside reliability. These findings underscore the value of uncertainty-guided decoding strategies in advancing the robustness and practicality of LLM-based code generation.</p></details> | 21 pages, 7 figures |
| **[Brevity is the Soul of Wit: Condensing Code Changes to Improve Commit Message Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15567v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Commit messages are valuable resources for describing why code changes are committed to repositories in version control systems (e.g., Git). They effectively help developers understand code changes and better perform software maintenance tasks. Unfortunately, developers often neglect to write high-quality commit messages in practice. Therefore, a growing body of work is proposed to generate commit messages automatically. These works all demonstrated that how to organize and represent code changes is vital in generating good commit messages, including the use of fine-grained graphs or embeddings to better represent code changes. In this study, we choose an alternative way to condense code changes before generation, i.e., proposing brief yet concise text templates consisting of the following three parts: (1) summarized code changes, (2) elicited comments, and (3) emphasized code identifiers. Specifically, we first condense code changes by using our proposed templates with the help of a heuristic-based tool named ChangeScribe, and then fine-tune CodeLlama-7B on the pairs of our proposed templates and corresponding commit messages. Our proposed templates better utilize pre-trained language models, while being naturally brief and readable to complement generated commit messages for developers. Our evaluation based on a widely used dataset showed that our approach can outperform six baselines in terms of BLEU-Norm, METEOR, and ROUGE-L, with average improvements of 51.7%, 78.7%, and 62.5%, respectively. The ablation study and human evaluation also provide further insights into the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[MEC-Quant: Maximum Entropy Coding for Extremely Low Bit Quantization-Aware Training](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15514v1)** | 2025-09-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantization-Aware Training (QAT) has driven much attention to produce efficient neural networks. Current QAT still obtains inferior performances compared with the Full Precision (FP) counterpart. In this work, we argue that quantization inevitably introduce biases into the learned representation, especially under the extremely low-bit setting. To cope with this issue, we propose Maximum Entropy Coding Quantization (MEC-Quant), a more principled objective that explicitly optimizes on the structure of the representation, so that the learned representation is less biased and thus generalizes better to unseen in-distribution samples. To make the objective end-to-end trainable, we propose to leverage the minimal coding length in lossy data coding as a computationally tractable surrogate for the entropy, and further derive a scalable reformulation of the objective based on Mixture Of Experts (MOE) that not only allows fast computation but also handles the long-tailed distribution for weights or activation values. Extensive experiments on various tasks on computer vision tasks prove its superiority. With MEC-Qaunt, the limit of QAT is pushed to the x-bit activation for the first time and the accuracy of MEC-Quant is comparable to or even surpass the FP counterpart. Without bells and whistles, MEC-Qaunt establishes a new state of the art for QAT.</p></details> | 7pages;on going work |
| **[LoCaL: Countering Surface Bias in Code Evaluation Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15397v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing popularity of large language models (LLMs) and LLM-based agents, reliable and effective code evaluation metrics (CEMs) have become crucial for progress across several software engineering tasks. While popular benchmarks often provide test cases to assess the correctness of generated code, crafting and executing test cases is expensive. Reference-based CEMs provide a cheaper alternative by scoring a candidate program based on its functional similarity to a reference. Although prior research has focused on reporting the weak correlation between these CEMs and functional correctness, the causes are only assumed, and plausible solutions remain unexplored. In this work, we critically evaluate four state-of-the-art reference-based CEMs, revealing their strong bias towards surface-level features rather than code functionality. Despite this surface bias, current evaluation datasets for these CEMs rarely include code pairs that are surface-similar yet functionally dissimilar, or functionally similar yet surface-dissimilar. To mitigate this gap, we propose LoCaL (Looks Can Lie), a CEM evaluation benchmark, with 3117 code pairs at both the method and program levels. Each pair is labeled with a functional similarity score and aims to target regions where CEMs are likely to perform poorly. The functional similarity scores are calculated through differential fuzzing, which eliminates the need for predefined test cases and, at the same time, improves the reliability of the scores by executing an order of magnitude more tests than prior work. We find that all four CEMs show significant performance degradation on LoCaL, compared to the baselines. Finally, based on our findings, we draw the implication that exposing CEMs to LoCaL-like data might facilitate the development of metrics that are robust to surface bias.</p></details> |  |

To address these challenges, we introduce a general and scalable benchmark construction framework that begins with manually validated, high-quality seed examples and expands them via targeted mutations. Our approach provides a comprehensive suite of artifacts so the benchmark can support comprehensive risk assessment and security capability evaluation using dynamic metrics. By combining expert insights with automated generation, we strike a balance between manual effort, data quality, and benchmark scale. Applying this framework to Python, C/C++, and Java, we build SeCodePLT, a dataset of more than 5.9k samples spanning 44 CWE-based risk categories and three security capabilities. Compared with state-of-the-art benchmarks, SeCodePLT offers broader coverage, higher data fidelity, and substantially greater scale. We use SeCodePLT to evaluate leading code LLMs and agents, revealing their strengths and weaknesses in both generating secure code and identifying or fixing vulnerabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS D&B track 2025</p></details> |

In addition, the constructions presented here result in LRCs with large availability.</p></details> |  |
| **[A.S.E: A Repository-Level Benchmark for Evaluating Security in AI-Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18106v3)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering necessitates rigorous security evaluation of their generated code. However, existing benchmarks often lack relevance to real-world AI-assisted programming scenarios, making them inadequate for assessing the practical security risks associated with AI-generated code in production environments. To address this gap, we introduce A.S.E (AI Code Generation Security Evaluation), a repository-level evaluation benchmark designed to closely mirror real-world AI programming tasks, offering a comprehensive and reliable framework for assessing the security of AI-generated code. Our evaluation of leading LLMs on A.S.E reveals several key findings. In particular, current LLMs still struggle with secure coding. The complexity in repository-level scenarios presents challenges for LLMs that typically perform well on snippet-level tasks. Moreover, a larger reasoning budget does not necessarily lead to better code generation. These observations offer valuable insights into the current state of AI code generation and help developers identify the most suitable models for practical tasks. They also lay the groundwork for refining LLMs to generate secure and efficient code in real-world applications.</p></details> |  |

[SODA 2017]. More precisely, we study codes over an $m \times n$ grid topology with one parity check per row and column of the grid along with $h \ge 1$ global parity checks. Previous works have largely focused on the setting in which $m = n$, where explicit constructions require field size which is exponential in $n$. Motivated by practical applications, we consider the regime in which $m,h$ are constants and $n$ is growing. In this setting, we provide a number of new explicit constructions whose field size is polynomial in $n$. We further complement these results with new field size lower bounds.</p></details> | 16 pages |

Due to the elusive syntax and complicated semantics in programs, most existing studies use techniques based on abstract syntax tree (AST) and graph neural networks (GNN) to create code representations for code classification. These techniques utilize the structure and semantic information of the code, but they only take into account pairwise associations and neglect the high-order data correlations that already exist between nodes of the same field or called attribute in the AST, which may result in the loss of code structural information. On the other hand, while a general hypergraph can encode high-order data correlations, it is homogeneous and undirected which will result in a lack of semantic and structural information such as node types, edge types, and directions between child nodes and parent nodes when modeling AST. In this study, we propose a heterogeneous directed hypergraph (HDHG) to represent AST and a heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) to process the graph for code classification. Our method improves code understanding and can represent high-order data correlations beyond paired interactions. We assess our heterogeneous directed hypergraph neural network (HDHGN) on public datasets of Python and Java programs. Our method outperforms previous AST-based and GNN-based methods, which demonstrates the capability of our model.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the 35th International Conference on Software Engineering and Knowledge Engineering (SEKE 2023) as a regular paper; the latest version is consistent with the official conference version</p></details> |

In 2023, Yue et al. [25] constructed three classes of LCD MDS codes via (*)-TGRS codes. Recently, Wu et al. [27] generalized the results given by Yue et al. and constructed several classes of LCD MDS codes. In this paper, we unify their constructions by defining the (*)-(L,P)-twisted generalized Reed-Solomon (in short, (*)-(L,P)-TGRS) code, give the parity-check matrix of (*)-(L,P)-TGRS codes, and then construct four classes of LCD codes. Finally, some corresponding examples are given.</p></details> | 25pages |

A Comprehensive Study on Execution Trace-Based Information for Code Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11686v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code Large Language Models (Code LLMs) have opened a new era in programming with their impressive capabilities. However, recent research has revealed critical limitations in their ability to reason about runtime behavior and understand the actual functionality of programs, which poses significant challenges for their post-training and practical deployment. Specifically, Code LLMs encounter two principal issues: (1) a lack of proficiency in reasoning about program execution behavior, as they struggle to interpret what programs actually do during runtime, and (2) the inconsistent and fragmented representation of semantic information, such as execution traces, across existing methods, which hinders their ability to generalize and reason effectively. These challenges underscore the necessity for more systematic approaches to enhance the reasoning capabilities of Code LLMs. To address these issues, we introduce a generic framework to support integrating semantic information~(e.g., execution trace) to code task-relevant prompts, and conduct a comprehensive study to explore the role of semantic information in enhancing the reasoning ability of Code LLMs accordingly. Specifically, we focus on investigating the usefulness of trace-based semantic information in boosting supervised fine-tuning~(SFT) and post-phase inference of Code LLMs. The experimental results surprisingly disagree with previous works and demonstrate that semantic information has limited usefulness for SFT and test time scaling of Code LLM.</p></details> | <details><summary>EMNLP...</summary><p>EMNLP2025-findings https://openreview.net/forum?id=d4ICISW2T4</p></details> |

| **[RulER: Automated Rule-Based Semantic Error Localization and Repair for Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14829v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code translation aims to convert programs between different programming languages while maintaining their functionality. Due to the imperfections of code translation models, the generated translations may contain errors that compromise their reliability. Existing automated debugging methods for code translation rely on code alignments and repair patch templates to locate and fix erroneous translations. However, existing methods lack reliable references to construct code alignments and design repair patch templates, which significantly impacts their localization accuracy and repair effectiveness. To address these limitations, we reintroduce code translation rules and propose a rule-based debugging method for code translation, called RulER. RulER automatically derives code translation rules from correct translations generated by LLMs, enabling the efficient collection of diverse translation rules. In addition, RulER dynamically combines the existing rules on expandable nodes like expressions and tokens to further adaptively align more statements. These rules capture clear and detailed structural correspondences between source and target programming languages. Therefore, they can serve as reliable and reusable references for code alignment and repair template design, enabling RulER to locate and fix translation errors effectively. Our evaluation of RulER on Java-to-C++ and Python-to-C++ translations produced by four code translation models demonstrates that RulER outperforms state-of-the-art methods, BatFix and TransMap. Our experimental results show that RulER outperformed the best baseline by 20% and 272% in terms of error localization rates and repair success rates, respectively. RulER exhibits superior repair performance compared to directly prompting LLMs for patch generation, demonstrating a promising methodology for extracting and leveraging coding knowledge from LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Due t...</summary><p>Due to the limitation "The abstract field cannot be longer than 1,920 characters", the abstract here is shorter than that in the PDF file</p></details> |

The ability to generate code and submit pull requests with minimal human intervention, through the use of autonomous AI agents, is poised to become a standard practice. However, little is known about the practical usefulness of these pull requests and the extent to which their contributions are accepted in real-world projects. In this paper, we empirically study 567 GitHub pull requests (PRs) generated using Claude Code, an agentic coding tool, across 157 diverse open-source projects. Our analysis reveals that developers tend to rely on agents for tasks such as refactoring, documentation, and testing. The results indicate that 83.8% of these agent-assisted PRs are eventually accepted and merged by project maintainers, with 54.9% of the merged PRs are integrated without further modification. The remaining 45.1% require additional changes benefit from human revisions, especially for bug fixes, documentation, and adherence to project-specific standards. These findings suggest that while agent-assisted PRs are largely acceptable, they still benefit from human oversight and refinement.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Use of Agentic Coding Manifests: An Empirical Study of Claude Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14744v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic coding tools receive goals written in natural language as input, break them down into specific tasks, and write/execute the actual code with minimal human intervention. Key to this process are agent manifests, configuration files (such as Claude.md) that provide agents with essential project context, identity, and operational rules. However, the lack of comprehensive and accessible documentation for creating these manifests presents a significant challenge for developers. We analyzed 253 Claude.md files from 242 repositories to identify structural patterns and common content. Our findings show that manifests typically have shallow hierarchies with one main heading and several subsections, with content dominated by operational commands, technical implementation notes, and high-level architecture.</p></details> |  |
| **[SWE-QA: Can Language Models Answer Repository-level Code Questions?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14635v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and reasoning about entire software repositories is an essential capability for intelligent software engineering tools. While existing benchmarks such as CoSQA and CodeQA have advanced the field, they predominantly focus on small, self-contained code snippets. These setups fail to capture the complexity of real-world repositories, where effective understanding and reasoning often require navigating multiple files, understanding software architecture, and grounding answers in long-range code dependencies. In this paper, we present SWE-QA, a repository-level code question answering (QA) benchmark designed to facilitate research on automated QA systems in realistic code environments. SWE-QA involves 576 high-quality question-answer pairs spanning diverse categories, including intention understanding, cross-file reasoning, and multi-hop dependency analysis. To construct SWE-QA, we first crawled 77,100 GitHub issues from 11 popular repositories. Based on an analysis of naturally occurring developer questions extracted from these issues, we developed a two-level taxonomy of repository-level questions and constructed a set of seed questions for each category. For each category, we manually curated and validated questions and collected their corresponding answers. As a prototype application, we further develop SWE-QA-Agent, an agentic framework in which LLM agents reason and act to find answers automatically. We evaluate six advanced LLMs on SWE-QA under various context augmentation strategies. Experimental results highlight the promise of LLMs, particularly our SWE-QA-Agent framework, in addressing repository-level QA, while also revealing open challenges and pointing to future research directions.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and data available at https://github.com/peng-weihan/SWE-QA-Bench</p></details> |

The proposed solution enjoys several distinct advantages, including ultra-compact representation, low delay interaction, and vivid expression/headpose animation. In particular, we propose the Internal Dimension Increase (IDI) based representation, greatly enhancing the fidelity and flexibility in rendering the appearance while maintaining reasonable representation cost. By leveraging strong statistical regularities, the visual signals can be effectively projected into controllable semantics in the three dimensional space (e.g., mouth motion, eye blinking, head rotation, head translation and head location), which are compressed and transmitted. The editable bitstream, which naturally supports the interactivity at the semantic level, can synthesize the face frames via the strong inference ability of the deep generative model. Experimental results have demonstrated the performance superiority and application prospects of our proposed IFVC scheme. In particular, the proposed scheme not only outperforms the state-of-the-art video coding standard Versatile Video Coding (VVC) and the latest generative compression schemes in terms of rate-distortion performance for face videos, but also enables the interactive coding without introducing additional manipulation processes. Furthermore, the proposed framework is expected to shed lights on the future design of the digital human communication in the metaverse.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ensembling Large Language Models for Code Vulnerability Detection: An Empirical Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.12629v2)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code vulnerability detection is crucial for ensuring the security and reliability of modern software systems. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promising capabilities in this domain. However, notable discrepancies in detection results often arise when analyzing identical code segments across different training stages of the same model or among architecturally distinct LLMs. While such inconsistencies may compromise detection stability, they also highlight a key opportunity: the latent complementarity among models can be harnessed through ensemble learning to create more robust vulnerability detection systems. In this study, we explore the potential of ensemble learning to enhance the performance of LLMs in source code vulnerability detection. We conduct comprehensive experiments involving five LLMs (i.e., DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B, CodeLlama-7B, CodeLlama-13B, CodeQwen1.5-7B, and StarCoder2-15B), using three ensemble strategies (i.e., Bagging, Boosting, and Stacking). These experiments are carried out across three widely adopted datasets (i.e., Devign, ReVeal, and BigVul). Inspired by Mixture of Experts (MoE) techniques, we further propose Dynamic Gated Stacking (DGS), a Stacking variant tailored for vulnerability detection. Our results demonstrate that ensemble approaches can significantly improve detection performance, with Boosting excelling in scenarios involving imbalanced datasets. Moreover, DGS consistently outperforms traditional Stacking, particularly in handling class imbalance and multi-class classification tasks. These findings offer valuable insights into building more reliable and effective LLM-based vulnerability detection systems through ensemble learning.</p></details> | 24 pages |

However, challenges remain in ensuring domain specificity, cost-effectiveness, and security - especially when relying on third-party APIs. This paper introduces CodeLSI, a framework that combines low-rank optimization and domain-specific instruction tuning to address these challenges. Objectives: The aim of this study is to develop and evaluate CodeLSI, a novel approach for generating high-quality code tailored to specific domains, using FMs fine-tuned on company infrastructure without dependence on external APIs. Methods: CodeLSI applies low-rank adaptation techniques to reduce the computational cost of model pre-training and fine-tuning. Domain-specific instruction tuning is employed to align code generation with organizational needs. We implemented and tested the framework on real-world JavaScript coding tasks using datasets drawn from internal software projects. Results: Experimental evaluations show that CodeLSI produces high-quality, context aware code. It outperforms baseline models in terms of relevance, accuracy, and domain fit. The use of low-rank optimization significantly reduced resource requirements, enabling scalable training on company-owned infrastructure. Conclusion: CodeLSI demonstrates that combining low-rank optimization with domain specific tuning can enhance the practicality and performance of FMs for automated code generation. This approach provides a secure, cost-efficient alternative to commercial API based solutions and supports faster, more targeted innovation in software development.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphMend: Code Transformations for Fixing Graph Breaks in PyTorch 2](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16248v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents GraphMend, a high-level compiler that eliminates FX graph breaks in PyTorch 2 programs. Although PyTorch 2 introduced TorchDynamo and TorchInductor to enable just-in-time graph compilation, unresolved dynamic control flow and unsupported Python constructs often fragment models into multiple FX graphs. These fragments force frequent fallbacks to eager mode, incur costly CPU-to-GPU synchronizations, and reduce optimization opportunities. GraphMend addresses this limitation by analyzing and transforming source code before execution. Built on the Jac compilation framework, GraphMend introduces two code transformations that remove graph breaks due to dynamic control flow and Python I/O functions. This design allows PyTorch's compilation pipeline to capture larger, uninterrupted FX graphs without requiring manual refactoring by developers. Evaluation across eight Hugging Face models shows that GraphMend removes all fixable graph breaks due to dynamic control flow and Python I/O functions, driving the break count to 0 in 6 models and reducing it from 5 to 2 in another model. On NVIDIA RTX 3090 and A40 GPUs, GraphMend achieves up to 75% latency reductions and up to 8% higher end-to-end throughput. These results demonstrate that high-level code transformation is an effective complement to PyTorch's dynamic JIT compilation pipeline, substantially improving both usability and performance.</p></details> |  |

| **[Interleaving Natural Language Prompting with Code Editing for Solving Programming Tasks with Generative AI Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14088v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, computing students often rely on both natural-language prompting and manual code editing to solve programming tasks. Yet we still lack a clear understanding of how these two modes are combined in practice, and how their usage varies with task complexity and student ability. In this paper, we investigate this through a large-scale study in an introductory programming course, collecting 13,305 interactions from 355 students during a three-day laboratory activity. Our analysis shows that students primarily use prompting to generate initial solutions, and then often enter short edit-run loops to refine their code following a failed execution. We find that manual editing becomes more frequent as task complexity increases, but most edits remain concise, with many affecting a single line of code. Higher-performing students tend to succeed using prompting alone, while lower-performing students rely more on edits. Student reflections confirm that prompting is helpful for structuring solutions, editing is effective for making targeted corrections, while both are useful for learning. These findings highlight the role of manual editing as a deliberate last-mile repair strategy, complementing prompting in AI-assisted programming workflows.</p></details> |  |

One promising avenue to improve translation accuracy is through intermediate representations, which provide structured guidance for the translation process. We investigate whether LLM-based code translation can benefit from intermediate representations, specifically in the form of natural language (NL) summaries and abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Since prompt engineering greatly affects LLM performance, we consider several ways to integrate these representations, from one-shot to chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. Using Open GPT4 8X7B and specialized StarCoder and CodeGen models on popular code translation benchmarks (CodeNet and AVATAR), we find that CoT with an intermediate NL summary performs best, with an increase of 13.8% and 6.7%, respectively, in successful translations for the best-performing model (Open GPT4 8X7B) compared to the zero-shot prompt.</p></details> |  |

While current watermarking techniques have the potential to identify the code LM to protect its IP, they have limitations when facing the more practical and complex demand, i.e., offering the individual user-level tracing in the black-box setting. This work presents CLMTracing, a black-box code LM watermarking framework employing the rule-based watermarks and utility-preserving injection method for user-level model tracing. CLMTracing further incorporates a parameter selection algorithm sensitive to the robust watermark and adversarial training to enhance the robustness against watermark removal attacks. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate CLMTracing is effective across multiple state-of-the-art (SOTA) code LMs, showing significant harmless improvements compared to existing SOTA baselines and strong robustness against various removal attacks.</p></details> |  |

Each instance is annotated by three bilingual annotators, yielding over 376K expert annotations with strong inter-annotator agreement (Fleiss' Kappa $\geq$ 0.81). The rigorously preprocessed and filtered dataset covers both Devanagari and Roman scripts and spans diverse domains, ensuring real-world linguistic coverage. Evaluation reveals that closed-source LLMs significantly outperform traditional tools and open-source models in zero-shot settings. Notably, one-shot prompting consistently boosts performance across tasks, especially in structure-sensitive predictions like POS and NER. Fine-tuning state-of-the-art LLMs on COMI-LINGUA demonstrates substantial improvements, achieving up to 95.25 F1 in NER, 98.77 F1 in MLI, and competitive MT performance, setting new benchmarks for Hinglish code-mixed text.

| **[Posterior-GRPO: Rewarding Reasoning Processes in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.05170v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning (RL) has significantly advanced code generation for large language models (LLMs). However, current paradigms rely on outcome-based rewards from test cases, neglecting the quality of the intermediate reasoning process. While supervising the reasoning process directly is a promising direction, it is highly susceptible to reward hacking, where the policy model learns to exploit the reasoning reward signal without improving final outcomes. To address this, we introduce a unified framework that can effectively incorporate the quality of the reasoning process during RL. First, to enable reasoning evaluation, we develop LCB-RB, a benchmark comprising preference pairs of superior and inferior reasoning processes. Second, to accurately score reasoning quality, we introduce an Optimized-Degraded based (OD-based) method for reward model training. This method generates high-quality preference pairs by systematically optimizing and degrading initial reasoning paths along curated dimensions of reasoning quality, such as factual accuracy, logical rigor, and coherence. A 7B parameter reward model with this method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on LCB-RB and generalizes well to other benchmarks. Finally, we introduce Posterior-GRPO (P-GRPO), a novel RL method that conditions process-based rewards on task success. By selectively applying rewards to the reasoning processes of only successful outcomes, P-GRPO effectively mitigates reward hacking and aligns the model's internal reasoning with final code correctness. A 7B parameter model with P-GRPO achieves superior performance across diverse code generation tasks, outperforming outcome-only baselines by 4.5%, achieving comparable performance to GPT-4-Turbo. We further demonstrate the generalizability of our approach by extending it to mathematical tasks. Our models, dataset, and code are publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Homomorphic encryption schemes based on coding theory and polynomials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13788v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Homomorphic encryption is a powerful cryptographic tool that enables secure computations on the private data. It evaluates any function for any operation securely on the encrypted data without knowing its corresponding plaintext. For original data $p$, $c$ denotes the ciphertext of the original plaintext $p$, i.e. $c = Encrypt_k(p)$. This is crucial for any sensitive application running in the Cloud, because we must protect data privacy even in the case when the server has falled victim to a cyber attack. The encryption scheme $Encrypt_k$ is said to be homomorphic with respect to some set of operations $\mathcal{O}$, if for any operation $\circ \in \mathcal{O}$ one can compute $Encrypt_k(p_1 \circ p_2)$ from $Encrypt_k(p_1) \circ Encrypt_k(p_2)$. Those schemes come in three forms: somewhat, partially and fully homomorphic. In this survey, we present the state of art of the known homomorphic encryption schemes based on coding theory and polynomials.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generative Image Coding with Diffusion Prior](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13768v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As generative technologies advance, visual content has evolved into a complex mix of natural and AI-generated images, driving the need for more efficient coding techniques that prioritize perceptual quality. Traditional codecs and learned methods struggle to maintain subjective quality at high compression ratios, while existing generative approaches face challenges in visual fidelity and generalization. To this end, we propose a novel generative coding framework leveraging diffusion priors to enhance compression performance at low bitrates. Our approach employs a pre-optimized encoder to generate generalized compressed-domain representations, integrated with the pretrained model's internal features via a lightweight adapter and an attentive fusion module. This framework effectively leverages existing pretrained diffusion models and enables efficient adaptation to different pretrained models for new requirements with minimal retraining costs. We also introduce a distribution renormalization method to further enhance reconstruction fidelity. Extensive experiments show that our method (1) outperforms existing methods in visual fidelity across low bitrates, (2) improves compression performance by up to 79% over H.266/VVC, and (3) offers an efficient solution for AI-generated content while being adaptable to broader content types.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Study on Thinking Patterns of Large Reasoning Models in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13758v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Currently, many large language models (LLMs) are utilized for software engineering tasks such as code generation. The emergence of more advanced models known as large reasoning models (LRMs), such as OpenAI's o3, DeepSeek R1, and Qwen3. They have demonstrated the capability of performing multi-step reasoning. Despite the advancement in LRMs, little attention has been paid to systematically analyzing the reasoning patterns these models exhibit and how such patterns influence the generated code. This paper presents a comprehensive study aimed at investigating and uncovering the reasoning behavior of LRMs during code generation. We prompted several state-of-the-art LRMs of varying sizes with code generation tasks and applied open coding to manually annotate the reasoning traces. From this analysis, we derive a taxonomy of LRM reasoning behaviors, encompassing 15 reasoning actions across four phases. Our empirical study based on the taxonomy reveals a series of findings. First, we identify common reasoning patterns, showing that LRMs generally follow a human-like coding workflow, with more complex tasks eliciting additional actions such as scaffolding, flaw detection, and style checks. Second, we compare reasoning across models, finding that Qwen3 exhibits iterative reasoning while DeepSeek-R1-7B follows a more linear, waterfall-like approach. Third, we analyze the relationship between reasoning and code correctness, showing that actions such as unit test creation and scaffold generation strongly support functional outcomes, with LRMs adapting strategies based on task context. Finally, we evaluate lightweight prompting strategies informed by these findings, demonstrating the potential of context- and reasoning-oriented prompts to improve LRM-generated code. Our results offer insights and practical implications for advancing automatic code generation.</p></details> |  |

Erasing Sensitive Memorization in Code Language Models via Machine Unlearning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13755v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Code Language Models (CLMs) have demonstrated superior performance in software engineering tasks such as code generation and summarization, recent empirical studies reveal a critical privacy vulnerability: these models exhibit unintended memorization of sensitive training data, enabling verbatim reproduction of confidential information when specifically prompted. To address this issue, several approaches, including training data de-duplication and differential privacy augmentation, have been proposed. However, these methods require full-model retraining for deployed CLMs, which incurs substantial computational costs. In this paper, we aim to answer the following research question: Can sensitive information memorized by CLMs be erased effectively and efficiently? We conduct a pioneering investigation into erasing sensitive memorization in CLMs through machine unlearning - a post-hoc modification method that removes specific information from trained models without requiring full retraining. Specifically, we first quantify the memorization risks of sensitive data within CLM training datasets and curate a high-risk dataset of 50,000 sensitive memorized samples as unlearning targets. We study two widely used gradient ascent-based unlearning approaches: the vanilla and constraint-based methods, and introduce CodeEraser, an advanced variant that selectively unlearns sensitive memorized segments in code while preserving the structural integrity and functional correctness of the surrounding code. Extensive experiments on three families of CLMs, i.e., CodeParrot, CodeGen-Mono, and Qwen2.5-Coder, validate the effectiveness and efficiency of CodeEraser in erasing targeted sensitive memorization while maintaining model utility.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 48th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026)</p></details> |
| **[SynthCoder: A Synthetical Strategy to Tune LLMs for Code Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.15495v3)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code completion is a prominent application of Large Language Models (LLMs) in software engineering. Due to the near real-time response requirements of this task, base models with small to medium-sized parameters are typically employed, supplemented by various optimization and post-training techniques. However, these optimization methods often have trade-offs, leading to a seesaw effect where performance improvements on certain datasets or metrics are accompanied by degradations on others -- sometimes even falling below the baseline model's performance. This paper proposes SynthCoder, a model that integrates leading industry practices to achieve state-of-the-art performance on the Fill-in-the-Middle (FIM) code completion task. In specific, we first construct a diverse dataset by combining Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) node extraction with heuristics that simulate developer behavior. Then we enrich our training corpus with cross-file contextual information using the BM25 algorithm and call graphs, enhancing the model's ability to perform code completion in both file-level and repository-level scenarios. As the last step, we employ a two-stage training process using the Seed-Coder-8B-Base as the base model. First, we fine-tune the model using Curriculum Learning technology. Following this, we perform alignment using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) with preference pairs generated through Rejection Sampling. Experimental results demonstrate that our final model excels on mainstream repository-level code completion benchmarks, including aiXcoder, ExecRepoBench, CrossCodeEval, and CoLT. Furthermore, our carefully curated training set effectively mitigates the model's tendency to just repeat existing code, a common issue existing in various code completion models.</p></details> |  |

An advantage of the Distribution Semantics is its suitability for implementation as a Prolog or Python library, available through two well-maintained implementations, namely ProbLog and cplint/PITA. However, current formulations of the Distribution Semantics use point-probabilities, making it difficult to express epistemic uncertainty, such as arises from, for example, hierarchical classifications from computer vision models. Belief functions generalize probability measures as non-additive capacities, and address epistemic uncertainty via interval probabilities. This paper introduces interval-based Capacity Logic Programs based on an extension of the Distribution Semantics to include belief functions, and describes properties of the new framework that make it amenable to practical applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)</p></details> |

However, previous approaches often rely on closed-source models, lack systematic reasoning, and struggle with long-form video question answering (videoQA). To address these challenges, we introduce the FS-VisPR framework, an adaptive visual program reasoning approach that balances fast reasoning for simple queries with slow reasoning for difficult ones. First, we design efficient visual modules (e.g., key clip retrieval and subtitle retrieval) to support long-form video tasks. Then, we construct a diverse and high-quality fast-slow reasoning dataset with a strong LLM to align open-source language models' ability to generate visual program workflows as FS-LLM. Next, we design a fast-slow reasoning framework with FS-LLM: Simple queries are directly solved by VideoLLMs, while difficult ones invoke visual program reasoning, motivated by human-like reasoning processes. During this process, low-confidence fast-thinking answers will trigger a second-stage slow-reasoning process, and a fallback mechanism to fast reasoning is activated if the program execution fails. Moreover, we improve visual programs through parameter search during both training and inference. By adjusting the parameters of the visual modules within the program, multiple variants are generated: during training, programs that yield correct answers are selected, while during inference, the program with the highest confidence result is applied. Experiments show that FS-VisPR improves both efficiency and reliability in visual program workflows. It achieves 50.4% accuracy on LVBench, surpassing GPT-4o, matching the performance of Qwen2.5VL-72B on VideoMME.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Simulation Programming via Typing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17343v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum simulations are designed to model quantum systems, and many compilation frameworks have been developed for executing such simulations on quantum computers. Most compilers leverage the capabilities of digital and analog quantum computers by representing quantum particle systems with Pauli strings or digital quantum circuits, making it challenging for users in physics, chemistry, and biology to program simulations effectively. QBLUE is proposed as the first programming language for describing the behaviors of quantum systems in terms of second quantization Hamiltonians. Within QBLUE, a novel type system is proposed to clearly define states across different quantum systems and treat quantum computers as quantum particle systems of specific types. The type system is compatible with the compilation of quantum simulations expressed in QBLUE for digital and analog quantum computers. With QBLUE, users can specify the desired quantum particle system and model the system on quantum computers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to the Quantum Programming Languages (QPL) 2025 conference; available from: https://qpl2025.github.io/accepted/</p></details> |
| **[Program Synthesis via Test-Time Transduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17393v2)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce transductive program synthesis, a new formulation of the program synthesis task that explicitly leverages test inputs during synthesis. While prior approaches to program synthesis--whether based on natural language descriptions or input-output examples--typically aim to generalize from training examples, they often struggle with robustness, especially in real-world settings where training examples are limited and test inputs involve various edge cases. To address this, we propose a novel framework that improves robustness by treating synthesis as an active learning over a finite hypothesis class defined by programs' outputs. We use an LLM to predict outputs for selected test inputs and eliminate inconsistent hypotheses, where the inputs are chosen via a greedy maximin algorithm to minimize the number of LLM queries required. We evaluate our approach on four benchmarks: Playgol, MBPP+, 1D-ARC, and programmatic world modeling on MiniGrid. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves program synthesis in both accuracy and efficiency. We release our code at https://github.com/klee972/SYNTRA.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Petri Nets-based Methods on Automatically Detecting for Concurrency Bugs in Rust Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.02754v3)** | 2025-09-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rust's memory safety guarantees, notably ownership and lifetime systems, have driven its widespread adoption. Concurrency bugs still occur in Rust programs, and existing detection approaches exhibit significant limitations: static analyzers suffer from context insensitivity and high false positives, while dynamic methods incur prohibitive runtime costs due to exponential path exploration. This paper presents a Petri net-based method for efficient, precise detection of Rust concurrency bugs. The method rests on three pillars: (1) A syntax-preserving program-to-Petri-net transformation tailored for target bug classes; (2) Semantics-preserving state compression via context-aware slicing; (3) Bug detection through efficient Petri net reachability analysis. The core innovation is its rigorous, control-flow-driven modeling of Rust's ownership semantics and synchronization primitives within the Petri net structure, with data operations represented as token movements. Integrated pointer analysis automates alias identification during transformation. Experiments on standard Rust concurrency benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods LockBud and Miri that are both tools of detecting concurrency bugs of Rust programs. Compared to LockBud, our approach reduces false positives by 35.7\% and false negatives by 28.3\% , which is obtained through our precise flow-sensitive pointer analysis. Compared with Miri that is a dynamic analysis tool, although Miri can obtain the same detection results, our method achieves 100% faster verification speed since our method takes a state reduce algorithm.</p></details> |  |
| **[SLICET5: Static Program Slicing using Language Models with Copy Mechanism and Constrained Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17338v1)** | 2025-09-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static program slicing is a fundamental technique in software engineering. Traditional static slicing tools rely on parsing complete source code, which limits their applicability to real-world scenarios where code snippets are incomplete or unparsable. While recent research developed learning-based approaches to predict slices, they face critical challenges: (1) Inaccurate dependency identification, where models fail to precisely capture data and control dependencies between code elements; and (2) Unconstrained generation, where models produce slices with extraneous or hallucinated tokens not present in the input, violating the structural integrity of slices. To address these challenges, we propose \ourtool, a novel slicing framework that reformulates static program slicing as a sequence-to-sequence task using lightweight language models (e.g., CodeT5+). Our approach incorporates two key innovations. First, we introduce a copy mechanism that enables the model to more accurately capture inter-element dependencies and directly copy relevant tokens from the input, improving both dependency reasoning and generation constraint. Second, we design a constrained decoding process with (a) lexical constraint, restricting outputs to input tokens only, and (b) syntactic constraint, leveraging Tree Similarity of Edit Distance (TSED) monotonicity to detect structurally invalid outputs and discard them. We evaluate \ourtool on CodeNet and LeetCode datasets and show it consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, improving ExactMatch scores by up to 27\%. Furthermore, \ourtool demonstrates strong performance on incomplete code, highlighting its robustness and practical utility in real-world development environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>3 tab...</summary><p>3 tables, 6 Figures, 12 pages</p></details> |

While recent frameworks based on Large Neighborhood Search (LNS) can accelerate the solving process, their performance is often constrained by the difficulty in generating sufficiently effective neighborhoods. To address this challenge, we propose HyP-ASO, a hybrid policy-based adaptive search optimization framework that combines a customized formula with deep Reinforcement Learning (RL). The formula leverages feasible solutions to calculate the selection probabilities for each variable in the neighborhood generation process, and the RL policy network predicts the neighborhood size. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyP-ASO significantly outperforms existing LNS-based approaches for large-scale ILPs. Additional experiments show it is lightweight and highly scalable, making it well-suited for solving large-scale ILPs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Expressive Power of Graph Neural Networks for (Mixed-Integer) Quadratic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05938v2)** | 2025-09-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quadratic programming (QP) is the most widely applied category of problems in nonlinear programming. Many applications require real-time/fast solutions, though not necessarily with high precision. Existing methods either involve matrix decomposition or use the preconditioned conjugate gradient method. For relatively large instances, these methods cannot achieve the real-time requirement unless there is an effective preconditioner. Recently, graph neural networks (GNNs) opened new possibilities for QP. Some promising empirical studies of applying GNNs for QP tasks show that GNNs can capture key characteristics of an optimization instance and provide adaptive guidance accordingly to crucial configurations during the solving process, or directly provide an approximate solution. However, the theoretical understanding of GNNs in this context remains limited. Specifically, it is unclear what GNNs can and cannot achieve for QP tasks in theory. This work addresses this gap in the context of linearly constrained QP tasks. In the continuous setting, we prove that message-passing GNNs can universally represent fundamental properties of convex quadratic programs, including feasibility, optimal objective values, and optimal solutions. In the more challenging mixed-integer setting, while GNNs are not universal approximators, we identify a subclass of QP problems that GNNs can reliably represent.</p></details> |  |

We compare neural program synthesis and test-time fine-tuning approaches on this experiment. We find that execution-guided neural program synthesis outperforms all reference algorithms in its ability to compose novel solutions. Our empirical findings also suggest that the success of TTFT on ARC-AGI lies mainly in eliciting in-distribution knowledge that the LLM otherwise fails to rely on directly.</p></details> | <details><summary>this ...</summary><p>this version fixes errors in AlphaEvolve total % calculation, Table 3 DSL description, and adds clarifications in response to review criticisms</p></details> |

We argue that successfully deploying AI software engineers requires a level of trust equal to or even greater than the trust established by human-driven software engineering practices. The recent trend toward LLM agents offers a path toward integrating the power of LLMs to create new code with the power of analysis tools to increase trust in the code. This opinion piece comments on whether LLM agents could dominate software engineering workflows in the future and whether the focus of programming will shift from programming at scale to programming with trust.</p></details> | 5 pages |

Euclidean Jordan algebras capture many important mathematical structures and form the foundation of linear programming, second-order cone programming, and semidefinite programming. Our main contribution is a generic Gaussian mechanism for such functions, with sensitivity measured in $\ell_2$, $\ell_1$, and $\ell_\infty$ norms. Notably, this framework includes the important case where the function outputs are symmetric matrices, and sensitivity is measured in the Frobenius, nuclear, or spectral norm. We further derive private algorithms for solving symmetric cone programs under various settings, using a combination of the multiplicative weights update method and our generic Gaussian mechanism. As an application, we present differentially private algorithms for semidefinite programming, resolving a major open question posed by [Hsu, Roth, Roughgarden, and Ullman, ICALP 2014].</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[RelRepair: Enhancing Automated Program Repair by Retrieving Relevant Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16701v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) has emerged as a promising paradigm for reducing debugging time and improving the overall efficiency of software development. Recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their potential for automated bug fixing and other software engineering tasks. Nevertheless, the general-purpose nature of LLM pre-training means these models often lack the capacity to perform project-specific repairs, which require understanding of domain-specific identifiers, code structures, and contextual relationships within a particular codebase. As a result, LLMs may struggle to generate correct patches when the repair depends on project-specific information. To address this limitation, we introduce RelRepair, a novel approach that retrieves relevant project-specific code to enhance automated program repair. RelRepair first identifies relevant function signatures by analyzing function names and code comments within the project. It then conducts deeper code analysis to retrieve code snippets relevant to the repair context. The retrieved relevant information is then incorporated into the LLM's input prompt, guiding the model to generate more accurate and informed patches. We evaluate RelRepair on two widely studied datasets, Defects4J V1.2 and ManySStuBs4J, and compare its performance against several state-of-the-art LLM-based APR approaches. RelRepair successfully repairs 101 bugs in Defects4J V1.2. Furthermore, RelRepair achieves a 17.1\% improvement in the ManySStuBs4J dataset, increasing the overall fix rate to 48.3\%. These results highlight the importance of providing relevant project-specific information to LLMs, shedding light on effective strategies for leveraging LLMs in APR tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, under review at TSE</p></details> |

Rethinking Output Validation in Quantum Program Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16595v1)** | 2025-09-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As quantum computing continues to emerge, ensuring the quality of quantum programs has become increasingly critical. Quantum program testing has emerged as a prominent research area within the scope of quantum software engineering. While numerous approaches have been proposed to address quantum program quality assurance, our analysis reveals that most existing methods rely on measurement-based validation in practice. However, due to the inherently probabilistic nature of quantum programs, measurement-based validation methods face significant limitations. To investigate these limitations, we conducted an empirical study of recent research on quantum program testing, analyzing measurement-based validation methods in the literature. Our analysis categorizes existing measurement-based validation methods into two groups: distribution-level validation and output-value-level validation. We then compare measurement-based validation with statevector-based validation methods to evaluate their pros and cons. Our findings demonstrate that measurement-based validation is suitable for straightforward assessments, such as verifying the existence of specific output values, while statevector-based validation proves more effective for complicated tasks such as assessing the program behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will be appeared in the proceedings of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2025), NIER track, Seoul, South Korea, November 16 -20, 2025</p></details> |

We introduce EquiBench, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs through equivalence checking, i.e., determining whether two programs produce identical outputs for all possible inputs. Unlike prior code generation benchmarks, this task directly tests a model's ability to reason about program semantics. EquiBench consists of 2400 program pairs across four languages and six categories. These pairs are generated through program analysis, compiler scheduling, and superoptimization, ensuring high-confidence labels, nontrivial difficulty, and full automation. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art LLMs and find that in the most challenging categories, the best accuracies are 63.8% and 76.2%, only modestly above the 50% random baseline. Further analysis reveals that models often rely on syntactic similarity rather than exhibiting robust reasoning about program semantics, highlighting current limitations.

However, Rust permits the use of unsafe code, which bypasses compiler-enforced safety checks and can introduce memory vulnerabilities. A widely adopted approach for detecting memory safety bugs in Rust is Address Sanitizer (ASan). Optimized versions, such as ERASan and RustSan, have been proposed to selectively apply security checks in order to reduce performance overhead. However, these tools still incur significant performance and memory overhead and fail to detect many classes of memory safety vulnerabilities due to the inherent limitations of ASan. In this paper, we present LiteRSan, a novel memory safety sanitizer that addresses the limitations of prior approaches. By leveraging Rust's unique ownership model, LiteRSan performs Rust-specific static analysis that is aware of pointer lifetimes to identify risky pointers. It then selectively instruments risky pointers to enforce only the necessary spatial or temporal memory safety checks. Consequently, LiteRSan introduces significantly lower runtime overhead (18.84% versus 152.05% and 183.50%) and negligible memory overhead (0.81% versus 739.27% and 861.98%) compared with existing ASan-based sanitizers while being capable of detecting memory safety bugs that prior techniques miss.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages (main text), 18 pages including references and appendix, 2 figures</p></details> |

The field functions as an intellectual contest within computer science education and is marked by rapid iteration, real-time feedback, transparent solutions, and strict integrity norms. Prior work has evaluated LLMs performance on contest problems, but little is known about how human stakeholders -- contestants, problem setters, coaches, and platform stewards -- are adapting their workflows and contest norms under LLMs-induced shifts. At the same time, rising AI-assisted misuse and inconsistent governance expose urgent gaps in sustaining fairness and credibility. Drawing on 37 interviews spanning all four roles and a global survey of 207 contestants, we contribute: (i) an empirical account of evolving workflows, (ii) an analysis of contested fairness norms, and (iii) a chess-inspired governance approach with actionable measures -- real-time LLMs checks in online contests, peer co-monitoring and reporting, and cross-validation against offline performance -- to curb LLMs-assisted misuse while preserving fairness, transparency, and credibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Weighted Automata for Exact Inference in Discrete Probabilistic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.15074v1)** | 2025-09-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In probabilistic programming, the inference problem asks to determine a program's posterior distribution conditioned on its "observe" instructions. Inference is challenging, especially when exact rather than approximate results are required. Inspired by recent work on probability generating functions (PGFs), we propose encoding distributions on $\mathbb{N}^k$ as weighted automata over a commutative alphabet with $k$ symbols. Based on this, we map the semantics of various imperative programming statements to automata-theoretic constructions. For a rich class of programs, this results in an effective translation from prior to posterior distribution, both encoded as automata. We prove that our approach is sound with respect to a standard operational program semantics.</p></details> |  |

Building on the original Framework for AI-driven Code Generation Evaluation (FACE), the authors retrofit the pipeline to work entirely offline through the Ollama runtime, collapsing FACE's sprawling per-problem directory tree into a handful of consolidated JSON files, and adding robust checkpointing so multi-day runs can resume after failures. The enhanced framework generates, submits, and records solutions for the full Kattis corpus of 3,589 problems across eight code-oriented models ranging from 6.7-9 billion parameters. The submission results show that the overall pass@1 accuracy is modest for the local models, with the best models performing at approximately half the acceptance rate of the proprietary models, Gemini 1.5 and ChatGPT-4. These findings expose a persistent gap between private, cost-controlled LLM deployments and state-of-the-art proprietary services, yet also highlight the rapid progress of open models and the practical benefits of an evaluation workflow that organizations can replicate on in-house hardware.</p></details> | <details><summary>Comme...</summary><p>Comments: 16 pages, 3 figures, 8 tables, accepted to CCSC Eastern 2025</p></details> |

Generating these programs from nonparametric data such as point clouds and meshes remains a crucial yet challenging task, typically requiring extensive manual intervention. Current deep generative models aimed at automating CAD generation are significantly limited by imbalanced and insufficiently large datasets, particularly those lacking representation for complex CAD programs. To address this, we introduce GenCAD-3D, a multimodal generative framework utilizing contrastive learning for aligning latent embeddings between CAD and geometric encoders, combined with latent diffusion models for CAD sequence generation and retrieval. Additionally, we present SynthBal, a synthetic data augmentation strategy specifically designed to balance and expand datasets, notably enhancing representation of complex CAD geometries. Our experiments show that SynthBal significantly boosts reconstruction accuracy, reduces the generation of invalid CAD models, and markedly improves performance on high-complexity geometries, surpassing existing benchmarks. These advancements hold substantial implications for streamlining reverse engineering and enhancing automation in engineering design. We will publicly release our datasets and code, including a set of 51 3D-printed and laser-scanned parts on our project site.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 fig...</summary><p>9 figures, 15 pages.

| **[Effort-Optimized, Accuracy-Driven Labelling and Validation of Test Inputs for DL Systems: A Mixed-Integer Linear Programming Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.04990v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software systems increasingly include AI components based on deep learning (DL). Reliable testing of such systems requires near-perfect test-input validity and label accuracy, with minimal human effort. Yet, the DL community has largely overlooked the need to build highly accurate datasets with minimal effort, since DL training is generally tolerant of labelling errors. This challenge, instead, reflects concerns more familiar to software engineering, where a central goal is to construct high-accuracy test inputs, with accuracy as close to 100% as possible, while keeping associated costs in check. In this article we introduce OPAL, a human-assisted labelling method that can be configured to target a desired accuracy level while minimizing the manual effort required for labelling. The main contribution of OPAL is a mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) formulation that minimizes labelling effort subject to a specified accuracy target. To evaluate OPAL we instantiate it for two tasks in the context of testing vision systems: automatic labelling of test inputs and automated validation of test inputs. Our evaluation, based on more than 2500 experiments performed on seven datasets, comparing OPAL with eight baseline methods, shows that OPAL, relying on its MILP formulation, achieves an average accuracy of 98.8%, while cutting manual labelling by more than half. OPAL significantly outperforms automated labelling baselines in labelling accuracy across all seven datasets, when all methods are provided with the same manual-labelling budget. For automated test-input validation, on average, OPAL reduces manual effort by 28.8% while achieving 4.5% higher accuracy than the SOTA test-input validation baselines. Finally, we show that augmenting OPAL with an active-learning loop leads to an additional 4.5% reduction in required manual labelling, without compromising accuracy.</p></details> |  |

We focus on universal PPs featuring sampling from arbitrary measures and conditioning/reweighting in unbounded loops. We first equip Probabilistic Program Graphs (PPGs), an automata-theoretic description format of PPs, with an expectation-based semantics over infinite execution traces, which also incorporates trace weights. We then prove a finite approximation theorem that provides bounds to this semantics based on expectations taken over finite, fixed-length traces. This enables us to frame our semantics within a Feynman-Kac (FK) model, and ensures the consistency of the Particle Filtering (PF) algorithm, an instance of SMC, with respect to our semantics. Building on these results, we introduce VPF, a vectorized version of the PF algorithm tailored to PPGs and our semantics. Experiments conducted with a proof-of-concept implementation of VPF show very promising results compared to state-of-the-art PP inference tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings GandALF 2025, arXiv:2509.13258</p></details> |
| **[Interleaving Natural Language Prompting with Code Editing for Solving Programming Tasks with Generative AI Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.14088v1)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nowadays, computing students often rely on both natural-language prompting and manual code editing to solve programming tasks. Yet we still lack a clear understanding of how these two modes are combined in practice, and how their usage varies with task complexity and student ability. In this paper, we investigate this through a large-scale study in an introductory programming course, collecting 13,305 interactions from 355 students during a three-day laboratory activity. Our analysis shows that students primarily use prompting to generate initial solutions, and then often enter short edit-run loops to refine their code following a failed execution. We find that manual editing becomes more frequent as task complexity increases, but most edits remain concise, with many affecting a single line of code. Higher-performing students tend to succeed using prompting alone, while lower-performing students rely more on edits. Student reflections confirm that prompting is helpful for structuring solutions, editing is effective for making targeted corrections, while both are useful for learning. These findings highlight the role of manual editing as a deliberate last-mile repair strategy, complementing prompting in AI-assisted programming workflows.</p></details> |  |

Task and motion planning (TAMP) addresses this by combining symbolic planning and continuous trajectory generation. Recently, foundation model approaches to TAMP have presented impressive results, including fast planning times and the execution of natural language instructions. Yet, the optimal interface between high-level planning and low-level motion generation remains an open question: prior approaches are limited by either too much abstraction (e.g., chaining simplified skill primitives) or a lack thereof (e.g., direct joint angle prediction). Our method introduces a novel technique employing a form of meta-optimization to address these issues by: (i) using program search over trajectory optimization problems as an interface between a foundation model and robot control, and (ii) leveraging a zero-order method to optimize numerical parameters in the foundation model output. Results on challenging object manipulation and drawing tasks confirm that our proposed method improves over prior TAMP approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages main text, 11 pages appendix, accepted at the 9th Annual Conference on Robot Learning (CoRL 2025)</p></details> |

This course is offered to undergraduate and graduate students during Fall 2024 and Spring 2025. The course began with foundational concepts in GPU/CPU hardware and parallel computing and progressed to develop RAG and optimizing them using GPUs. Students gained experience provisioning and configuring cloud-based GPU instances, implementing parallel algorithms, and deploying scalable AI solutions. We evaluated learning outcomes through assessments, course evaluations, and anonymous surveys. The results reveal that (1) AWS served as an effective and economical platform for practical GPU programming, (2) experiential learning significantly enhanced technical proficiency and engagement, and (3) the course strengthened students' problem-solving and critical thinking skills through tools such as TensorBoard and HPC profilers, which exposed performance bottlenecks and scaling issues. Our findings underscore the pedagogical value of integrating parallel computing into STEM education. We advocate for broader adoption of similar electives across STEM curricula to prepare students for the demands of modern, compute-intensive fields.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Reactive Grasping via Task-Space Velocity Fields and Joint-Space Quadratic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.01044v2)** | 2025-09-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a fast and reactive grasping framework that combines task-space velocity fields with joint-space Quadratic Program (QP) in a hierarchical structure. Reactive, collision-free global motion planning is particularly challenging for high-DoF systems, as simultaneous increases in state dimensionality and planning horizon trigger a combinatorial explosion of the search space, making real-time planning intractable. To address this, we plan globally in a lower-dimensional task space, such as fingertip positions, and track locally in the full joint space while enforcing all constraints. This approach is realized by constructing velocity fields in multiple task-space coordinates (or, in some cases, a subset of joint coordinates) and solving a weighted joint-space QP to compute joint velocities that track these fields with appropriately assigned priorities. Through simulation experiments and real-world tests using the recent pose-tracking algorithm FoundationPose, we verify that our method enables high-DoF arm-hand systems to perform real-time, collision-free reaching motions while adapting to dynamic environments and external disturbances.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 12 figures, under review</p></details> |

| **[Trajectory Tracking with Reachability-Guided Quadratic Programming and Freeze-Resume](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13501v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many robotic systems must follow planned paths yet pause safely and resume when people or objects intervene. We present an output-space method for systems whose tracked output can be feedback-linearized to a double integrator (e.g., manipulators). The approach has two parts. Offline, we perform a pre-run reachability check to verify that the motion plan respects speed and acceleration magnitude limits. Online, we apply a quadratic program to track the motion plan under the same limits. We use a one-step reachability test to bound the maximum disturbance the system is capable of rejecting. When the state coincides with the reference path we recover perfect tracking in the deterministic case, and we correct errors using a KKT-inspired weight. We demonstrate that safety stops and unplanned deviations are handled efficiently, and the system returns to the motion plan without replanning. We demonstrate our system's improved performance over pure pursuit in simulation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evolution of Programmers' Trust in Generative AI Programming Assistants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13253v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivation. Trust in generative AI programming assistants is a vital attitude that impacts how programmers use those programming assistants. Programmers that are over-trusting may be too reliant on their tools, leading to incorrect or vulnerable code; programmers that are under-trusting may avoid using tools that can improve their productivity and well-being. Methods. Since trust is a dynamic attitude that may change over time, this study aims to understand programmers' evolution of trust after immediate (one hour) and extended (10 days) use of GitHub Copilot. We collected survey data from 71 upper-division computer science students working on a legacy code base, representing a population that is about to enter the workforce. In this study, we quantitatively measure student trust levels and qualitatively uncover why student trust changes. Findings. Student trust, on average, increased over time. After completing a project with Copilot, however, students felt that Copilot requires a competent programmer to complete some tasks manually. Students mentioned that seeing Copilot's correctness, understanding how Copilot uses context from the code base, and learning some basics of natural language processing contributed to their elevated trust. Implications. Our study helps instructors and industry managers understand the factors that influence how students calibrate their trust with AI assistants. We make four pedagogical recommendations, which are that CS educators should 1) provide opportunities for students to work with Copilot on challenging software engineering tasks to calibrate their trust, 2) teach traditional skills of comprehending, debugging, and testing so students can verify output, 3) teach students about the basics of natural language processing, and 4) explicitly introduce and demonstrate the range of features available in Copilot.</p></details> | <details><summary>Koli ...</summary><p>Koli Calling 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[A Linear Programming Framework for Optimal Event-Triggered LQG Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10671v2)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This letter explores intelligent scheduling of sensor-to-controller communication in networked control systems, particularly when data transmission incurs a cost. While the optimal controller in a standard linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) setup can be computed analytically, determining the optimal times to transmit sensor data remains computationally and analytically challenging. We show that, through reformulation and the introduction of auxiliary binary variables, the scheduling problem can be cast as a computationally efficient mixed-integer linear program (MILP). This formulation not only simplifies the analysis but also reveals structural insights and provides clear decision criteria at each step. Embedding the approach within a model predictive control (MPC) framework enables dynamic adaptation, and we prove that the resulting scheduler performs at least as well as any deterministic strategy (e.g., periodic strategy). Simulation results further demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms traditional periodic scheduling.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pleasant Imperative Program Proofs with GallinaC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13019v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Even with the increase of popularity of functional programming, imperative programming remains a key programming paradigm, especially for programs operating at lower levels of abstraction. When such software offers key components of a Trusted Computing Base (TCB), e.g. an operating system kernel, it becomes desirable to provide mathematical correctness proofs. However, current real-world imperative programming languages possess "expressive", i.e. overly permissive, semantics. Thus, producing correctness proofs of such programs becomes tedious and error-prone, requiring to take care of numerous "administrative" details. Ideally, a proof-oriented imperative language should feature well-behaved semantics while allowing imperative idioms. To obtain a high-degree of confidence in the correctness of such a language, its tools should be developed inside a proof-assistant such that program proofs are machine checked. We present GallinaC, a shallow embedding of a Turing-complete imperative language directly inside the functional programming language of the Rocq proof assistant, Gallina. In particular, it features a truly generic and unbounded while loop. Having a functional core means proofs about GallinaC programs may use the same tactics as proofs about pure functional ones. Work on GallinaC is still under progress, but we present first promising results. A prototype implementation has shown the viability of GallinaC with the correctness proof of a list reversal procedure for linked-lists of unknown size. We currently focus on the forward simulation between the GallinaC intermediate representation (IR) and Cminor, the entry language of the CompCert back-end.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings FROM 2025, arXiv:2509.11877</p></details> |
| **[Efficient Compilation of Algorithms into Compact Linear Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.13006v1)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear Programming (LP) is widely applied in industry and is a key component of various other mathematical problem-solving techniques. Recent work introduced an LP compiler translating polynomial-time, polynomial-space algorithms into polynomial-size LPs using intuitive high-level programming languages, offering a promising alternative to manually specifying each set of constraints through Algebraic Modeling Languages (AMLs). However, the resulting LPs, while polynomial in size, are often extremely large, posing challenges for existing LP solvers. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for generating substantially smaller LPs from algorithms. Our goal is to establish minimum-size compact LP formulations for problems in P having natural formulations with exponential extension complexities. Our broader vision is to enable the systematic generation of Compact Integer Programming (CIP) formulations for problems with exponential-size IPs having polynomial-time separation oracles. To this end, we introduce a hierarchical linear pipelining technique that decomposes nested program structures into synchronized regions with well-defined execution transitions -- functions of compile-time parameters. This decomposition allows us to localize LP constraints and variables within each region, significantly reducing LP size without the loss of generality, ensuring the resulting LP remains valid for all inputs of size $n$. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our method on two benchmark problems -- the makespan problem, which has exponential extension complexity, and the weighted minimum spanning tree problem -- both of which have exponential-size natural LPs. Our results show up to a $25$-fold reduction in LP size and substantial improvements in solver performance across both commercial and non-commercial LP solvers.</p></details> | <details><summary>Preli...</summary><p>Preliminary version will appear in CASCON 2025</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing Automated Loop Invariant Generation for Complex Programs with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10483v3)** | 2025-09-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program verification has always been an important component of building trustworthy software. While the analysis of real-world programs remains a theoretical challenge, the automation of loop invariant analysis has effectively resolved the problem. However, real-world programs that often mix complex data structures and control flows pose challenges to traditional loop invariant generation tools. To enhance the applicability of invariant generation techniques, we proposed ACInv, an Automated Complex program loop Invariant generation tool, which combines static analysis with Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate the proper loop invariants. We utilize static analysis to extract the necessary information for each loop and embed it into prompts for the LLM to generate invariants for each loop. Subsequently, we employ an LLM-based evaluator to assess the generated invariants, refining them by either strengthening, weakening, or rejecting them based on their correctness, ultimately obtaining enhanced invariants. We conducted experiments on ACInv, which showed that ACInv outperformed previous tools on data sets with data structures, and maintained similar performance to the state-of-the-art tool AutoSpec on numerical programs without data structures. For the total data set, ACInv can solve 21% more examples than AutoSpec and can generate reference data structure templates.</p></details> | 26 pages, 11 figures |
| **[MTP: A Meaning-Typed Language Abstraction for AI-Integrated Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08965v6)** | 2025-09-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software development is shifting from traditional programming to AI-integrated applications that leverage generative AI and large language models (LLMs) during runtime. However, integrating LLMs remains complex, requiring developers to manually craft prompts and process outputs. Existing tools attempt to assist with prompt engineering, but often introduce additional complexity. This paper presents Meaning-Typed Programming (MTP), a novel paradigm that abstracts LLM integration through intuitive language-level constructs. By leveraging the inherent semantic richness of code, MTP automates prompt generation and response handling without additional developer effort. We introduce the (1) by operator for seamless LLM invocation, (2) MT-IR, a meaning-based intermediate representation for semantic extraction, and (3) MT-Runtime, an automated system for managing LLM interactions. We implement MTP in Jac, a programming language that supersets Python, and find that MTP significantly reduces coding complexity while maintaining accuracy and efficiency. MTP significantly reduces development complexity, lines of code modifications needed, and costs while improving run-time performance and maintaining or exceeding the accuracy of existing approaches. Our user study shows that developers using MTP completed tasks 3.2x faster with 45% fewer lines of code compared to existing frameworks. Moreover, MTP demonstrates resilience even when up to 50% of naming conventions are degraded, demonstrating robustness to suboptimal code. MTP is developed as part of the Jaseci open-source project, and is available under the module byLLM.</p></details> | OOPSLA 2025 |

| **[Optimal Micro-Transit Zoning via Clique Generation and Integer Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11445v1)** | 2025-09-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Micro-transit services offer a promising solution to enhance urban mobility and access, particularly by complementing existing public transit. However, effectively designing these services requires determining optimal service zones for these on-demand shuttles, a complex challenge often constrained by operating budgets and transit agency priorities. This paper presents a novel two-phase algorithmic framework for designing optimal micro-transit service zones based on the objective of maximizing served demand. A key innovation is our adaptation of the shareability graph concept from its traditional use in dynamic trip assignment to the distinct challenge of static spatial zoning. We redefine shareability by considering geographical proximity within a specified diameter constraint, rather than trip characteristics. In Phase 1, the framework employs a highly scalable algorithm to generate a comprehensive set of candidate zones. In Phase 2, it formulates the selection of a specified number of zones as a Weighted Maximum Coverage Problem, which can be efficiently solved by an integer programming solver. Evaluations on real-world data from Chattanooga, TN, and synthetic datasets show that our framework outperforms a baseline algorithm, serving 27.03% more demand in practice and up to 49.5% more demand in synthetic settings.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at IEEE ITSC 2025 (International Conference on Intelligent Transportation Systems)</p></details> |

(Here, $e_1,\ldots, e_n$ denote the elementary symmetric polynomials in $n$ variables.) These results should be viewed in light of known results on models such as algebraic circuits, (general) algebraic branching programs, formulas and constant-depth circuits, all of which are known to be closed under these operations. To prove non-closure under factoring, we construct hard polynomials based on expander graphs using gadgets that lift their hardness from sparse polynomials to roABPs. For symmetric compositions, we show that the circulant polynomial requires roABPs of exponential size in every variable order.</p></details> | 25 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Automating the Derivation of Unification Algorithms: A Case Study in Deductive Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11136v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The unification algorithm has long been a target for program synthesis research, but a fully automatic derivation remains a research goal. In deductive program synthesis, computer programming is phrased as a task in theorem proving; a declarative specification is expressed in logical form and presented to an automatic theorem prover, and a program meeting the specification is extracted from the proof. The correctness of the program is supported by the proof, which also provides an explanation of how the program works. The proof is conducted in an appropriate axiomatic subject-domain theory, which defines the concepts in the specification and the constructs in the target programming language and provides the background knowledge necessary to connect them. For the unification proof, we generalize and automate the manual proof presented in Manna and Waldinger [1981]. The new program unifies two given symbolic expressions (s-expressions) relative to a given "environment" substitution. The proof establishes the existence of an output substitution that is a most-general idempotent unifier of the given expressions and is an "extension" of the environment substitution. If no such substitution exists and the expressions are not unifiable, the program is to produce a failure indicator. Initially the environment substitution is the empty substitution, which makes no replacements at all; during execution of recursive calls, the environment substitution records the replacements that have been found so far. Our own unification algorithm employs an environment, and such algorithms appear in the literature [e.g., Luger and Stubblefield, 1997]. We suspect, in addition to being more efficient, the three-argument algorithm with an environment is easier to synthesize automatically than the two-argument version from the Manna-Waldinger paper.</p></details> | 92 pages |
| **[Humanizing Automated Programming Feedback: Fine-Tuning Generative Models with Student-Written Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10647v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing need for automated and personalized feedback in programming education has led to recent interest in leveraging generative AI for feedback generation. However, current approaches tend to rely on prompt engineering techniques in which predefined prompts guide the AI to generate feedback. This can result in rigid and constrained responses that fail to accommodate the diverse needs of students and do not reflect the style of human-written feedback from tutors or peers. In this study, we explore learnersourcing as a means to fine-tune language models for generating feedback that is more similar to that written by humans, particularly peer students. Specifically, we asked students to act in the flipped role of a tutor and write feedback on programs containing bugs. We collected approximately 1,900 instances of student-written feedback on multiple programming problems and buggy programs. To establish a baseline for comparison, we analyzed a sample of 300 instances based on correctness, length, and how the bugs are described. Using this data, we fine-tuned open-access generative models, specifically Llama3 and Phi3. Our findings indicate that fine-tuning models on learnersourced data not only produces feedback that better matches the style of feedback written by students, but also improves accuracy compared to feedback generated through prompt engineering alone, even though some student-written feedback is incorrect. This surprising finding highlights the potential of student-centered fine-tuning to improve automated feedback systems in programming education.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM) 2025</p></details> |

Yet, little is known about how novices interact with GenAI tools and their feedback quality in the form of audio output. This paper analyzes audio dialogues from nine 9th-grade students using a voice-enabled tutor (powered by OpenAI's Realtime API) in an authentic classroom setting while learning Python. We examined the students' voice prompts and AI's responses (1210 messages) by using qualitative coding. We also gathered students' perceptions via the Partner Modeling Questionnaire. The GenAI Voice Tutor primarily offered feedback on mistakes and next steps, but its correctness was limited (71.4% correct out of 416 feedback outputs). Quality issues were observed, particularly when the AI attempted to utter programming code elements. Students used the GenAI voice tutor primarily for debugging. They perceived it as competent, only somewhat human-like, and flexible. The present study is the first to explore the interaction dynamics of real-time voice GenAI tutors and novice programmers, informing future educational tool design and potentially addressing accessibility needs of diverse learners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for the 25th International Conference on Computing Education Research (Koli Calling '25)</p></details> |
| **[Prompt Programming: A Platform for Dialogue-based Computational Problem Solving with Generative AI Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04267v2)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computing students increasingly rely on generative AI tools for programming assistance, often without formal instruction or guidance. This highlights a need to teach students how to effectively interact with AI models, particularly through natural language prompts, to generate and critically evaluate code for solving computational tasks. To address this, we developed a novel platform for prompt programming that enables authentic dialogue-based interactions, supports problems involving multiple interdependent functions, and offers on-request execution of generated code. Data analysis from over 900 students in an introductory programming course revealed high engagement, with the majority of prompts occurring within multi-turn dialogues. Problems with multiple interdependent functions encouraged iterative refinement, with progression graphs highlighting several common strategies. Students were highly selective about the code they chose to test, suggesting that on-request execution of generated code promoted critical thinking. Given the growing importance of learning dialogue-based programming with AI, we provide this tool as a publicly accessible resource, accompanied by a corpus of programming problems for educational use.</p></details> | ITiCSE'25 paper |
| **[SLD-Spec: Enhancement LLM-assisted Specification Generation for Complex Loop Functions via Program Slicing and Logical Deletion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09917v1)** | 2025-09-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatically generating formal specifications from program code can greatly enhance the efficiency of program verification and enable end-to-end automation from requirements to reliable software. However, existing LLM-based approaches often struggle with programs that include complex loop structures, leading to irrelevant specifications. Moreover, the rigorous proof obligations and design constraints imposed by verification tools can further result in incomplete and ambiguous specifications. To address these challenges, we propose SLD-Spec, an LLM-assisted specification generation method tailored for programs with complex loop constructs. SLD-Spec introduces two novel phases into the traditional specification generation framework: (1) A slicing phase, which decomposes each function into code fragments containing independent loop structures, thereby reducing the complexity of specification generation; and (2) A logical deletion phase, which applies LLM-based reasoning to filter out incorrect candidate specifications--especially those not easily identified by verification tool--while retaining valid ones. Experimental results show that on the simple dataset, SLD-Spec successfully verifies five more programs than the state-of-the-art AutoSpec and reduces runtime by 23.73%. To address the limitations of existing research, we manually construct a dataset comprising four categories of complex loop programs. On this dataset, SLD-Spec significantly improves the correctness, relevance, and completeness of generated specifications compared to baseline methods, enabling 95.1% of assertions and 90.91% of programs to pass verification. Ablation studies further reveal that logical deletion is critical for enhancing specification correctness and relevance, while program slicing contributes significantly to specification completeness.

| **[On Integrating Large Language Models and Scenario-Based Programming for Improving Software Reliability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.09194v1)** | 2025-09-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are fast becoming indispensable tools for software developers, assisting or even partnering with them in crafting complex programs. The advantages are evident -- LLMs can significantly reduce development time, generate well-organized and comprehensible code, and occasionally suggest innovative ideas that developers might not conceive on their own. However, despite their strengths, LLMs will often introduce significant errors and present incorrect code with persuasive confidence, potentially misleading developers into accepting flawed solutions. In order to bring LLMs into the software development cycle in a more reliable manner, we propose a methodology for combining them with ``traditional'' software engineering techniques in a structured way, with the goal of streamlining the development process, reducing errors, and enabling users to verify crucial program properties with increased confidence. Specifically, we focus on the Scenario-Based Programming (SBP) paradigm -- an event-driven, scenario-based approach for software engineering -- to allow human developers to pour their expert knowledge into the LLM, as well as to inspect and verify its outputs. To evaluate our methodology, we conducted a significant case study, and used it to design and implement the Connect4 game. By combining LLMs and SBP we were able to create a highly-capable agent, which could defeat various strong existing agents. Further, in some cases, we were able to formally verify the correctness of our agent. Finally, our experience reveals interesting insights regarding the ease-of-use of our proposed approach. The full code of our case-study will be made publicly available with the final version of this paper.</p></details> |  |

While performance is critical, we also need to ensure that these optimizations are correct. In this paper, we focus on a specific class of optimizations, floating-point optimizations, notably due to fast math, at the LLVM IR level. We present a preliminary work, which leverages the Verified LLVM framework in the Rocq theorem prover, to prove the correctness of Fused-Multiply-Add (FMA) optimization for a basic block implementing the arithmetic expression $a * b + c$ . We then propose ways to extend this preliminary results by adding more program features and fast math floating-point optimizations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hiord#: An Approach to the Specification and Verification of Higher-Order (C)LP Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.17233v2)** | 2025-09-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Higher-order constructs enable more expressive and concise code by allowing procedures to be parameterized by other procedures. Assertions allow expressing partial program specifications, which can be verified either at compile time (statically) or run time (dynamically). In higher-order programs, assertions can also describe higher-order arguments. While in the context of (constraint) logic programming ((C)LP), run-time verification of higher-order assertions has received some attention, compile-time verification remains relatively unexplored. We propose a novel approach for statically verifying higher-order (C)LP programs with higher-order assertions. Although we use the Ciao assertion language for illustration, our approach is quite general and we believe is applicable to similar contexts. Higher-order arguments are described using predicate properties -- a special kind of property which exploits the (Ciao) assertion language. We refine the syntax and semantics of these properties and introduce an abstract criterion to determine conformance to a predicate property at compile time, based on a semantic order relation comparing the predicate property with the predicate assertions. We then show how to handle these properties using an abstract interpretation-based static analyzer for programs with first-order assertions by reducing predicate properties to first-order properties. Finally, we report on a prototype implementation and evaluate it through various examples within the Ciao system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)</p></details> |

Existing solutions often require additional context, expensive SMT solvers, or manual intervention to approximate these functions through symbolic stubs. In this work, we propose a novel approach to automatically generate symbolic stubs for external functions during symbolic execution that leverages Genetic Programming. When the symbolic executor encounters an external function, AutoStub generates training data by executing the function on randomly generated inputs and collecting the outputs. Genetic Programming then derives expressions that approximate the behavior of the function, serving as symbolic stubs. These automatically generated stubs allow the symbolic executor to continue the analysis without manual intervention, enabling the exploration of program paths that were previously intractable. We demonstrate that AutoStub can automatically approximate external functions with over 90% accuracy for 55% of the functions evaluated, and can infer language-specific behaviors that reveal edge cases crucial for software testing.</p></details> | 2025 HUMIES finalist |

However, the complexity of modeling languages, the large number of global constraints, and the art of creating good models have often hindered non-experts from choosing CP to solve their combinatorial problems. While generating an expert-level model from a natural-language description of a problem would be the dream, we are not yet there. We propose a tutoring system called CP-Model-Zoo, exploiting expert-written models accumulated through the years. CP-Model-Zoo retrieves the closest source code model from a database based on a user's natural language description of a combinatorial problem. It ensures that expert-validated models are presented to the user while eliminating the need for human data labeling. Our experiments show excellent accuracy in retrieving the correct model based on a user-input description of a problem simulated with different levels of expertise.</p></details> | <details><summary>prese...</summary><p>presented at"LLMs meet Constraint Solving" Workshop at CP2025 in Glasgow</p></details> |

As a computationally affordable method for resolving the extended problem, we present a revised version of the differential dynamic programming (DDP), termed the differential dynamic programming with ellipsoidal target set (ETS-DDP). To this end, the problem with an ellipsoidal target set is reformulated into an equivalent form with the orthogonal projection operator, yielding that the resulting cost functions turn out to be discontinuous at some points. As the DDP usually requires the differentiability of cost functions, in the ETS-DDP formulation we locally approximate the (nonsmooth) cost functions to smoothed ones near the path generated at the previous iteration, by utilizing the explicit form of the orthogonal projection operator. Moreover, a statistical inference method is also presented for designing the ellipsoidal target set, based on data on admissible target points collected by expert demonstrations. Via a simulation on autonomous parking of a vehicle, it is seen that the proposed ETS-DDP efficiently derives an admissible state trajectory while running much faster than the point-targeted DDP, at the expense of optimality.</p></details> | <details><summary>25th ...</summary><p>25th International Conference on Control, Automation and Systems (ICCAS)</p></details> |
| **[Aspect-Oriented Programming in Secure Software Development: A Case Study of Security Aspects in Web Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07449v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Security remains a critical challenge in modern web applications, where threats such as unauthorized access, data breaches, and injection attacks continue to undermine trust and reliability. Traditional Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) often intertwines security logic with business functionality, leading to code tangling, scattering, and reduced maintainability. This study investigates the role of Aspect-Oriented Programming (AOP) in enhancing secure software development by modularizing cross-cutting security concerns. Using a case study approach, we compare AOP-based implementations of security features including authentication, authorization, input validation, encryption, logging, and session management with conventional OOP or middleware-based approaches. Data collection involves analyzing code quality metrics (e.g., lines of code, coupling, cohesion, modularity index, reusability), performance metrics (response time, throughput, memory usage), and maintainability indicators. Developer feedback is also incorporated to assess integration and debugging experiences. Statistical methods, guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 software quality model, are applied to evaluate differences across implementations. The findings demonstrate that AOP enhances modularity, reusability, and maintainability of security mechanisms, while introducing only minimal performance overhead. The study contributes practical insights for software engineers and researchers seeking to balance security with software quality in web application development.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Reinforcement learning for online hyperparameter tuning in convex quadratic programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.07404v1)** | 2025-09-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quadratic programming is a workhorse of modern nonlinear optimization, control, and data science. Although regularized methods offer convergence guarantees under minimal assumptions on the problem data, they can exhibit the slow tail-convergence typical of first-order schemes, thus requiring many iterations to achieve high-accuracy solutions. Moreover, hyperparameter tuning significantly impacts on the solver performance but how to find an appropriate parameter configuration remains an elusive research question. To address these issues, we explore how data-driven approaches can accelerate the solution process. Aiming at high-accuracy solutions, we focus on a stabilized interior-point solver and carefully handle its two-loop flow and control parameters. We will show that reinforcement learning can make a significant contribution to facilitating the solver tuning and to speeding up the optimization process. Numerical experiments demonstrate that, after a lightweight training, the learned policy generalizes well to different problem classes with varying dimensions and to various solver configurations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Specification-Guided Repair of Arithmetic Errors in Dafny Programs using LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.03659v3)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Debugging and repairing faults when programs fail to formally verify can be complex and time-consuming. Automated Program Repair (APR) can ease this burden by automatically identifying and fixing faults. However, traditional APR techniques often rely on test suites for validation, but these may not capture all possible scenarios. In contrast, formal specifications provide strong correctness criteria, enabling more effective automated repair. In this paper, we present an APR tool for Dafny, a verification-aware programming language that uses formal specifications - including pre-conditions, post-conditions, and invariants - as oracles for fault localization and repair. Assuming the correctness of the specifications and focusing on arithmetic bugs, we localize faults through a series of steps, which include using Hoare logic to determine the state of each statement within the program, and applying Large Language Models (LLMs) to synthesize candidate fixes. The models considered are GPT-4o mini, Llama 3, Mistral 7B, and Llemma 7B. We evaluate our approach using DafnyBench, a benchmark of real-world Dafny programs. Our tool achieves 89.6% fault localization coverage and GPT-4o mini yields the highest repair success rate of 74.18%. These results highlight the potential of combining formal reasoning with LLM-based program synthesis for automated program repair.</p></details> |  |

Exploring and Evaluating the Design and Trade-offs of Proactive AI Programming Support](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18658v4)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI programming tools enable powerful code generation, and recent prototypes attempt to reduce user effort with proactive AI agents, but their impact on programming workflows remains unexplored. We introduce and evaluate Codellaborator, a design probe LLM agent that initiates programming assistance based on editor activities and task context. We explored three interface variants to assess trade-offs between increasingly salient AI support: prompt-only, proactive agent, and proactive agent with presence and context (Codellaborator). In a within-subject study (N=18), we find that proactive agents increase efficiency compared to prompt-only paradigm, but also incur workflow disruptions. However, presence indicators and interaction context support alleviated disruptions and improved users' awareness of AI processes. We underscore trade-offs of Codellaborator on user control, ownership, and code understanding, emphasizing the need to adapt proactivity to programming processes. Our research contributes to the design exploration and evaluation of proactive AI systems, presenting design implications on AI-integrated programming workflow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dato: A Task-Based Programming Model for Dataflow Accelerators](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06794v1)** | 2025-09-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent deep learning workloads increasingly push computational demand beyond what current memory systems can sustain, with many kernels stalling on data movement rather than computation. While modern dataflow accelerators incorporate on-chip streaming to mitigate off-chip bandwidth limitations, existing programming models struggle to harness these capabilities effectively. Low-level interfaces provide fine-grained control but impose significant development overhead, whereas high-level tile-based languages abstract away communication details, restricting optimization and forcing compilers to reconstruct the intended dataflow. We present Dato, a Python-embedded, task-based programming model for dataflow accelerators that elevates data communication and sharding to first-class type constructs. Developers write programs as a graph of tasks connected via explicit stream types, with sharded inputs specified using layout types. These tasks are first mapped virtually onto the accelerator's spatial fabric, and the compiler then generates a physical mapping that respects hardware constraints. Experimental results on both AMD Ryzen AI NPU and Alveo FPGA devices demonstrate that Dato achieves high performance while significantly reducing the burden of writing optimized code. On the NPU, Dato attains up to 84% hardware utilization for GEMM and delivers a 2.81x speedup on attention kernels compared to a state-of-the-art commercial framework. On the FPGA, Dato surpasses leading frameworks in performance when generating custom systolic arrays, achieving 98% of the theoretical peak performance.</p></details> |  |

This subarea of program analysis is challenging due to the existence of undecidable problems, and this Survey systematically explores approaches that mitigate this inherent difficulty. These include foundational decidability results, the use of ranking functions, and disjunctive well-founded transition invariants. The Survey also discusses non-termination witnesses, used to prove that a program will not halt. We examine the algorithmic and complexity aspects of these methods, showing how different approaches offer a trade-off between expressive power and computational complexity. The Survey does not discuss how termination analysis is performed on real-world programming languages, nor does it consider more expressive abstract models that include non-linear arithmetic, probabilistic choice, or term rewriting systems.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, we explore using Large Language Models (LLMs), and in particular, their abilities of doing in-context learning, for conversational code generation. As a first step, we define RATS, the ``Repetitive Assembly Task'', a 2D building task designed to lay the foundation for simulating industry assembly scenarios. In this task, a `programmer' instructs a cobot, using natural language, on how a certain assembly is to be built; that is, the programmer induces a program, through natural language. We create a dataset that pairs target structures with various example instructions (human-authored, template-based, and model-generated) and example code. With this, we systematically evaluate the capabilities of state-of-the-art LLMs for synthesising this kind of code, given in-context examples. Evaluating in a simulated environment, we find that LLMs are capable of generating accurate `first order code' (instruction sequences), but have problems producing `higher-order code' (abstractions such as functions, or use of loops).</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ITL4HRI workshop at RO-MAN 2025 conference</p></details> |

To address this, we intent to improve the multi-programming-lingual (MultiPL) performance of the base LLMs while retaining the most popular ones using restricted computational resources. We consider MultiPL to be a special case of multiple natural languages and propose a MultiPL extension of LLMs utilizing a hybrid mixture of experts (MoE), called MultiPL-MoE. Specifically, MultiPL-MoE combines two paired MoEs to optimize expert selection at both the token and segment levels. The token-level MoE is a standard upcycling MoE structure with a shared expert and a novel gate weight normalization approach that aids in the final fusion with the segment-level MoE. The segment-level MoE incorporates two innovative designs to better capture the syntactic structure and contextual patterns of programming languages: First, using a sliding window to partition the input token sequence into multiple segments; Then, adopting an expert-choice routing strategy that allows experts to select the top-k segments. The results of the experiment proved the effectiveness of MultiPL-MoE.</p></details> |  |
| **[What Challenges Do Developers Face When Using Verification-Aware Programming Languages?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23696v2)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software reliability is critical in ensuring that the digital systems we depend on function correctly. In software development, increasing software reliability often involves testing. However, for complex and critical systems, developers can use Design by Contract (DbC) methods to define precise specifications that software components must satisfy. Verification-Aware (VA) programming languages support DbC and formal verification at compile-time or run-time, offering stronger correctness guarantees than traditional testing. However, despite the strong guarantees provided by VA languages, their adoption remains limited. In this study, we investigate the barriers to adopting VA languages by analyzing developer discussions on public forums using topic modeling techniques. We complement this analysis with a developer survey to better understand the practical challenges associated with VA languages. Our findings reveal key obstacles to adoption, including steep learning curves and usability issues. Based on these insights, we identify actionable recommendations to improve the usability and accessibility of VA languages. Our findings suggest that simplifying tool interfaces, providing better educational materials, and improving integration with everyday development environments could improve the usability and adoption of these languages. Our work provides actionable insights for improving the usability of VA languages and making verification tools more accessible.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dynamic Programming Framework for Vehicular Task Offloading with Successive Action Improvement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05907v1)** | 2025-09-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, task offloading from vehicles with random velocities is optimized via a novel dynamic programming framework. Particularly, in a vehicular network with multiple vehicles and base stations (BSs), computing tasks of vehicles are offloaded via BSs to an edge server. Due to the random velocities, the exact locations of vehicles versus time, namely trajectories, cannot be determined in advance. Hence, instead of deterministic optimization, the cell association, uplink time, and throughput allocation of multiple vehicles during a period of task offloading are formulated as a finite-horizon Markov decision process. In order to derive a low-complexity solution algorithm, a two-time-scale framework is proposed. The scheduling period is divided into super slots, each super slot is further divided into a number of time slots. At the beginning of each super slot, we first obtain a reference scheduling scheme of cell association, uplink time and throughput allocation via deterministic optimization, yielding an approximation of the optimal value function. Within the super slot, the actual scheduling action of each time slot is determined by making improvement to the approximate value function according to the system state. Due to the successive improvement framework, a non-trivial average cost upper bound could be derived. In the simulation, the random trajectories of vehicles are generated from a high-fidelity traffic simulator. It is shown that the performance gain of the proposed scheduling framework over the baselines is significant.</p></details> |  |
| **[Programming tension in 3D printed networks inspired by spiderwebs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05855v1)** | 2025-09-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Each element in tensioned structural networks -- such as tensegrity, architectural fabrics, or medical braces/meshes -- requires a specific tension level to achieve and maintain the desired shape, stability, and compliance. These structures are challenging to manufacture, 3D print, or assemble because flattening the network during fabrication introduces multiplicative inaccuracies in the network's final tension gradients. This study overcomes this challenge by offering a fabrication algorithm for direct 3D printing of such networks with programmed tension gradients, an approach analogous to the spinning of spiderwebs. The algorithm: (i) defines the desired network and prescribes its tension gradients using the force density method; (ii) converts the network into an unstretched counterpart by numerically optimizing vertex locations toward target element lengths and converting straight elements into arcs to resolve any remaining error; and (iii) decomposes the network into printable toolpaths; Optional additional steps are: (iv) flattening curved 2D networks or 3D networks to ensure 3D printing compatibility; and (v) automatically resolving any unwanted crossings introduced by the flattening process. The proposed method is experimentally validated using 2D unit cells of viscoelastic filaments, where accurate tension gradients are achieved with an average element strain error of less than 1.0\%. The method remains effective for networks with element minimum length and maximum stress of 5.8 mm and 7.3 MPa, respectively. The method is used to demonstrate the fabrication of three complex cases: a flat spiderweb, a curved mesh, and a tensegrity system. The programmable tension gradient algorithm can be utilized to produce compact, integrated cable networks, enabling novel applications such as moment-exerting structures in medical braces and splints.</p></details> |  |

However, in tasks involving natural language and programming language (NL-PL) artifacts, relying solely on textual similarity is limited by their semantic gap. To this end, we conducted a large-scale empirical evaluation across various types of TLR tasks, revealing the limitations of textual similarity in NL-PL scenarios. To address these limitations, we propose an approach that incorporates multiple domain-specific auxiliary strategies, identified through empirical analysis, into two models: the Heterogeneous Graph Transformer (HGT) via edge types and the prompt-based Gemini 2.5 Pro via additional input information. We then evaluated our approach using the widely studied requirements-to-code TLR task, a representative case of NL-PL TLR. Experimental results show that both the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models outperformed their original counterparts without strategy integration. Furthermore, compared to the current state-of-the-art method HGNNLink, the multi-strategy HGT and Gemini 2.5 Pro models achieved average F1-score improvements of 3.68% and 8.84%, respectively, across twelve open-source projects, demonstrating the effectiveness of multi-strategy integration in enhancing overall model performance for the requirements-code TLR task.</p></details> | <details><summary>45 pa...</summary><p>45 pages, 5 images, 11 tables, Manuscript submitted to a Journal (2025)</p></details> |

Specifically, we develop an approximate maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimator using dynamic programming and tools from convex analysis. Our approach does not rely on restrictive noise assumptions and employs a Bellman-like update instead of a Bayesian update. Our proposed estimator is computationally efficient, with only modest overhead compared to a standard Kalman filter. Simulations demonstrate that our estimator achieves lower root mean squared error (RMSE) than the Kalman filter and has comparable performance to state-of-the-art estimators, while requiring significantly less computational power.</p></details> |  |

This sophistication motivates a shift toward simpler, more debuggable programming paradigm like Single Program Multiple Data (SPMD). However, SPMD in eager execution introduces two key challenges: ensuring consistency with single-device execution and achieving high performance at scale. In this paper, we introduce veScale, an eager-mode training system that fully embraces SPMD paradigm to democratize distributed tensor programming. veScale addresses the prevalent issue of inconsistent results in systems like PyTorch by introducing a novel algorithm of distributed Random Number Generation (RNG) compatible with arbitrary sharded operators. veScale also significantly boosts training performance by reducing PyTorch primitive's overhead and improving communication efficiency. Evaluations show that veScale delivers up to 2.2x speedup over the state-of-the-art training systems, like TorchTitan, and cuts code complexity by 78.4%, while preserving single-device-equivalent results.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 16 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

Several formula-based fault localization (FBFL) methods have been proposed, but they fail to guarantee a set of diagnoses across all failing tests or may produce redundant diagnoses that are not subset-minimal, particularly for programs with multiple faults. This paper introduces a novel fault localization approach for C programs with multiple faults. CFaults leverages Model-Based Diagnosis (MBD) with multiple observations and aggregates all failing test cases into a unified MaxSAT formula. Consequently, our method guarantees consistency across observations and simplifies the fault localization procedure. Experimental results on two benchmark sets of C programs, TCAS and C-Pack-IPAs, show that CFaults is faster than other FBFL approaches like BugAssist and SNIPER. Moreover, CFaults only generates subset-minimal diagnoses of faulty statements, whereas the other approaches tend to enumerate redundant diagnoses.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at FM 2024. 15 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables and 5 listings</p></details> |
| **[AgentArmor: Enforcing Program Analysis on Agent Runtime Trace to Defend Against Prompt Injection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.01249v2)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) agents offer a powerful new paradigm for solving various problems by combining natural language reasoning with the execution of external tools. However, their dynamic and non-transparent behavior introduces critical security risks, particularly in the presence of prompt injection attacks. In this work, we propose a novel insight that treats the agent runtime traces as structured programs with analyzable semantics. Thus, we present AgentArmor, a program analysis framework that converts agent traces into graph intermediate representation-based structured program dependency representations (e.g., CFG, DFG, and PDG) and enforces security policies via a type system. AgentArmor consists of three key components: (1) a graph constructor that reconstructs the agent's runtime traces as graph-based intermediate representations with control and data flow described within; (2) a property registry that attaches security-relevant metadata of interacted tools \& data, and (3) a type system that performs static inference and checking over the intermediate representation. By representing agent behavior as structured programs, AgentArmor enables program analysis for sensitive data flow, trust boundaries, and policy violations. We evaluate AgentArmor on the AgentDojo benchmark, the results show that AgentArmor can reduce the ASR to 3\%, with the utility drop only 1\%.</p></details> |  |

We study symbolic graphics programming, where the goal is to generate an SGP from a natural-language description. This task also serves as a lens into how LLMs understand the visual world by prompting them to generate images rendered from SGPs. Among various SGPs, our paper sticks to scalable vector graphics (SVGs). We begin by examining the extent to which LLMs can generate SGPs. To this end, we introduce SGP-GenBench, a comprehensive benchmark covering object fidelity, scene fidelity, and compositionality (attribute binding, spatial relations, numeracy). On SGP-GenBench, we discover that frontier proprietary models substantially outperform open-source models, and performance correlates well with general coding capabilities. Motivated by this gap, we aim to improve LLMs' ability to generate SGPs. We propose a reinforcement learning (RL) with verifiable rewards approach, where a format-validity gate ensures renderable SVG, and a cross-modal reward aligns text and the rendered image via strong vision encoders (e.g., SigLIP for text-image and DINO for image-image). Applied to Qwen-2.5-7B, our method substantially improves SVG generation quality and semantics, achieving performance on par with frontier systems. We further analyze training dynamics, showing that RL induces (i) finer decomposition of objects into controllable primitives and (ii) contextual details that improve scene coherence. Our results demonstrate that symbolic graphics programming offers a precise and interpretable lens on cross-modal grounding.</p></details> | <details><summary>Techn...</summary><p>Technical report (32 pages, 12 figures, project page: https://spherelab.ai/SGP-Gen/)</p></details> |
| **[Special Delivery: Programming with Mailbox Types (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2306.12935v3)** | 2025-09-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The asynchronous and unidirectional communication model supported by mailboxes is a key reason for the success of actor languages like Erlang and Elixir for implementing reliable and scalable distributed systems. While many actors may send messages to some actor, only the actor may receive from its mailbox. Although actors eliminate many of the issues stemming from shared memory concurrency, they remain vulnerable to communication errors such as protocol violations and deadlocks. Mailbox types are a novel behavioural type system for mailboxes first introduced for a process calculus by de'Liguoro and Padovani in 2018, which capture the contents of a mailbox as a commutative regular expression. Due to aliasing and nested evaluation contexts, moving from a process calculus to a programming language is challenging. This paper presents Pat, the first programming language design incorporating mailbox types, and describes an algorithmic type system. We make essential use of quasi-linear typing to tame some of the complexity introduced by aliasing. Our algorithmic type system is necessarily co-contextual, achieved through a novel use of backwards bidirectional typing, and we prove it sound and complete with respect to our declarative type system. We extend Pat with sums, products and higher-order functions, and also interfaces that allow finer-grained reasoning about mailbox contents. We implement a prototype type checker, and use it to demonstrate the expressiveness of Pat on a factory automation case study and a series of examples from the Savina actor benchmark suite.</p></details> | <details><summary>Revis...</summary><p>Revised and extended version of paper accepted to ICFP'23</p></details> |

As quantum computing advances, ensuring the reliability of quantum programs has become increasingly important. This paper introduces NovaQ, a diversity-guided testing framework for quantum programs. NovaQ combines a distribution-based test case generator with a novelty-driven evaluation module. The generator produces diverse quantum state inputs by mutating circuit parameters, while the evaluator quantifies behavioral novelty based on internal circuit state metrics, including magnitude, phase, and entanglement. By selecting inputs that map to infrequently covered regions in the metric space, NovaQ effectively explores under-tested program behaviors. We evaluate NovaQ on quantum programs of varying sizes and complexities. Experimental results show that NovaQ consistently achieves higher test input diversity and detects more bugs than existing baseline approaches.</p></details> | 5 pages |
| **[Taking GPU Programming Models to Task for Performance Portability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.08950v4)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Portability is critical to ensuring high productivity in developing and maintaining scientific software as the diversity in on-node hardware architectures increases. While several programming models provide portability for diverse GPU systems, they don't make any guarantees about performance portability. In this work, we explore several programming models -- CUDA, HIP, Kokkos, RAJA, OpenMP, OpenACC, and SYCL, to assess the consistency of their performance across NVIDIA and AMD GPUs. We use five proxy applications from different scientific domains, create implementations where missing, and use them to present a comprehensive comparative evaluation of the performance portability of these programming models. We provide a Spack scripting-based methodology to ensure reproducibility of experiments conducted in this work. Finally, we analyze the reasons for why some programming models underperform in certain scenarios and in some cases, present performance optimizations to the proxy applications.</p></details> | 16 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Assessing Large Language Models in Comprehending and Verifying Concurrent Programs across Memory Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.14326v2)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As concurrent programming becomes increasingly prevalent, effectively identifying and addressing concurrency issues such as data races and deadlocks is critical. This study evaluates the performance of several leading large language models (LLMs), including GPT-3.5-turbo, GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, and Mistral-AI's Large2, in understanding and analyzing concurrency issues within software programs. Given that relaxed memory models, such as Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO), are widely implemented and adapted in modern systems, supported even by commodity architectures like ARM and x86, our evaluation focuses not only on sequentially consistent memory models but also on these relaxed memory models. Specifically, we assess two main aspects: the models' capacity to detect concurrency problems under a sequentially consistent memory model and their ability to verify the correctness conditions of concurrent programs across both sequentially consistent and relaxed memory models. To do this, we leverage SV-COMP's pthread tests and 25 ARM Litmus tests designed to evaluate Total Store Order (TSO) and Partial Store Order (PSO) memory models. The experimental results reveal that GPT-4, GPT-4o, and Mistral-AI's Large2 demonstrate a robust understanding of concurrency issues, effectively identifying data races and deadlocks when assessed under a sequentially consistent memory model. However, despite its superior performance, all selected LLMs face significant challenges verifying program correctness under relaxed memory models. These LLMs exhibit limitations in accurately capturing memory ordering constraints, and their current capabilities fall short in verifying even small programs in these complex scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sensitivity analysis of an epidemic model with a mass vaccination program of a homogeneous population](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04188v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The COVID-19 pandemic forced the rapid development of vaccines and the implementation of mass vaccination programs around the world. However, many hesitated to take the vaccine due to concerns about its effectiveness. By looking at an ordinary differential equation (ODE) model of disease spread that incorporates a mass vaccination program, this study aims to determine the sensitivity of the cumulative count of infected individuals ($W$) and the cumulative death count ($D$) to the following model parameters: disease transmission rate ($\beta$), reciprocal of the disease latency period ($\kappa$), reciprocal of the infectious period ($\gamma$), death ratio ($\alpha$), vaccine efficacy rate ($r$), and vaccine rollout rate ($\delta$). This was implemented using Latin hypercube sampling and partial rank correlation coefficient. Results show that $D$ is highly sensitive to $\alpha$ and shows increasing sensitivity to $\delta$ in the long run. On the other hand, $W$ is highly sensitive to $\kappa$ at the beginning of the simulation, but this weakens over time. In contrast, $W$ is not very sensitive to $\delta$ initially but becomes very significant in the long run. This supports the importance of the vaccine rollout rate over the vaccine efficacy rate in curbing the spread of the disease in the population. It is also worthwhile to reduce the death ratio by developing a cure for the disease or improving the healthcare system as a whole.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, 15 figures, accepted for publication to SciEnggJ</p></details> |
| **[Adversarial Bug Reports as a Security Risk in Language Model-Based Automated Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05372v1)** | 2025-09-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM) - based Automated Program Repair (APR) systems are increasingly integrated into modern software development workflows, offering automated patches in response to natural language bug reports. However, this reliance on untrusted user input introduces a novel and underexplored attack surface. In this paper, we investigate the security risks posed by adversarial bug reports -- realistic-looking issue submissions crafted to mislead APR systems into producing insecure or harmful code changes. We develop a comprehensive threat model and conduct an empirical study to evaluate the vulnerability of state-of-the-art APR systems to such attacks. Our demonstration comprises 51 adversarial bug reports generated across a spectrum of strategies, from manual curation to fully automated pipelines. We test these against leading APR model and assess both pre-repair defenses (e.g., LlamaGuard variants, PromptGuard variants, Granite-Guardian, and custom LLM filters) and post-repair detectors (GitHub Copilot, CodeQL). Our findings show that current defenses are insufficient: 90\% of crafted bug reports triggered attacker-aligned patches. The best pre-repair filter blocked only 47\%, while post-repair analysis-often requiring human oversight-was effective in just 58\% of cases. To support scalable security testing, we introduce a prototype framework for automating the generation of adversarial bug reports. Our analysis exposes a structural asymmetry: generating adversarial inputs is inexpensive, while detecting or mitigating them remains costly and error-prone. We conclude with practical recommendations for improving the robustness of APR systems against adversarial misuse and highlight directions for future work on trustworthy automated repair.</p></details> |  |

With the rise of large language models (LLMs) in recent years, research in programming education has increasingly focused on automated feedback generation to help teachers provide timely support to every student. However, prior studies often overlook key pedagogical principles, such as mastery and progress adaptation, that shape effective feedback strategies. This paper introduces a novel pedagogical framework for LLM-driven feedback generation derived from established feedback models and local insights from secondary school teachers. To evaluate this framework, we implemented a web-based application for Python programming with LLM-based feedback that follows the framework and conducted a mixed-method evaluation with eight secondary-school computer science teachers. Our findings suggest that teachers consider that, when aligned with the framework, LLMs can effectively support students and even outperform human teachers in certain scenarios through instant and precise feedback. However, we also found several limitations, such as its inability to adapt feedback to dynamic classroom contexts. Such a limitation highlights the need to complement LLM-generated feedback with human expertise to ensure effective student learning. This work demonstrates an effective way to use LLMs for feedback while adhering to pedagogical standards and highlights important considerations for future systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>ECTEL...</summary><p>ECTEL 2025 Preprint.

| **[Parse Tree Tracking Through Time for Programming Process Analysis at Scale](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.03668v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background and Context: Programming process data can be utilized to understand the processes students use to write computer programming assignments. Keystroke- and line-level event logs have been used in the past in various ways, primarily in high-level descriptive statistics (e.g., timings, character deletion rate, etc). Analysis of behavior in context (e.g., how much time students spend working on loops) has been cumbersome because of our inability to automatically track high-level code representations, such as abstract syntax trees, through time and unparseable states. Objective: Our study has two goals. The first is to design the first algorithm that tracks parse tree nodes through time. Second, we utilize this algorithm to perform a partial replication study of prior work that used manual tracking of code representations, as well as other novel analyses of student programming behavior that can now be done at scale. Method: We use two algorithms presented in this paper to track parse tree nodes through time and construct tree representations for unparseable code states. We apply these algorithms to a public keystroke data from student coursework in a 2021 CS1 course and conduct analysis on the resulting parse trees. Findings: We discover newly observable statistics at scale, including that code is deleted at similar rates inside and outside of conditionals and loops, a third of commented out code is eventually restored, and that frequency with which students jump around in their code may not be indicative of struggle. Implications: The ability to track parse trees through time opens the door to understanding new dimensions of student programming, such as best practices of structural development of code over time, quantitative measurement of what syntactic constructs students struggle most with, refactoring behavior, and attention shifting within the code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Provably data-driven projection method for quadratic programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.04524v1)** | 2025-09-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Projection methods aim to reduce the dimensionality of the optimization instance, thereby improving the scalability of high-dimensional problems. Recently, Sakaue and Oki proposed a data-driven approach for linear programs (LPs), where the projection matrix is learned from observed problem instances drawn from an application-specific distribution of problems. We analyze the generalization guarantee for the data-driven projection matrix learning for convex quadratic programs (QPs). Unlike in LPs, the optimal solutions of convex QPs are not confined to the vertices of the feasible polyhedron, and this complicates the analysis of the optimal value function. To overcome this challenge, we demonstrate that the solutions of convex QPs can be localized within a feasible region corresponding to a special active set, utilizing Caratheodory's theorem. Building on such observation, we propose the unrolled active set method, which models the computation of the optimal value as a Goldberg-Jerrum (GJ) algorithm with bounded complexities, thereby establishing learning guarantees. We then further extend our analysis to other settings, including learning to match the optimal solution and input-aware setting, where we learn a mapping from QP problem instances to projection matrices.</p></details> | 25 pages |
