| **[SecRepoBench: Benchmarking Code Agents for Secure Code Completion in Real-World Repositories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21205v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper introduces SecRepoBench, a benchmark to evaluate code agents on secure code completion in real-world repositories. SecRepoBench has 318 code completion tasks in 27 C/C++ repositories, covering 15 CWEs. We evaluate 28 standalone LLMs and 13 code agents across 3 state-of-the-art agent frameworks using our benchmark. We find that state-of-the-art LLMs struggle with generating correct and secure code completions. However, code agents significantly outperform standalone LLMs. We show that SecRepoBench is more difficult than the prior state-of-the-art benchmark. Finally, our comprehensive analysis provides insights into potential directions for enhancing the ability of code agents to write correct and secure code in real-world repositories.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Computability of Finding Capacity-Achieving Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01414v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work studies the problem of constructing capacity-achieving codes from an algorithmic perspective. Specifically, we prove that there exists a Turing machine which, given a discrete memoryless channel $p_{Y|X}$, a target rate $R$ less than the channel capacity $C(p_{Y|X})$, and an error tolerance $\epsilon > 0$, outputs a block code $\mathcal{C}$ achieving a rate at least $R$ and a maximum block error probability below $\epsilon$. The machine operates in the general case where all transition probabilities of $p_{Y|X}$ are computable real numbers, and the parameters $R$ and $\epsilon$ are rational. The proof builds on Shannon's channel coding theorem and relies on an exhaustive search approach that systematically enumerates all codes of increasing block length until a valid code is found. This construction is formalized using the theory of recursive functions, yielding a $\mu$-recursive function $\mathrm{FindCode} : \mathbb{N}^3 \rightharpoonup \mathbb{N}$ that takes as input appropriate encodings of $p_{Y|X}$, $R$, and $\epsilon$, and, whenever $R < C(p_{Y|X})$, outputs an encoding of a valid code. By Kleene's normal form theorem, which establishes the computational equivalence between Turing machines and $\mu$-recursive functions, we conclude that the problem is solvable by a Turing machine. This result can also be extended to the case where $\epsilon$ is a computable real number, while we further discuss an analogous generalization of our analysis when $R$ is computable as well. We note that the assumptions that the probabilities of $p_{Y|X}$, as well as $\epsilon$ and $R$, are computable real numbers cannot be further weakened, since computable reals constitute the largest subset of $\mathbb{R}$ representable by algorithmic means.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uncovering Code Insights: Leveraging GitHub Artifacts for Deeper Code Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03549v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding the purpose of source code is a critical task in software maintenance, onboarding, and modernization. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating code explanations, they often lack grounding in the broader software engineering context. We propose a novel approach that leverages natural language artifacts from GitHub -- such as pull request descriptions, issue descriptions and discussions, and commit messages -- to enhance LLM-based code understanding. Our system consists of three components: one that extracts and structures relevant GitHub context, another that uses this context to generate high-level explanations of the code's purpose, and a third that validates the explanation. We implemented this as a standalone tool, as well as a server within the Model Context Protocol (MCP), enabling integration with other AI-assisted development tools. Our main use case is that of enhancing a standard LLM-based code explanation with code insights that our system generates. To evaluate explanations' quality, we conducted a small scale user study, with developers of several open projects, as well as developers of proprietary projects. Our user study indicates that when insights are generated they often are helpful and non trivial, and are free from hallucinations.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 6 figures, to be published in AISM 2025, see https://aism25.github.io/aism25/</p></details> |
| **[Towards Realistic Project-Level Code Generation via Multi-Agent Collaboration and Semantic Architecture Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03404v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in automated code generation. In real-world software engineering, the growing demand for rapid iteration and continuous delivery underscores the importance of project-level code generation, where LLMs are expected to generate complete software projects directly from complex user requirements. Although existing studies have made initial explorations, they still face key limitations, including unrealistic datasets and unreliable evaluation metrics that fail to reflect real-world complexity, the semantic gap between human-written requirements and machine-interpretable structures, and difficulties in managing hierarchical dependencies and maintaining quality throughout the generation process. To address these limitations, we first introduce CodeProjectEval, a project-level code generation dataset built from 18 real-world repositories with 12.7 files and 2,388.6 lines of code per task on average, supplemented with documentation and executable test cases for automatic evaluation. We further propose ProjectGen, a multi-agent framework that decomposes projects into architecture design, skeleton generation, and code filling stages with iterative refinement and memory-based context management. Within this framework, we introduce the Semantic Software Architecture Tree (SSAT), a structured and semantically rich representation that effectively bridges user requirements and source code implementation. Experiments show that ProjectGen achieves state-of-the-art performance, passing 52/124 test cases on the small-scale project-level code generation dataset DevBench, a 57% improvement over the baseline approaches, and 310 test cases on CodeProjectEval, representing an improvement of roughly tenfold compared to the baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[The (+)-(L, P)-TGRS code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03398v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The construction of the non-Reed-Solomon (in short, non-RS) type linear code has been one of the research hotspots in recent years. In 2025, Hu et al. constructed some non-RS MDS codes by defining the (L, P)-twisted generalized Reed-Solomon code (in short, (L, P)-TGRS). In this paper, we focus on the (+)-(L, P)-TGRS code C. We firstly present a parity-check matrix. Secondly, we give a sufficient and necessary condition for C to be NMDS which partially answers two open problems proposed by Hu et al. in 2025, and prove that C is non-RS for 2k > n which partially improves the corresponding result given by Hu et al. in 2025,. Thirdly, we give a sufficient condition for C not to be self-dual or self-orthogonal, respectively, furthermore, we construct two classes of self-orthogonal codes which is a promotion of the corresponding result given by Ding et al. in 2025. Finally, some examples are given.</p></details> | 23pages |
| **[Distilling LLM Agent into Small Models with Retrieval and Code Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17612v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at complex reasoning tasks but remain computationally expensive, limiting their practical deployment. To address this, recent works have focused on distilling reasoning capabilities into smaller language models (sLMs) using chain-of-thought (CoT) traces from teacher LLMs. However, this approach struggles in scenarios requiring rare factual knowledge or precise computation, where sLMs often hallucinate due to limited capability. In this work, we propose Agent Distillation, a framework for transferring not only reasoning capability but full task-solving behavior from LLM-based agents into sLMs with retrieval and code tools. We improve agent distillation along two complementary axes: (1) we introduce a prompting method called first-thought prefix to enhance the quality of teacher-generated trajectories; and (2) we propose a self-consistent action generation for improving test-time robustness of small agents. We evaluate our method on eight reasoning tasks across factual and mathematical domains, covering both in-domain and out-of-domain generalization. Our results show that sLMs as small as 0.5B, 1.5B, 3B parameters can achieve performance competitive with next-tier larger 1.5B, 3B, 7B models fine-tuned using CoT distillation, demonstrating the potential of agent distillation for building practical, tool-using small agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/Nardien/agent-distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |

They contain many constacyclic codes with optimal, or almost-optimal, or best-known parameters. We also consider various forms of the length $n$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Robustness of Model Editing in Code LLMs: An Empirical Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03182v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used in software development. However, while LLMs remain static after pretraining, programming languages and APIs continue to evolve, leading to the generation of deprecated or incompatible code that undermines reliability. Retraining LLMs from scratch to reflect such changes is computationally expensive, making model editing a promising lightweight alternative that updates only a small subset of parameters. Despite its potential, it remains unclear whether model editing yields genuine syntactic and semantic adaptations or merely superficial fixes. In this work, we present a systematic study of five state-of-the-art model editing methods: Constrained Fine-Tuning (FT), GRACE, MEMIT, PMET, and ROME. We apply these methods to three leading open-source code LLMs, CodeLlama, CodeQwen1.5, and DeepSeek-Coder, under controlled API deprecation scenarios. Our evaluation covers both instant and sequential editing settings, using three disjoint evaluation sets designed to assess reliability, generalization, and specificity. We measure model correctness at three levels: successful compilation, partial test case pass, and full test pass. Our findings show that instant edits consistently degrade model performance, with syntactic validity dropping by up to 86 percentage points and functional correctness declining by 45 points even in the best-performing setting. Sequential edits further amplify this degradation, and in some cases, model performance collapses entirely. Across all models, most passing generations relied on workarounds rather than correctly adopting the intended changes, while faulty adoptions that result in test failures or compilation errors were significantly more frequent. Correct adoptions, where the model correctly integrates the intended change, occurred in only about 6% of cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 2 figures, 15 tables</p></details> |
| **[Leveraging LLMs to Automate Energy-Aware Refactoring of Parallel Scientific Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.02184v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used for generating parallel scientific codes, most efforts emphasize functional correctness, often overlooking performance, especially energy efficiency. We propose LASSI-EE, an automated LLM-based refactoring framework that generates energy-efficient parallel codes through a multi-stage, iterative approach integrating runtime power profiling, energy-aware prompting, self-correcting feedback loops, and an LLM-as-a-Judge agent for automated screening of code solutions. We introduce energy-reduction@k, a novel metric that quantifies expected energy reduction when generating k code candidates and selecting the most energy-efficient, enabling systematic evaluation of multi-attempt generation strategies. Evaluating 20 HeCBench applications and two miniApps on NVIDIA A100 and AMD MI100 GPUs, a single run (k=1) with LASSI-EE delivers refactored parallel codes with an average 29% expected energy reduction at an 81% pass rate, representing a 2.8x improvement over vanilla LLM prompting. Multiple runs (k=3) achieve an average 48% expected energy reduction at a 97% pass rate. These results are consistent across devices, demonstrating LASSI-EE's effectiveness across diverse hardware architectures.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 4 figures, version under review at a peer-reviewed conference</p></details> |
| **[Data Dependency-Aware Code Generation from Enhanced UML Sequence Diagrams](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.03379v3)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at generating code from natural language (NL) descriptions. However, the plain textual descriptions are inherently ambiguous and often fail to capture complex requirements like intricate system behaviors, conditional logic, and architectural constraints; implicit data dependencies in service-oriented architectures are difficult to infer and handle correctly. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel step-by-step code generation framework named UML2Dep by leveraging unambiguous formal specifications of complex requirements. First, we introduce an enhanced Unified Modeling Language (UML) sequence diagram tailored for service-oriented architectures. This diagram extends traditional visual syntax by integrating decision tables and API specifications, explicitly formalizing structural relationships and business logic flows in service interactions to rigorously eliminate linguistic ambiguity. Second, recognizing the critical role of data flow, we introduce a dedicated data dependency inference (DDI) task. DDI systematically constructs an explicit data dependency graph prior to actual code synthesis. To ensure reliability, we formalize DDI as a constrained mathematical reasoning task through novel prompting strategies, aligning with LLMs' excellent mathematical strengths. Additional static parsing and dependency pruning further reduce context complexity and cognitive load associated with intricate specifications, thereby enhancing reasoning accuracy and efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Prompt Generation for Code Intelligence: An Empirical study and Experience in WeChat](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03136v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Code Models (LCMs) show potential in code intelligence, but their effectiveness is greatly influenced by prompt quality. Current prompt design is mostly manual, which is time-consuming and highly dependent on specific LCMs and tasks. While automated prompt generation (APG) exists in NLP, it is underexplored for code intelligence. This creates a gap, as automating the prompt process is essential for developers facing diverse tasks and black-box LCMs. To mitigate this, we empirically investigate two important parts of APG: Instruction Generation (IG) and Multi-Step Reasoning (MSR). IG provides a task-related description to instruct LCMs, while MSR guides them to produce logical steps before the final answer. We evaluate widely-used APG methods for each part on four open-source LCMs and three code intelligence tasks: code translation (PL-PL), code summarization (PL-NL), and API recommendation (NL-PL).Experimental results indicate that both IG and MSR dramatically enhance performance compared to basic prompts. Based on these results, we propose a novel APG approach combining the best methods of the two parts. Experiments show our approach achieves average improvements of 28.38% in CodeBLEU (code translation), 58.11% in ROUGE-L (code summarization), and 84.53% in SuccessRate@1 (API recommendation) over basic prompts. To validate its effectiveness in an industrial scenario, we evaluate our approach on WeChat-Bench, a proprietary dataset, achieving an average MRR improvement of 148.89% for API recommendation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ASE 2025 Industry Track</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Synthetic Benchmarks: Evaluating LLM Performance on Real-World Class-Level Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26130v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong performance on function-level code generation benchmarks, yet real-world software development increasingly demands class-level implementations that integrate multiple methods, attributes, and dependencies within authentic project contexts. This gap between benchmark performance and practical utility raises critical questions about LLMs' readiness for production code assistance, particularly regarding their ability to generalize across familiar and novel codebases. We introduce a benchmark derived from real-world open-source repositories, comprising classes divided into seen and unseen partitions to evaluate generalization under practical conditions. We systematically examine how input specification completeness and retrieval-augmented generation affect class-level correctness across multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our evaluation reveals a substantial performance gap: while LLMs achieve 84 to 89% correctness on synthetic benchmarks, they attain only 25 to 34% on real-world class tasks, with minimal distinction between familiar and novel codebases. Comprehensive documentation provides marginal improvements (1 to 3%), whereas retrieval augmentation yields greater gains (4 to 7%) by supplying concrete implementation patterns. Error analysis identifies AttributeError, TypeError, and AssertionError as dominant failure modes, with distinct patterns between synthetic and real-world scenarios. These findings provide actionable insights for enhancing context modelling, documentation strategies, and retrieval integration in production code assistance tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-p...</summary><p>Pre-print submitted for reviwer to TOSEM</p></details> |
| **[List Decoding and New Bicycle Code Constructions for Quantum LDPC Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02951v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a new decoder, called the Multiple-Bases Belief-Propagation List Decoder (MBBP-LD), for Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (QLDPC) codes. It extends the Multiple-Bases Belief-Propagation (MBBP) framework, originally developed for classical cyclic LDPC codes. The proposed method preserves the linear-time complexity of standard BP decoder while improving the logical error rate. To further reduce the logical error rate, a new decision rule is introduced for the post-processing list decoder, outperforming the conventional least-metric selector (LMS) criterion. For the recently developed and implemented bivariate bicycle (BB) code with parameters \([[144,12,12]]\), our proposed MBBP-LD decoder achieves up to 40\% lower logical error rate compared to the state-of-the-art decoder for short QLDPC codes, i.e., BP with ordered-statistics decoding (BP-OSD), while retaining the linear-time complexity of the plain BP decoder. In addition, we explore a new subclass of BB codes, that we refer to as the univariate bicycle (UB) codes, specifically with lower-weight parity checks (\(w=6,8\)). This reduces the polynomial search space for the code compared to general BB codes, i.e., by reducing the search space over two polynomial components in BB codes to just a single polynomial component in UB codes. Simulations demonstrate the promising performance of these codes under various types of BP decoders.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Code Changes to Quality Gains: An Empirical Study in Python ML Systems with PyQu](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02827v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In an era shaped by Generative Artificial Intelligence for code generation and the rising adoption of Python-based Machine Learning systems (MLS), software quality has emerged as a major concern. As these systems grow in complexity and importance, a key obstacle lies in understanding exactly how specific code changes affect overall quality-a shortfall aggravated by the lack of quality assessment tools and a clear mapping between ML systems code changes and their quality effects. Although prior work has explored code changes in MLS, it mostly stops at what the changes are, leaving a gap in our knowledge of the relationship between code changes and the MLS quality. To address this gap, we conducted a large-scale empirical study of 3,340 open-source Python ML projects, encompassing more than 3.7 million commits and 2.7 trillion lines of code. We introduce PyQu, a novel tool that leverages low level software metrics to identify quality-enhancing commits with an average accuracy, precision, and recall of 0.84 and 0.85 of average F1 score. Using PyQu and a thematic analysis, we identified 61 code changes, each demonstrating a direct impact on enhancing software quality, and we classified them into 13 categories based on contextual characteristics. 41% of the changes are newly discovered by our study and have not been identified by state-of-the-art Python changes detection tools. Our work offers a vital foundation for researchers, practitioners, educators, and tool developers, advancing the quest for automated quality assessment and best practices in Python-based ML software.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the proceedings of IEEE/ACM 48th International Conference on Software Engineering</p></details> |
| **[A Construction of Infinite Families of Self-Orthogonal Quasi-Cyclic Codes Using Constituent Codes.pdf](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02813v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quasi-cyclic codes have been recently employed in the constructions of quantum error-correcting codes. In this paper, we propose a construction of infinite families of quasi-cyclic codes which are self-orthogonal with respect to the Euclidean and Hermitian inner products. In particular, their dimension and a lower bound for their minimum distance are computed using their constituent codes defined over field extensions of $\mathbb{F}_q$. We also show that the lower bound for the minimum distance satisfies the square-root-like lower bound and also show how self-dual quasi-cyclic codes can arise from our construction. Using the CSS construction, we show the existence of quantum error-correcting codes with good parameters.</p></details> | 20 pages |
| **[Optimal Source Coding of Markov Chains for Real-Time Remote Estimation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02803v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We revisit the source coding problem for a Markov chain under the assumption that the transmission times and how fast the Markov chain transitions its state happen at the same time-scale. Specifically, we assume that the transmission of each bit takes a single time slot, and the Markov chain updates its state in the same time slot. Thus, the length of the codeword assigned to a symbol determines the number of non-transmitted symbols, as well as, the probability of the realization of the next symbol to be transmitted. We aim to minimize the average transmission duration over an infinite horizon by proposing an optimal source coding policy based on the last transmitted symbol and its transmission duration. To find the optimal policy, we formulate the problem with a Markov decision process (MDP) by augmenting the symbols alongside the transmission duration of the symbols. Finally, we analyze two Huffman-based benchmark policies and compare their performances with the proposed optimal policy. We observe that, in randomly generated processes, our proposed optimal policy decreases the average transmission duration compared to benchmark policies. The performance gain varies based on the parameters of the Markov process.</p></details> |  |
| **[VCode: a Multimodal Coding Benchmark with SVG as Symbolic Visual Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02778v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code has emerged as a precise and executable medium for reasoning and action in the agent era. Yet, progress has largely focused on language-centric tasks such as program synthesis and debugging, leaving visual-centric coding underexplored. Inspired by how humans reason over sketches, we advocate SVG code as a compact, interpretable, and executable visual representation. We introduce VCode, a benchmark that reframes multimodal understanding as code generation: given an image, a model must produce SVG that preserves symbolic meaning for downstream reasoning. VCode covers three domains - general commonsense (MM-Vet), professional disciplines (MMMU), and visual-centric perception (CV-Bench). To assess symbolic fidelity, we propose CodeVQA, a novel evaluation protocol in which a policy model answers questions over rendered SVGs; correct answers indicate faithful symbolic preservation. Empirically, frontier VLMs struggle to generate faithful SVGs, revealing a persistent gap between language-centric and visual-centric coding. To close this gap, we introduce VCoder, an agentic framework that augments VLMs along two axes: (i) Thinking with Revision, which iteratively analyzes discrepancies and refines SVG code; and (ii) Acting with Visual Tools, where detectors and parsers supply structured cues such as objects, shapes, and text beyond the model's intrinsic capacity. Across benchmarks, frontier VLMs with strong reasoning capabilities score well overall yet remain limited in professional knowledge and 3D reasoning. VCoder delivers a 12.3-point overall gain over the top-performing Claude-4-Opus. Human studies show that both humans and VLMs perform worse on rendered SVGs, their consistency reveals the promise of symbolic visual representation. The benchmark and code are available at https://github.com/CSU-JPG/VCode.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project page: https://csu-jpg.github.io/VCode Github: https://github.com/CSU-JPG/VCode</p></details> |
| **[Relaxed vs. Full Local Decodability with Few Queries: Equivalence and Separations for Linear Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02633v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A locally decodable code (LDC) $C \colon \{0,1\}^k \to \{0,1\}^n$ is an error-correcting code that allows one to recover any bit of the original message with good probability while only reading a small number of bits from a corrupted codeword. A relaxed locally decodable code (RLDC) is a weaker notion where the decoder is additionally allowed to abort and output a special symbol $\bot$ if it detects an error. For a large constant number of queries $q$, there is a large gap between the blocklength $n$ of the best $q$-query LDC and the best $q$-query RLDC. Existing constructions of RLDCs achieve polynomial length $n = k^{1 + O(1/q)}$, while the best-known $q$-LDCs only achieve subexponential length $n = 2^{k^{o(1)}}$. On the other hand, for $q = 2$, it is known that RLDCs and LDCs are equivalent. We thus ask the question: what is the smallest $q$ such that there exists a $q$-RLDC that is not a $q$-LDC? In this work, we show that any linear $3$-query RLDC is in fact a $3$-LDC, i.e., linear RLDCs and LDCs are equivalent at $3$ queries. More generally, we show for any constant $q$, there is a soundness error threshold $s(q)$ such that any linear $q$-RLDC with soundness error below this threshold must be a $q$-LDC. This implies that linear RLDCs cannot have "strong soundness" -- a stricter condition satisfied by linear LDCs that says the soundness error is proportional to the fraction of errors in the corrupted codeword -- unless they are simply LDCs. In addition, we give simple constructions of linear $15$-query RLDCs that are not $q$-LDCs for any constant $q$, showing that for $q = 15$, linear RLDCs and LDCs are not equivalent. We also prove nearly identical results for locally correctable codes and their corresponding relaxed counterpart.</p></details> |  |
| **[Lost in Code Generation: Reimagining the Role of Software Models in AI-driven Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02475v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI enables rapid ``vibe coding," where natural language prompts yield working software systems. While this lowers barriers to software creation, it also collapses the boundary between prototypes and engineered software, leading to fragile systems that lack robustness, security, and maintainability. We argue that this shift motivates a reimagining of software models. Rather than serving only as upfront blueprints, models can be recovered post-hoc from AI-generated code to restore comprehension, expose risks, and guide refinement. In this role, models serve as mediators between human intent, AI generation, and long-term system evolution, providing a path toward sustainable AI-driven software engineering.</p></details> |  |

However, its adoption is hindered by the complexity of policy languages and the risk of misconfigurations. In this work, we present ARPaCCino, an agentic system that combines Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented-Generation (RAG), and tool-based validation to automate the generation and verification of PaC rules. Given natural language descriptions of the desired policies, ARPaCCino generates formal Rego rules, assesses IaC compliance, and iteratively refines the IaC configurations to ensure conformance. Thanks to its modular agentic architecture and integration with external tools and knowledge bases, ARPaCCino supports policy validation across a wide range of technologies, including niche or emerging IaC frameworks. Experimental evaluation involving a Terraform-based case study demonstrates ARPaCCino's effectiveness in generating syntactically and semantically correct policies, identifying non-compliant infrastructures, and applying corrective modifications, even when using smaller, open-weight LLMs. Our results highlight the potential of agentic RAG architectures to enhance the automation, reliability, and accessibility of PaC workflows.</p></details> |  |

However, current research provides limited coverage of complex chart scenarios and computation-intensive reasoning tasks prevalent in real-world applications. This study proposes an automated multi-stage code-driven pipeline for systematically generating visual reasoning datasets to address these limitations. The pipeline integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) to retrieve professional chart templates and employs chain-of-thought (CoT) strategies to generate reasoning codes that simulate real data distributions, thereby driving chart rendering and question-related statistical computations. Through model-based evaluation, the pipeline enhances chart diversity and data quality. Using this framework, we construct ChartM$^3$, a multi-dimensional and multi-step dataset containing 38K charts and 142K Q&A pairs for training, along with 2,871 high-quality evaluation samples for enabling practical performance assessment. Supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) experiments demonstrate that our dataset significantly improves reasoning capabilities and cross-domain generalization performance, enabling smaller models to achieve performance comparable to larger-scale models in complex chart comprehension.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages, EMNLP25 Accepted</p></details> |

The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules. Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset.

| **[Real-Time Neural Video Compression with Unified Intra and Inter Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14431v4)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent years, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior compression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding capabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations, including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled, disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding, where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an average of 12.1% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and models will be released.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[Open the Oyster: Empirical Evaluation and Improvement of Code Reasoning Confidence in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02197v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the widespread application of large language models (LLMs) in the field of code intelligence, increasing attention has been paid to the reliability and controllability of their outputs in code reasoning tasks. Confidence estimation serves as an effective and convenient approach for evaluating these aspects. This paper proposes a confidence analysis and enhancement framework for LLMs tailored to code reasoning tasks. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study on the confidence reliability of mainstream LLMs across different tasks, and further evaluate the effectiveness of techniques such as prompt strategy optimisation and mathematical calibration (e.g., Platt Scaling) in improving confidence reliability. Our results show that DeepSeek-Reasoner achieves the best performance across various tasks, outperforming other models by up to $0.680$, $0.636$, and $13.652$ in terms of ECE, Brier Score, and Performance Score, respectively. The hybrid strategy combining the reassess prompt strategy and Platt Scaling achieves improvements of up to $0.541$, $0.628$, and $15.084$ over the original performance in the aforementioned three metrics. These results indicate that models with reasoning capabilities demonstrate superior confidence reliability, and that the hybrid strategy is the most effective in enhancing the confidence reliability of various models. Meanwhile, we elucidate the impact of different task complexities, model scales, and strategies on confidence performance, and highlight that the confidence of current LLMs in complex reasoning tasks still has considerable room for improvement. This study not only provides a research foundation and technical reference for the application of confidence in LLM-assisted software engineering, but also points the way for future optimisation and engineering deployment of confidence mechanisms.</p></details> | 13 pages, 4 figures |

Full fine-tuning and Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of Code Language Models (Code-LMs) has been explored for multilingual knowledge transfer. AdapterFusion is a PEFT architecture that aims to enhance task performance by leveraging information from multiple programming languages, but primarily focuses on the target programming language. In our previous work, we proposed AdvFusion, a novel PEFT-based approach that effectively learns from other programming languages before adapting to the target task. Though previous experiments showed that AdvFusion outperformed AdapterFusion and LoRA, it was applied on pre-trained Code-LMs and was limited to only two tasks, code summarization and method name prediction. In this study, we expanded our work and investigated AdvFusion on Code Large Language Models (Code-LLMs), considering three new tasks: code generation, code translation, and commit message generation. We observed that different Code-LLMs/tasks exhibit different characteristics. In code generation, AdvFusion outperformed AdapterFusion but not other PEFT methods (LoRA, Compacter, and TaskAdapter). In commit message generation, AdapterFusion performed better than AdvFusion, and contrary to code generation, we found that the other PEFT methods do not have better performance. In code translation, AdvFusion performed worse than AdapterFusion overall, with the performance gap marginally widening as the model size increases. However, consistent with code generation, other PEFT methods showed better performance.</p></details> |  |

Chat-based and inline-coding-based GenAI has already had substantial impact on the CS Education community. The recent introduction of ``vibe coding'' may further transform how students program, as it introduces a new way for students to create software projects with minimal oversight. Objectives. The purpose of this study is to understand how students in introductory programming and advanced software engineering classes interact with a vibe coding platform (Replit) when creating software and how the interactions differ by programming background. Methods. Interview participants were asked to think-aloud while building a web application using Replit. Thematic analysis was then used to analyze the video recordings with an emphasis on the interactions between the student and Replit. Findings. For both groups, the majority of student interactions with Replit were to test or debug the prototype and only rarely did students visit code. Prompts by advanced software engineering students were much more likely to include relevant app feature and codebase contexts than those by introductory programming students.</p></details> |  |

Textures of clouds and waves, the growth of cities and forests, or the formation of materials and landscapes are all examples of patterns emerging from underlying mechanisms. We present the Scitextures dataset, a large-scale collection of textures and visual patterns from all domains of science, tech, and art, along with the models and code that generate these images. Covering over 1,200 different models and 100,000 images of patterns and textures from physics, chemistry, biology, sociology, technology, mathematics, and art, this dataset offers a way to explore the connection between the visual patterns that shape our world and the mechanisms that produce them. Created by an agentic AI pipeline that autonomously collects and implements models in standardized form, we use SciTextures to evaluate the ability of leading AI models to link visual patterns to the models and code that generate them, and to identify different patterns that emerged from the same process. We also test AIs ability to infer and recreate the mechanisms behind visual patterns by providing a natural image of a real-world pattern and asking the AI to identify, model, and code the mechanism that formed the pattern, then run this code to generate a simulated image that is compared to the real image. These benchmarks show that vision-language models (VLMs) can understand and simulate the physical system beyond a visual pattern.

| **[KV Cache Transform Coding for Compact Storage in LLM Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01815v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Serving large language models (LLMs) at scale necessitates efficient key-value (KV) cache management. KV caches can be reused across conversation turns via shared-prefix prompts that are common in iterative code editing and chat. However, stale caches consume scarce GPU memory, require offloading, or force recomputation. We present KVTC, a lightweight transform coder that compresses KV caches for compact on-GPU and off-GPU storage. Drawing on classical media compression, KVTC combines PCA-based feature decorrelation, adaptive quantization, and entropy coding. It requires only a brief initial calibration and leaves model parameters unchanged. By exploiting redundancies in KV caches, KVTC achieves up to 20$\times$ compression while maintaining reasoning and long-context accuracy, and 40$\times$ or higher for specific use cases. We test KVTC with Llama 3, Mistral NeMo, and R1-Qwen 2.5 models across benchmarks including AIME25, LiveCodeBench, GSM8K, MMLU, Qasper, RULER, and MATH-500. It consistently outperforms inference-time baselines such as token eviction, quantization, and SVD-based methods, while achieving higher compression ratios. These results support KVTC as a practical building block for memory-efficient LLM serving with reusable KV caches.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyperNQ: A Hypergraph Neural Network Decoder for Quantum LDPC Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01741v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing requires effective error correction strategies to mitigate noise and decoherence. Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check (QLDPC) codes have emerged as a promising solution for scalable Quantum Error Correction (QEC) applications by supporting constant-rate encoding and a sparse parity-check structure. However, decoding QLDPC codes via traditional approaches such as Belief Propagation (BP) suffers from poor convergence in the presence of short cycles. Machine learning techniques like Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) utilize learned message passing over their node features; however, they are restricted to pairwise interactions on Tanner graphs, which limits their ability to capture higher-order correlations. In this work, we propose HyperNQ, the first Hypergraph Neural Network (HGNN)- based QLDPC decoder that captures higher-order stabilizer constraints by utilizing hyperedges-thus enabling highly expressive and compact decoding. We use a two-stage message passing scheme and evaluate the decoder over the pseudo-threshold region. Below the pseudo-threshold mark, HyperNQ improves the Logical Error Rate (LER) up to 84% over BP and 50% over GNN-based strategies, demonstrating enhanced performance over the existing state-of-the-art decoders.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 4 figures, Submitted to the IEEE International Conference on Communications (ICC 2026).

| **[A Hypergraph based lower bound on Pliable Index Coding based on Nested Side-Information Sets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01539v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In pliable index coding (PICOD), a number of clients are connected via a noise-free broadcast channel to a server which has a list of messages. Each client has a unique subset of messages at the server as side-information, and requests for any one message not in the side-information. A PICOD scheme of length $\ell$ is a set of $\ell$ encoded transmissions broadcast from the server such that all clients are satisfied. Finding the optimal (minimum) length of PICOD and designing PICOD schemes that have small length are the fundamental questions in PICOD. In this paper, we present a new lower bound for the optimal PICOD length using a new structural parameter called the nesting number, denoted by $\eta(\ch)$ associated with the hypergraph $\ch$ that represents the PICOD problem. While the nesting number bound is not stronger than previously known bounds, it can provide some computational advantages over them. Also, using the nesting number bound, we obtain novel lower bounds for some PICOD problems with special structures, which are tight in some cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[SecDiff: Diffusion-Aided Secure Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding Against Adversarial Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01466v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep joint source-channel coding (JSCC) has emerged as a promising paradigm for semantic communication, delivering significant performance gains over conventional separate coding schemes. However, existing JSCC frameworks remain vulnerable to physical-layer adversarial threats, such as pilot spoofing and subcarrier jamming, compromising semantic fidelity. In this paper, we propose SecDiff, a plug-and-play, diffusion-aided decoding framework that significantly enhances the security and robustness of deep JSCC under adversarial wireless environments. Different from prior diffusion-guided JSCC methods that suffer from high inference latency, SecDiff employs pseudoinverse-guided sampling and adaptive guidance weighting, enabling flexible step-size control and efficient semantic reconstruction. To counter jamming attacks, we introduce a power-based subcarrier masking strategy and recast recovery as a masked inpainting problem, solved via diffusion guidance. For pilot spoofing, we formulate channel estimation as a blind inverse problem and develop an expectation-minimization (EM)-driven reconstruction algorithm, guided jointly by reconstruction loss and a channel operator. Notably, our method alternates between pilot recovery and channel estimation, enabling joint refinement of both variables throughout the diffusion process. Extensive experiments over orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) channels under adversarial conditions show that SecDiff outperforms existing secure and generative JSCC baselines by achieving a favorable trade-off between reconstruction quality and computational cost. This balance makes SecDiff a promising step toward practical, low-latency, and attack-resilient semantic communications.</p></details> | 13 pages, 6 figures |

Foundation models provide powerful visual and multimodal embeddings, but nearest neighbor search in these high-dimensional spaces is computationally expensive. Hashing offers an efficient alternative by enabling fast Hamming distance search with binary codes, yet existing approaches often rely on complex pipelines, multi-term objectives, designs specialized for a single learning paradigm, and long training times. We introduce CroVCA (Cross-View Code Alignment), a simple and unified principle for learning binary codes that remain consistent across semantically aligned views. A single binary cross-entropy loss enforces alignment, while coding-rate maximization serves as an anti-collapse regularizer to promote balanced and diverse codes. To implement this, we design HashCoder, a lightweight MLP hashing network with a final batch normalization layer to enforce balanced codes. HashCoder can be used as a probing head on frozen embeddings or to adapt encoders efficiently via LoRA fine-tuning. Across benchmarks, CroVCA achieves state-of-the-art results in just 5 training epochs. At 16 bits, it particularly well-for instance, unsupervised hashing on COCO completes in under 2 minutes and supervised hashing on ImageNet100 in about 3 minutes on a single GPU. These results highlight CroVCA's efficiency, adaptability, and broad applicability.</p></details> |  |

| **[DeepHQ: Learned Hierarchical Quantizer for Progressive Deep Image Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.12150v2)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike fixed- or variable-rate image coding, progressive image coding (PIC) aims to compress various qualities of images into a single bitstream, increasing the versatility of bitstream utilization and providing high compression efficiency compared to simulcast compression. Research on neural network (NN)-based PIC is in its early stages, mainly focusing on applying varying quantization step sizes to the transformed latent representations in a hierarchical manner. These approaches are designed to compress only the progressively added information as the quality improves, considering that a wider quantization interval for lower-quality compression includes multiple narrower sub-intervals for higher-quality compression. However, the existing methods are based on handcrafted quantization hierarchies, resulting in sub-optimal compression efficiency. In this paper, we propose an NN-based progressive coding method that firstly utilizes learned quantization step sizes via learning for each quantization layer. We also incorporate selective compression with which only the essential representation components are compressed for each quantization layer. We demonstrate that our method achieves significantly higher coding efficiency than the existing approaches with decreased decoding time and reduced model size.

This process was mathematically modeled in [1], where the received sequence indicates the positions of the used labels. In this work, we develop error correcting codes for labeled DNA sequences, establishing bounds and constructing explicit systematic encoders for single substitution, insertion, and deletion errors. We focus on two cases: (1) using the complete set of length-two labels and (2) using the minimal set of length-two labels that ensures the recovery of DNA sequences from their labeling for 'almost' all DNA sequences.</p></details> |  |

The unassisted portion of the Tanner graphs corresponding to these codes, constructed from two distinct classical QC-LDPC codes, exhibits girth greater then 4 an essential property for effective error correction. We analytically derive the exact code rate of the proposed constructions. Remarkably, one of these families requires only a single Bell pair to be shared between the quantum transmitter and receiver. Furthermore, two additional families of EA-QC-QLDPC codes are constructed based on a single classical code, whose Tanner graphs exhibit girths exceeding six, thereby further enhancing the error-correction capability. For one of these families, we explicitly determine the transversal logical operators an aspect that is typically non-trivial for random quasi-cyclic codes. The performance of the proposed codes is assessed under both random and burst error models under the depolarizing and Markovian noise actions. Employing a modified sum-product decoding algorithm over a quaternary alphabet, we demonstrate that correlated Pauli errors can be effectively addressed within the decoding framework. Simulation results reveal nearly an order of improvement in error-correction performance with the quaternary decoder compared to the binary decoder over both depolarizing and Markovian channels. Further, the proposed codes are compared with existing ones, demonstrating significant improvement.</p></details> | <details><summary>57 pa...</summary><p>57 pages, 9 figures.

Identifying vulnerable functions in target binaries alone is insufficient; it is also crucial to determine whether these functions have been patched. Existing methods, however, suffer from limited usability and accuracy. They often depend on the compilation process to extract features, requiring substantial manual effort and failing for certain software. Moreover, they cannot reliably differentiate between code changes caused by patches or compilation variations. To overcome these limitations, we propose Lares, a scalable and accurate method for patch presence testing. Lares introduces Code Slice Semantic Search, which directly extracts features from the patch source code and identifies semantically equivalent code slices in the pseudocode of the target binary. By eliminating the need for the compilation process, Lares improves usability, while leveraging large language models (LLMs) for code analysis and SMT solvers for logical reasoning to enhance accuracy. Experimental results show that Lares achieves superior precision, recall, and usability. Furthermore, it is the first work to evaluate patch presence testing across optimization levels, architectures, and compilers. The datasets and source code used in this article are available at https://github.com/Siyuan-Li201/Lares.</p></details> |  |

The recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a compelling new paradigm: Neural Compilation, which could potentially simplify compiler development for new architectures and facilitate the discovery of innovative optimization techniques. However, several critical obstacles impede its practical adoption. Firstly, a significant lack of dedicated benchmarks and robust evaluation methodologies hinders objective assessment and tracking of progress in the field. Secondly, systematically enhancing the reliability and performance of LLM-generated assembly remains a critical challenge. Addressing these challenges, this paper introduces NeuComBack, a novel benchmark dataset specifically designed for IR-to-assembly compilation. Leveraging this dataset, we first define a foundational Neural Compilation workflow and conduct a comprehensive evaluation of the capabilities of recent frontier LLMs on Neural Compilation, establishing new performance baselines. We further propose a self-evolving prompt optimization method that enables LLMs to iteratively evolve their internal prompt strategies by extracting insights from prior self-debugging traces, thereby enhancing their neural compilation capabilities. Experiments demonstrate that our method significantly improves both the functional correctness and the performance of LLM-generated assembly code. Compared to baseline prompts, the functional correctness rates improved from 44% to 64% on x86_64 and from 36% to 58% on aarch64, respectively. More significantly, among the 16 correctly generated x86_64 programs using our method, 14 (87.5%) surpassed clang-O3 performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Existing studies have demonstrated the effectiveness of LLMs in code clone detection. However, two crucial issues remain unaddressed: the ability of LLMs to achieve comparable performance across different datasets and the consistency of LLMs' responses in code clone detection. To address these issues, we constructed seven code clone datasets and then evaluated five LLMs in four existing prompts with these datasets. The datasets were created by sampling code pairs using their Levenshtein ratio from two different code collections, CodeNet and BigCloneBench. Our evaluation revealed that although LLMs perform well in CodeNet-related datasets, with o3-mini achieving a 0.943 F1 score, their performance significantly decreased in BigCloneBench-related datasets. Most models achieved a high response consistency, with over 90\% of judgments remaining consistent across all five submissions. The fluctuations of the F1 score affected by inconsistency are also tiny; their variations are less than 0.03.</p></details> |  |
| **[RepoMark: A Data-Usage Auditing Framework for Code Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.21432v3)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation has transformed software development by automating coding tasks with unprecedented efficiency. However, the training of these models on open-source code repositories (e.g., from GitHub) raises critical ethical and legal concerns, particularly regarding data authorization and open-source license compliance. Developers are increasingly questioning whether model trainers have obtained proper authorization before using repositories for training, especially given the lack of transparency in data collection. To address these concerns, we propose a novel data marking framework RepoMark to audit the data usage of code LLMs. Our method enables auditors to verify whether their code has been used in training, while ensuring semantic preservation, imperceptibility, and theoretical false detection rate (FDR) guarantees. By generating multiple semantically equivalent code variants, RepoMark introduces data marks into the code files, and during detection, RepoMark leverages a novel ranking-based hypothesis test to detect model behavior difference on trained data. Compared to prior data auditing approaches, RepoMark significantly enhances data efficiency, allowing effective auditing even when the user's repository possesses only a small number of code files. Experiments demonstrate that RepoMark achieves a detection success rate over 90\% on small code repositories under a strict FDR guarantee of 5\%. This represents a significant advancement over existing data marking techniques, all of which only achieve accuracy below 55\% under identical settings. This further validates RepoMark as a robust, theoretically sound, and promising solution for enhancing transparency in code LLM training, which can safeguard the rights of code authors.</p></details> |  |

The approach relies on traversing the boundary in incremental steps. Starting from a corner point with Gaussian code-books, and relying on calculus of variation, it is shown that the end point in each step is achieved using Gaussian code-books. Optimality of Gaussian code-books is first established by limiting the random coding to independent and identically distributed scalar (single-letter) samples. Then, it is shown that the value of any optimum solution for vector inputs does not exceed that of the single-letter case. It is also shown that the maximum number of phases needed to realize the optimum time-sharing is two. It is established that the solution to the Han-Kobayashi achievable rate region, with single letter Gaussian code-books, achieves the optimum boundary. Even though the article focuses on weak interference, the results are applicable to the general case.</p></details> | 45 pages, 7 figures |

However, developers often struggle to interpret model outputs, limiting effective human-AI teaming. Prior work largely optimizes repaired code while under-addressing the natural-language feedback that enables comprehension and iterative improvement. We present DPO-f+, a novel framework that aligns code-repair feedback with developer needs and profiles. It (1) formalizes developer-profiled, domain-specific metrics for feedback alignment; (2) automatically constructs pairwise preference datasets from code-repair tasks; (3) fine-tunes using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) augmented with a lightweight margin signal; and (4) provides an automated feedback evaluation protocol. Empirically, DPO-f+ outperforms both the baseline and standard DPO on generated-code accuracy and overall feedback alignment. On novice programming tasks, DPO-f+ raises the top-1 pass rate by 5.71 percentage points (pp) over the baseline and by 3.30 pp over DPO. On the more challenging SWE-bench Lite benchmark, it increases the issue-resolution rate by 1.67 pp over DPO and by 4.67 pp over the baseline. It also achieves the largest improvement in feedback alignment, outperforming DPO and the baseline. By aligning feedback more closely with developer needs, DPO-f+ turns LLM-assisted repair from one-shot outputs into a collaborative sensemaking workflow, providing a practical approach to enhancing code comprehension and fostering more effective human-AI teaming in software engineering.</p></details> | 10 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Transformer-Based Decoding in Concatenated Coding Schemes Under Synchronization Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00999v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the reconstruction of a codeword from multiple noisy copies that are independently corrupted by insertions, deletions, and substitutions. This problem arises, for example, in DNA data storage. A common code construction uses a concatenated coding scheme that combines an outer linear block code with an inner code, which can be either a nonlinear marker code or a convolutional code. Outer decoding is done with Belief Propagation, and inner decoding is done with the Bahl-Cocke-Jelinek-Raviv (BCJR) algorithm. However, the BCJR algorithm scales exponentially with the number of noisy copies, which makes it infeasible to reconstruct a codeword from more than about four copies. In this work, we introduce BCJRFormer, a transformer-based neural inner decoder. BCJRFormer achieves error rates comparable to the BCJR algorithm for binary and quaternary single-message transmissions of marker codes. Importantly, BCJRFormer scales quadratically with the number of noisy copies. This property makes BCJRFormer well-suited for DNA data storage, where multiple reads of the same DNA strand occur. To lower error rates, we replace the Belief Propagation outer decoder with a transformer-based decoder. Together, these modifications yield an efficient and performant end-to-end transformer-based pipeline for decoding multiple noisy copies affected by insertion, deletion, and substitution errors.

This architecture extends BCJRFormer to decode transmissions of convolutional codewords, serving as an initial step toward joint inner and outer decoding for more general linear code classes.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 19 figures, a shortened version was published in the ISIT 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Token Choice for Code Watermarking: An RL Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11925v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Protecting intellectual property on LLM-generated code necessitates effective watermarking systems that can operate within code's highly structured, syntactically constrained nature. In this work, we introduce CodeTracer, an innovative adaptive code watermarking framework underpinned by a novel reinforcement learning training paradigm. At its core, CodeTracer features a policy-driven approach that utilizes a parameterized model to intelligently bias token choices during next-token prediction. This strategy ensures that embedded watermarks maintain code functionality while exhibiting subtle yet statistically detectable deviations from typical token distributions. To facilitate policy learning, we devise a comprehensive reward system that seamlessly integrates execution feedback with watermark embedding signals, balancing process-level and outcome-level rewards. Additionally, we employ Gumbel Top-k reparameterization to enable gradient-based optimization of discrete watermarking decisions. Extensive comparative evaluations demonstrate CodeTracer's significant superiority over state-of-the-art baselines in both watermark detectability and the preservation of generated code's functionality.</p></details> | 18 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Secure Distributed Consensus Estimation under False Data Injection Attacks: A Defense Strategy Based on Partial Channel Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00963v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This article investigates the security issue caused by false data injection attacks in distributed estimation, wherein each sensor can construct two types of residues based on local estimates and neighbor information, respectively. The resource-constrained attacker can select partial channels from the sensor network and arbitrarily manipulate the transmitted data. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions to reveal system vulnerabilities, under which the attacker is able to diverge the estimation error while preserving the stealthiness of all residues. We propose two defense strategies with mechanisms of exploiting the Euclidean distance between local estimates to detect attacks, and adopting the coding scheme to protect the transmitted data, respectively. It is proven that the former has the capability to address the majority of security loopholes, while the latter can serve as an additional enhancement to the former. By employing the time-varying coding matrix to mitigate the risk of being cracked, we demonstrate that the latter can safeguard against adversaries injecting stealthy sequences into the encoded channels. Hence, drawing upon the security analysis, we further provide a procedure to select security-critical channels that need to be encoded, thereby achieving a trade-off between security and coding costs. Finally, some numerical simulations are conducted to demonstrate the theoretical results.</p></details> |  |

The derived bounds improve previous results in certain parameter regimes and match the bandwidth cost of the construction proposed by Maturana and Rashmi (2022 IEEE International Symposium on Information Theory) for $r^F\le r^I\le k^F$, implying that our bounds are tight in this case.</p></details> |  |
| **[HyRES: A Hybrid Replication and Erasure Coding Approach to Data Storage](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00896v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reliability in distributed storage systems has typically focused on the design and deployment of data replication or erasure coding techniques. Although some scenarios have considered the use of replication for hot data and erasure coding for cold data in the same system, each is designed in isolation. We propose HyRES, a hybrid scheme incorporates the best characteristics of each scheme, thus, resulting in additional design flexibility and better potential performance for the system. We show that HyRES generalizes previously proposed hybrid schemes. We characterize the theoretical performance of HyRES as well as that of replication and erasure coding considering the effects of the size of the storage networks. We validate our theoretical results using simulations. These results show that HyRES can yield simultaneously lower storage costs than replication, lower probabilities of file loss than replication and erasure coding with similar worst case performance, and even lower effective repair traffic than replication when considering the network size.</p></details> | 6 pages, 5 figures |
| **[A Comprehensive Empirical Evaluation of Agent Frameworks on Code-centric Software Engineering Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00872v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike traditional automation tools or static LLM-based systems, agents combine decision-making and tool utilization to accomplish complex tasks, showing great potential in software engineering. However, existing studies largely focus on specific tasks or isolated aspects, providing an incomplete picture of agents' practical capabilities. To address this, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study evaluating seven general-purpose agent frameworks across three representative code-centric tasks: software development, vulnerability detection, and program repair. Each task is assessed using standard, widely adopted benchmarks to ensure objective and comparable evaluation. Agent performance is systematically analyzed from three complementary perspectives: effectiveness (task success), efficiency (execution process), and overhead (token consumption). Our findings reveal distinct capability patterns and trade-offs among the evaluated frameworks. In terms of effectiveness, agents achieve moderate overall performance. Regarding efficiency, AgentOrchestra tends to exhibit the longest trajectories and the most correction attempts due to coordination overhead, whereas OpenHands demonstrate stronger reflective reasoning abilities. For overhead, software development incurs the highest monetary cost, while GPTswarm remains the most cost-efficient. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth cross-analysis of the relationship between effectiveness and efficiency, exploring the underlying reasons behind their interplay. These findings guide both practical adoption and future research toward more efficient software engineering agents.</p></details> |  |

However, even with significant efforts in building compilers, programming these tensor accelerators remains challenging, leaving much of their potential underutilized. Recently, large language models (LLMs), trained on large amounts of code, have shown significant promise in code generation and optimization tasks, but generating low-resource languages, such as specialized tensor accelerator code still poses a significant challenge. We tackle this challenge with Autocomp, an approach that empowers accelerator programmers to leverage domain knowledge and hardware feedback to optimize code via an automated LLM-driven search. We accomplish this by: 1) formulating each optimization pass as a structured two-phase prompt, divided into planning and code generation phases, 2) inserting domain knowledge during planning via a concise and adaptable optimization menu, and 3) integrating correctness and performance metrics from hardware as feedback at each search iteration. Across three distinct hardware platforms, we demonstrate that Autocomp-optimized code runs 5.6x faster than the vendor-provided library (Gemmini), outperforms expert-level hand-tuned code by 1.9x (AWS Trainium), and achieves 3.8x higher performance than a machine learning-based cost model for GPUs (NVIDIA L40S). Additionally, we demonstrate that optimization schedules generated from Autocomp can be reused across similar tensor operations, improving speedups by up to 24% under a fixed sample budget.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages + appendices</p></details> |
| **[An Elementary Approach to MacWilliams Extension Property and Constant Weight Code with Respect to Weighted Hamming Metric](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00809v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we characterize the MacWilliams extension property (MEP) and constant weight codes with respect to $\omega$-weight defined on $\mathbb{F}^{\Omega}$ via an elementary approach, where $\mathbb{F}$ is a finite field, $\Omega$ is a finite set, and $\omega:\Omega\longrightarrow\mathbb{R}^{+}$ is a weight function. Our approach relies solely on elementary linear algebra and two key identities for $\omega$-weight of subspaces derived from a double-counting argument. When $\omega$ is the constant $1$ map, our results recover two well-known results for Hamming metric code: (1) any Hamming weight preserving map between linear codes extends to a Hamming weight isometry of the entire ambient space; and (2) any constant weight Hamming metric code is a repetition of the dual of Hamming code.</p></details> |  |
| **[GrowthHacker: Automated Off-Policy Evaluation Optimization Using Code-Modifying LLM Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00802v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the software industry shifting toward a data-driven culture, online A/B testing is a key tool for evaluating new technologies. However, deploying such experiments requires substantial resources, may negatively impact users, and involves long data collection periods. To address this, \textit{off-policy evaluation (OPE)}, or offline A/B testing, uses logged data to assess technologies and is fundamental in Reinforcement Learning, making it crucial in domains where online testing is costly or risky, such as healthcare, recommender systems, education, dialog systems, and robotics. Despite advances in coding LLMs and agentic AI, little is known about leveraging them to optimize OPE results. We investigate whether LLMs and LLM-based agents can improve OPE performance via code optimization. We propose \textit{GrowthHacker}, a benchmark with agent and baseline methods on large-scale real-world datasets, which iteratively optimizes code, evaluates results, and begins new optimization cycles. We collected datasets, established protocols, implemented baselines for OPE on the Open Bandit Pipeline (OBP)~\cite{saito2021openbanditdatasetpipeline} and Scope-RL~\cite{kiyohara2023scope}, and developed the \textit{two_agent} framework, which reduces system complexity while preserving optimization effectiveness. Results show the two_agent framework achieves 100% reliability and the highest average improvement of 106.7% among positive outcomes. Both two_agent and CrewAI reach 45% success rates, outperforming AutoGen's 34%. These findings demonstrate the feasibility of LLM-based agents as automated "growth hackers" to enhance OPE systems, with implications for scaling data-driven decision-making in production.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Literature Review of Code Hallucinations in LLMs: Characterization, Mitigation Methods, Challenges, and Future Directions for Reliable AI](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00776v1)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model hallucination is one of the most critical challenges faced by Large Language Models (LLMs), especially in high-stakes code intelligence tasks. As LLMs become increasingly integrated into software engineering tasks, understanding and mitigating hallucination in code becomes essential. In this survey, we provide a systematic review of hallucination phenomena in code-oriented LLMs from four key perspectives. First, we begin by surveying 60 papers to define hallucination in the context of code and summarize its primary causes, such as data noise, exposure bias, and insufficient semantic grounding, while also tracing recent trends in literature across natural language processing (NLP) and software engineering communities. Second, we review model hallucination surveys in a broader span and summarize representative hallucination mitigation strategies, such as knowledge-enhanced generation, constrained decoding, and post-editing. Third, we review approaches targeted for code intelligence and highlight code-specific challenges that aggravate hallucination, including syntax sensitivity, strict type systems, and dependence on external libraries. Meanwhile, we analyze how emerging code intelligence tasks, e.g., program analysis, symbolic execution, and unit testing, are utilized to detect and mitigate hallucinations. Fourth, we summarize current evaluation benchmarks, ranging from static metrics to dynamic checks, e.g., compilation and execution correctness, and emphasize the need for hallucination-oriented benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[RepoScope: Leveraging Call Chain-Aware Multi-View Context for Repository-Level Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.14791v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repository-level code generation aims to generate code within the context of a specified repository. Existing approaches typically employ retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) techniques to provide LLMs with relevant contextual information extracted from the repository. However, these approaches often struggle with effectively identifying truly relevant contexts that capture the rich semantics of the repository, and their contextual perspectives remains narrow. Moreover, most approaches fail to account for the structural relationships in the retrieved code during prompt construction, hindering the LLM's ability to accurately interpret the context. To address these issues, we propose RepoScope, which leverages call chain-aware multi-view context for repository-level code generation. RepoScope constructs a Repository Structural Semantic Graph (RSSG) and retrieves a comprehensive four-view context, integrating both structural and similarity-based contexts. We propose a novel call chain prediction method that utilizes the repository's structural semantics to improve the identification of callees in the target function. Additionally, we present a structure-preserving serialization algorithm for prompt construction, ensuring the coherence of the context for the LLM. Notably, RepoScope relies solely on static analysis, eliminating the need for additional training or multiple LLM queries, thus ensuring both efficiency and generalizability. Evaluation on widely-used repository-level code generation benchmarks (CoderEval and DevEval) demonstrates that RepoScope outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving up to a 36.35% relative improvement in pass@1 scores. Further experiments emphasize RepoScope's potential to improve code generation across different tasks and its ability to integrate effectively with existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2026</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Autoregression: An Empirical Study of Diffusion Large Language Models for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.11252v2)** | 2025-11-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have become the mainstream approaches to code generation. Existing LLMs mainly employ autoregressive generation, i.e. generating code token-by-token from left to right. However, the underlying autoregressive generation has two limitations in code generation. First, autoregressive LLMs only generate a token at each step, showing low efficiency in practice. Second, programming is a non-sequential process involving back-and-forth editing, while autoregressive LLMs only employ the left-to-right generation order. These two intrinsic limitations hinder the further development of LLMs in code generation. Recently, diffusion LLMs have emerged as a promising alternative. Diffusion LLMs address the above limitations with two advances, including multi-token prediction (i.e. generating multiple tokens at each step) and flexible generation order (i.e. flexibly determining which positions to generate tokens). However, there is no systematic study exploring diffusion LLMs in code generation. To bridge the knowledge gap, we present the first empirical study of diffusion LLMs for code generation. Our study involves 9 representative diffusion LLMs and conduct experiments on 4 widely used benchmarks. Based on the results, we summarize the following findings. (1) Existing diffusion LLMs are competitive with autoregressive LLMs with similar sizes. (2) Diffusion LLMs have a stronger length extrapolation ability than autoregressive LLMs and perform better in long code understanding. (3) We explore factors impacting the effectiveness and efficiency of diffusion LLMs, and provide practical guidance. (4) We discuss several promising further directions to improve diffusion LLMs on code generation. We open-source all source code, data, and results to facilitate the following research.

| **[\texttt{ReMind}: Understanding Deductive Code Reasoning in LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00488v1)** | 2025-11-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in code-related tasks. Despite their advancement, empirical evidence reveals that they still struggle with \emph{deductive code reasoning}, the ability to reason about the program execution process. While prior studies have recognized this limitation, the underlying causes remain largely underexplored. In this paper, we begin by presenting a comprehensive empirical study that reveals three key challenges undermining deductive code reasoning: (1) an intrinsic gap between generation and reasoning abilities, (2) a consistent bias towards code sources, and (3) weak zero-shot generalization on complex benchmarks. In light of these challenges, we propose \texttt{ReMind}, a multi-agent framework composed of \texttt{Mutator}, \texttt{Executor}, and \texttt{Inspector}. The \texttt{Mutator} generates code variants to mitigate bias towards code sources, the \texttt{Executor} traces variable states step-by-step to expose inconsistency, and the \texttt{Inspector} identifies problematic reasoning steps and provides control-flow refinement to bridge the intrinsic reasoning gap. Through their coordinated collaboration, \texttt{ReMind} systematically identifies and refines reasoning flaws, achieving outstanding performance and enabling robust zero-shot generalization. Extensive experiments on two benchmarks with five LLMs demonstrate the superior advantages of \texttt{ReMind} compared to baseline approaches in deductive code reasoning.</p></details> |  |

This study assesses the potential of large language models (LLMs) to assign ICPC-2 codes using the output of a domain-specific search engine. Methods: A dataset of 437 Brazilian Portuguese clinical expressions, each annotated with ICPC-2 codes, was used. A semantic search engine (OpenAI's text-embedding-3-large) retrieved candidates from 73,563 labeled concepts. Thirty-three LLMs were prompted with each query and retrieved results to select the best-matching ICPC-2 code. Performance was evaluated using F1-score, along with token usage, cost, response time, and format adherence. Results: Twenty-eight models achieved F1-score > 0.8; ten exceeded 0.85. Top performers included gpt-4.5-preview, o3, and gemini-2.5-pro. Retriever optimization can improve performance by up to 4 points. Most models returned valid codes in the expected format, with reduced hallucinations. Smaller models (<3B) struggled with formatting and input length. Conclusions: LLMs show strong potential for automating ICPC-2 coding, even without fine-tuning. This work offers a benchmark and highlights challenges, but findings are limited by dataset scope and setup. Broader, multilingual, end-to-end evaluations are needed for clinical validation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 as a poster presentation in The Second Workshop on GenAI for Health: Potential, Trust, and Policy Compliance (https://openreview.net/forum?id=Kl7KZwJFEG). 33 pages, 10 figures (including appendix), 15 tables (including appendix).

Despite the notable success of recent vision-language models (VLMs) on specialized tasks like Chart-to-code generation, their reliance on single-task training regimens fosters a narrow paradigm that hinders the development of generalized \textbf{VI}sio\textbf{N} \textbf{C}ode \textbf{I}ntelligence. In this work, we introduce \textbf{VinciCoder}, a unified multimodal code generation model that addresses this limitation via a two-stage training framework. We begin by constructing a large-scale Supervised Finetuning (SFT) corpus comprising 1.6M image-code pairs for tasks involving direct code generation and visual-based code refinement. Subsequently, we introduce a Visual Reinforcement Learning (ViRL) strategy, which employs a coarse-to-fine reward mechanism to improve visual fidelity by calculating visual similarity across local and global image patches. Extensive experiments on various multimodal code generation benchmarks demonstrate that VinciCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance, underscoring the effectiveness of our coarse-to-fine ViRL strategy.

Human-AI Collaboration for Code Comprehension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04553v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding an unfamiliar codebase is an essential task for developers in various scenarios, such as during the onboarding process. Existing studies have shown that LLMs often fail to support users in understanding code structures or to provide user-centered, adaptive, and dynamic assistance in real-world settings. To address this, we propose learning from the perspective of a unique role, code auditors, whose work often requires them to quickly familiarize themselves with new code projects on weekly or even daily basis. To achieve this, we recruited and interviewed 8 code auditing practitioners to understand how they master codebase understanding. We identified several design opportunities for an LLM-based codebase understanding system: supporting cognitive alignment through automated codebase information extraction, decomposition, and representation, as well as reducing manual effort and conversational distraction through interaction design. To validate them, we designed a prototype, CodeMap, that provides dynamic information extraction and representation aligned with the human cognitive flow and enables interactive switching among hierarchical codebase visualizations. To evaluate the usefulness of our system, we conducted a user study with nine experienced developers and six novice developers. Our results demonstrate that CodeMap improved users' perceived intuitiveness, ease of use, and usefulness in supporting code comprehension, while reducing their reliance on reading and interpreting LLM responses by 79% and increasing map usage time by 90% compared with the static visualization analysis tool. It also enhances novice developers' perceived understanding and reduces their unpurposeful exploration.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding for Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15347v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As video transmission increasingly serves machine vision systems (MVS) instead of human vision systems (HVS), video coding for machines (VCM) has become a critical research topic. Existing VCM methods often bind codecs to specific downstream models, requiring retraining or supervised data, thus limiting generalization in multi-task scenarios. Recently, unified VCM frameworks have employed visual backbones (VB) and visual foundation models (VFM) to support multiple video understanding tasks with a single codec. They mainly utilize VB/VFM to maintain semantic consistency or suppress non-semantic information, but seldom explore how to directly link video coding with understanding under VB/VFM guidance. Hence, we propose a Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding framework for Machines (SEC-VCM). It establishes a symmetric alignment between the video codec and VB, allowing the codec to leverage VB's representation capabilities to preserve semantics and discard MVS-irrelevant information. Specifically, a bi-directional entropy-constraint (BiEC) mechanism ensures symmetry between the process of video decoding and VB encoding by suppressing conditional entropy. This helps the codec to explicitly handle semantic information beneficial to MVS while squeezing useless information. Furthermore, a semantic-pixel dual-path fusion (SPDF) module injects pixel-level priors into the final reconstruction. Through semantic-pixel fusion, it suppresses artifacts harmful to MVS and improves machine-oriented reconstruction quality. Experimental results show our framework achieves state-of-the-art~(SOTA) in rate-task performance, with significant bitrate savings over VTM on video instance segmentation (37.4%), video object segmentation (29.8%), object detection (46.2%), and multiple object tracking (44.9%).

This paper introduces DocPrism, a multi-language, code-documentation inconsistency detection tool. DocPrism uses a standard large language model (LLM) to analyze and explain inconsistencies. Plain use of LLMs for this task yield unacceptably high false positive rates: LLMs identify natural gaps between high-level documentation and detailed code implementations as inconsistencies. We introduce and apply the Local Categorization, External Filtering (LCEF) methodology to reduce false positives. LCEF relies on the LLM's local completion skills rather than its long-term reasoning skills. In our ablation study, LCEF reduces DocPrism's inconsistency flag rate from 98% to 14%, and increases accuracy from 14% to 94%. On a broad evaluation across Python, TypeScript, C++, and Java, DocPrism maintains a low flag rate of 15%, and achieves a precision of 0.62 without performing any fine-tuning.</p></details> |  |

However, developers report key limitations including the accumulation of technical debt, security issues, and code churn to achieve satisfactory results. We argue that these pitfalls result from LLMs' inability to reconcile accumulating human-imposed constraints during vibe coding, with developers inadvertently failing to resolve contradictions because LLMs prioritize user commands over code consistency. Given LLMs' receptiveness to verification-based feedback, we argue that formal methods can mitigate these pitfalls, making vibe coding more reliable. However, we posit that integrating formal methods must transcend existing approaches that combine formal methods and LLMs. We advocate for a side-car system throughout the vibe coding process which: (1) \emph{Autoformalizes} specifications (2) Validates against targets, (3) Delivers \emph{actionable} feedback to the LLM, and (4) Allows intuitive developer influence on specifications.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 3 figures, In Proceedings of the 1st ACM SIGPLAN International Workshop on Language Models and Programming Languages (LMPL'25), October 12-18, 2025, Singapore, Singapore.

| **[Understanding Code Agent Behaviour: An Empirical Study of Success and Failure Trajectories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.00197v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing deployment of Large Language Model (LLM) agents for complex software engineering tasks has created a need to understand their problem-solving behaviours beyond simple success metrics. While these agents demonstrate impressive capabilities in automated issue resolution, their decision-making processes remain largely opaque. This paper presents an empirical study of agent trajectories, namely the execution traces capturing the steps agents take when attempting to resolve software issues. We analyse trajectories from three state-of-the-art code agents (OpenHands, SWE-agent, and Prometheus) on the SWE-Bench benchmark, examining both successful and failed attempts. Our investigation reveals several key insights into agent behaviour. First, we identify how distinct problem-solving strategies, such as defensive programming and context gathering, enable success in different scenarios. Second, we find that failed trajectories are consistently longer and exhibit higher variance than successful ones, with failure patterns differing significantly between agents. Third, our fault localisation analysis shows that while most trajectories correctly identify problematic files (72-81\% even in failures), success depends more on achieving approximate rather than exact code modifications. These and other findings unveiled by our study, provide a foundation for understanding agent behaviour through trajectory analysis, contributing to the development of more robust and interpretable autonomous software engineering systems.</p></details> |  |

In this paper we explore the use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code migration, specifically the problem of maintaining compatibility with a dependency as it undergoes major and minor semantic version changes. We demonstrate, using metrics such as test coverage and change comparisons, that contexts containing diffs can significantly improve performance against out of the box LLMs and, in some cases, perform better than using code. We provide a dataset to assist in further development of this problem area, as well as an open-source Python package, AIMigrate, that can be used to assist with migrating code bases. In a real-world migration of TYPHOIDSIM between STARSIM versions, AIMigrate correctly identified 65% of required changes in a single run, increasing to 80% with multiple runs, with 47% of changes generated perfectly.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[On Selecting Few-Shot Examples for LLM-based Code Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27675v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities for many coding tasks, including summarization, translation, completion, and code generation. However, detecting code vulnerabilities remains a challenging task for LLMs. An effective way to improve LLM performance is in-context learning (ICL) - providing few-shot examples similar to the query, along with correct answers, can improve an LLM's ability to generate correct solutions. However, choosing the few-shot examples appropriately is crucial to improving model performance. In this paper, we explore two criteria for choosing few-shot examples for ICL used in the code vulnerability detection task. The first criterion considers if the LLM (consistently) makes a mistake or not on a sample with the intuition that LLM performance on a sample is informative about its usefulness as a few-shot example. The other criterion considers similarity of the examples with the program under query and chooses few-shot examples based on the $k$-nearest neighbors to the given sample. We perform evaluations to determine the benefits of these criteria individually as well as under various combinations, using open-source models on multiple datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeAlignBench: Assessing Code Generation Models on Developer-Preferred Code Adjustments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27565v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models become increasingly capable of generating code, evaluating their performance remains a complex and evolving challenge. Existing benchmarks primarily focus on functional correctness, overlooking the diversity of real-world coding tasks and developer expectations. To this end, we introduce a multi-language benchmark that evaluates LLM instruction-following capabilities and is extensible to operate on any set of standalone coding problems. Our benchmark evaluates instruction following in two key settings: adherence to pre-defined constraints specified with the initial problem, and the ability to perform refinements based on follow-up instructions. For this paper's analysis, we empirically evaluated our benchmarking pipeline with programming tasks from LiveBench, that are also automatically translated from Python into Java and JavaScript. Our automated benchmark reveals that models exhibit differing levels of performance across multiple dimensions of instruction-following. Our benchmarking pipeline provides a more comprehensive evaluation of code generation models, highlighting their strengths and limitations across languages and generation goals.</p></details> |  |

This has motivated research on methods to automatically create control policies. However, these methods require iterative processes of manually crafting and refining objective functions, thereby prolonging the development cycle. This work introduces \textit{GenSwarm}, an end-to-end system that leverages large language models to automatically generate and deploy control policies for multi-robot tasks based on simple user instructions in natural language. As a multi-language-agent system, GenSwarm achieves zero-shot learning, enabling rapid adaptation to altered or unseen tasks. The white-box nature of the code policies ensures strong reproducibility and interpretability. With its scalable software and hardware architectures, GenSwarm supports efficient policy deployment on both simulated and real-world multi-robot systems, realizing an instruction-to-execution end-to-end functionality that could prove valuable for robotics specialists and non-specialists alike.The code of the proposed GenSwarm system is available online: https://github.com/WindyLab/GenSwarm.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in npj Robotics</p></details> |

In this paper, we ask the following important question: can we accurately reconstruct the visual scene using only a very small portion of the bit rate in existing coding methods while not sacrificing the accuracy of vision analysis and performance of human interactions? Existing text-to-image generation models offer a new approach for ultra-low bitrate image description. However, they can only achieve a semantic-level approximation of the visual scene, which is far insufficient for the purpose of visual communication and remote vision analysis and human interactions. To address this important issue, we propose to seamlessly integrate image generation with deep image compression, using joint text and coding latent to guide the rectified flow models for precise generation of the visual scene. The semantic text description and coding latent are both encoded and transmitted to the decoder at a very small bit rate. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can achieve the same image reconstruction quality and vision analysis accuracy as existing methods while using much less bandwidth. The code will be released upon paper acceptance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Emulating Semantic Translation Help LLMs with Code Translation? A Study Based on Pseudocode](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.00920v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) show great potential in code translation. However, accurate translation remains challenging when using the commonly adopted direct code-to-code translation approach, which converts a program into the target programming language (PL) in a single step. Inspired by the success of incorporating intermediate steps to guide LLMs in resolving challenging tasks, we explore pseudocode-based code translation, which emulates the human semantic translation by first interpreting the program's intent and logic into pseudocode and then implementing it in the target PL. We find that pseudocode-based translation helps translate programs that direct translation struggles to handle. Nonetheless, the effectiveness, advantages, and limitations of this approach remain underexplored. To bridge this gap, we present an empirical study on pseudocode-based code translation, aiming to investigate its effectiveness in enhancing the direct translation approach, illuminate its effective usage, and identify limitations hindering its potential benefits. By comparing direct and pseudocode-based translation approaches on 9,690 translation tasks across six PLs with five popular LLMs, we demonstrate that pseudocode-based translation can effectively complement direct translation, particularly when translating from flexible to rigid PLs or dealing with low-resource Rust. Based on these findings, we suggest adopting strategies that combine the complementary strengths of both approaches to enhance code translation accuracy. We also reveal the advantages of pseudocode-based translation in disentangling translations of complicated programs and mitigating distractions from detailed implementations in original programs, as well as its limitations due to incorrect, incomplete, or ambiguous pseudocode.</p></details> |  |

Notebooks uniquely combine scripts with documentation. With the emergence of generative AI (GenAI) technologies, it is increasingly important, especially in competitive settings, to distinguish the characteristics of human-written versus GenAI. In this study, we present three case studies to explore potential strengths of both humans and GenAI through the coding and documenting activities in notebooks. We first characterize differences between 25 code and documentation features in human-written, medal-winning Kaggle notebooks. We find that gold medalists are primarily distinguished by longer and more detailed documentation. Second, we analyze the distinctions between human-written and GenAI notebooks. Our results show that while GenAI notebooks tend to achieve higher code quality (as measured by metrics like code smells and technical debt), human-written notebooks display greater structural diversity, complexity, and innovative approaches to problem-solving. Based on these results, we envision the work as groundwork that highlight four agendas to further investigate how GenAI could be utilized in notebooks that maximizes the potential collaboration between human and AI.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the AIware 2025 - Main Track</p></details> |

The core component is the item code, generally derived by quantizing collaborative or semantic representations to serve as candidate items identifiers in the context. However, existing methods typically construct separate codes for each modality, leading to higher computational and storage costs and hindering the integration of their complementary strengths. Considering this limitation, we seek to integrate two different modalities into a unified code, fully unleashing the potential of complementary nature among modalities. Nevertheless, the integration remains challenging: the integrated embedding obtained by the common concatenation method would lead to underutilization of collaborative knowledge, thereby resulting in limited effectiveness. To address this, we propose a novel method, named UNGER, which integrates semantic and collaborative knowledge into a unified code for generative recommendation. Specifically, we propose to adaptively learn an integrated embedding through the joint optimization of cross-modality knowledge alignment and next item prediction tasks. Subsequently, to mitigate the information loss caused by the quantization process, we introduce an intra-modality knowledge distillation task, using the integrated embeddings as supervised signals to compensate. Extensive experiments on three widely used benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of our approach compared to existing methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by TOIS 2025</p></details> |
| **[LLM Based Long Code Translation using Identifier Replacement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09045v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the domain of software development, LLMs have been utilized to automate tasks such as code translation, where source code from one programming language is translated to another while preserving its functionality. However, LLMs often struggle with long source codes that don't fit into the context window, which produces inaccurate translations. To address this, we propose a novel zero-shot code translation method that incorporates identifier replacement. By substituting user-given long identifiers with generalized placeholders during translation, our method allows the LLM to focus on the logical structure of the code, by reducing token count and memory usage, which improves the efficiency and cost-effectiveness of long code translation. Our empirical results demonstrate that our approach preserves syntactical and hierarchical information and produces translation results with reduced tokens.</p></details> |  |
| **[RepoMasterEval: Evaluating Code Completion via Real-World Repositories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.03519v2)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the growing reliance on automated code completion tools in software development, the need for comprehensive evaluation benchmarks has become critical. Existing benchmarks focus more on code completion in function and class level by providing text descriptions to prompt the model. By contrast, such descriptive prompt is commonly unavailable in real development and code completion can occur in wider range of situations such as in the middle of a function or a code block. These limitations makes existing evaluation benchmarks poorly align with the practical scenarios of code completion tools. In this paper, we propose RepoMasterEval, a novel benchmark for evaluating code completion models constructed from real-world repositories. Each benchmark datum is generated by masking a code snippet (ground truth) from one source code file with existing test suites. To improve test accuracy of model generated code, we employ mutation testing to measure the effectiveness of the test cases and we manually crafted new test cases for those test suites with low mutation score. Our empirical evaluation on 10 state-of-the-art models shows that test argumentation is critical in improving the accuracy of the benchmark and RepoMasterEval is able to report variance in model performance in real-world scenarios. The deployment of RepoMasterEval also revealed that the benchmark is useful to give accurate feedback during model training and the score is in high correlation with the model's performance in practice.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vintage Code, Modern Judges: Meta-Validation in Low Data Regimes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.27244v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Application modernization in legacy languages such as COBOL, PL/I, and REXX faces an acute shortage of resources, both in expert availability and in high-quality human evaluation data. While Large Language Models as a Judge (LaaJ) offer a scalable alternative to expert review, their reliability must be validated before being trusted in high-stakes workflows. Without principled validation, organizations risk a circular evaluation loop, where unverified LaaJs are used to assess model outputs, potentially reinforcing unreliable judgments and compromising downstream deployment decisions. Although various automated approaches to validating LaaJs have been proposed, alignment with human judgment remains a widely used and conceptually grounded validation strategy. In many real-world domains, the availability of human-labeled evaluation data is severely limited, making it difficult to assess how well a LaaJ aligns with human judgment. We introduce SparseAlign, a formal framework for assessing LaaJ alignment with sparse human-labeled data. SparseAlign combines a novel pairwise-confidence concept with a score-sensitive alignment metric that jointly capture ranking consistency and score proximity, enabling reliable evaluator selection even when traditional statistical methods are ineffective due to limited annotated examples. SparseAlign was applied internally to select LaaJs for COBOL code explanation. The top-aligned evaluators were integrated into assessment workflows, guiding model release decisions. We present a case study of four LaaJs to demonstrate SparseAlign's utility in real-world evaluation scenarios.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we provide ten practical rules for AI-assisted coding that balance leveraging capabilities of AI with maintaining scientific and methodological rigor. We address how AI can be leveraged strategically throughout the development cycle with four key themes: problem preparation and understanding, managing context and interaction, testing and validation, and code quality assurance and iterative improvement. These principles serve to emphasize maintaining human agency in coding decisions, establishing robust validation procedures, and preserving the domain expertise essential for methodologically sound research. These rules are intended to help researchers harness AI's transformative potential for faster software development while ensuring that their code meets the standards of reliability, reproducibility, and scientific validity that research integrity demands.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages of content; 1 table; 1 page appendix</p></details> |

Despite their lack of formal characterization, these models are widely adopted in both industry and academia. To address this issue, formalizing the execution semantics of business process modeling languages is essential. Since data and process are two facets of the same coin, and data are critical elements in the execution of process models, this work introduces Proving an eXecutable BPMN injected with data, BPMN-ProX. BPMN-ProX is a low-code testing framework that significantly enhances the verification of data-aware BPMN. This low-code platform helps bridge the gap between non-technical experts and professionals by proposing a tool that integrates advanced data handling and employs a robust verification mechanism through state-of-the-art model checkers. This innovative approach combines theoretical verification with practical modeling, fostering more agile, reliable, and user-centric business process management.</p></details> |  |
| **[SELF-REDRAFT: Eliciting Intrinsic Exploration-Exploitation Balance in Test-Time Scaling for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02854v1)** | 2025-10-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Test-time scaling without interpreter feedback is essential for real-world code generation scenarios where test cases are not readily available. While existing paradigms often rely on either greedy exploitation (i.e., iterative refinement) or stochastic exploration (i.e., relying on sample-based voting or reranking mechanisms), the balance between these two dimensions remains underexplored. To investigate the LLM's intrinsic ability to balance exploitation and exploration, we introduce SELF-REDRAFT, a framework built upon Self-Refine that encourages the model to propose new drafts for solutions that are fundamentally flawed. Our results show that SELF-REDRAFT consistently achieves better performance than Self-Refine when converged under the same maximum number of iterations. Still, we observe that significant room for improvement remains, largely due to two core aspects of current self-redraft capabilities: constrained capacity for generating instructive feedback and fragile discriminative judgment. We also find that balancing strategies vary notably across different LLMs, reflecting distinct, model-specific behaviors. Overall, our study establishes a baseline for intrinsic exploration-exploitation balancing in test-time scaling and identifies feedback and discrimination as key areas with potential for future advances.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 8 figures,2 tables</p></details> |

These scripts are ubiquitous in modern software development pipelines for streamlining testing and delivery. While developing build scripts, practitioners may inadvertently introduce code smells, which are recurring patterns of poor coding practices that may lead to build failures or increase risk and technical debt. The goal of this study is to aid practitioners in avoiding code smells in build scripts through an empirical study of build scripts and issues on GitHub.We employed a mixed-methods approach, combining qualitative and quantitative analysis. First, we conducted a qualitative analysis of 2000 build-script-related GitHub issues to understand recurring smells. Next, we developed a static analysis tool, Sniffer, to automatically detect code smells in 5882 build scripts of Maven, Gradle, CMake, and Make files, collected from 4877 open-source GitHub repositories. To assess Sniffer's performance, we conducted a user study, where Sniffer achieved higher precision, recall, and F-score. We identified 13 code smell categories, with a total of 10,895 smell occurrences, where 3184 were in Maven, 1214 in Gradle, 337 in CMake, and 6160 in Makefiles. Our analysis revealed that Insecure URLs were the most prevalent code smell in Maven build scripts, while HardcodedPaths/URLs were commonly observed in both Gradle and CMake scripts. Wildcard Usage emerged as the most frequent smell in Makefiles. The co-occurrence analysis revealed strong associations between specific smell pairs of Hardcoded Paths/URLs with Duplicates, and Inconsistent Dependency Management with Empty or Incomplete Tags, which indicate potential underlying issues in the build script structure and maintenance practices.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 5 tables, 2 figures</p></details> |

The multilevel construction is one of the most effective ways to construct constant dimension codes. The paper is devoted to constructing CDCs by the multilevel construction. Precisely, we first choose an appropriate skeleton code based on the transformations of binary vectors related to the one-factorization of complete graphs; then we construct CDCs by using the chosen skeleton code, where quasi-pending blocks are used; finally, we calculate the dimensions by use of known constructions of optimal Ferrers diagram rank metric codes. As applications, we improve the lower bounds of $\overline{A}_q(n,8,6)$ for $16\leq n\leq 19.$</p></details> |  |
| **[Process-based Indicators of Vulnerability Re-Introducing Code Changes: An Exploratory Case Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26676v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software vulnerabilities often persist or re-emerge even after being fixed, revealing the complex interplay between code evolution and socio-technical factors. While source code metrics provide useful indicators of vulnerabilities, software engineering process metrics can uncover patterns that lead to their introduction. Yet few studies have explored whether process metrics can reveal risky development activities over time -- insights that are essential for anticipating and mitigating software vulnerabilities. This work highlights the critical role of process metrics along with code changes in understanding and mitigating vulnerability reintroduction. We move beyond file-level prediction and instead analyze security fixes at the commit level, focusing not only on whether a single fix introduces a vulnerability but also on the longer sequences of changes through which vulnerabilities evolve and re-emerge. Our approach emphasizes that reintroduction is rarely the result of one isolated action, but emerges from cumulative development activities and socio-technical conditions. To support this analysis, we conducted a case study on the ImageMagick project by correlating longitudinal process metrics such as bus factor, issue density, and issue spoilage with vulnerability reintroduction activities, encompassing 76 instances of reintroduced vulnerabilities. Our findings show that reintroductions often align with increased issue spoilage and fluctuating issue density, reflecting short-term inefficiencies in issue management and team responsiveness. These observations provide a foundation for broader studies that combine process and code metrics to predict risky fixes and strengthen software security.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 6 figures; Samiha Shimmi and Nicholas M.

Code review serves as an effective practice that enables developers to check their teammates' code before integration into the codebase. To streamline the generation of review comments, various automated code review approaches have been proposed, where LLM-based methods have significantly advanced the capabilities of automated review generation. However, existing models primarily focus on general-purpose code review, their effectiveness in identifying and addressing security-related issues remains underexplored. Moreover, adapting existing code review approaches to target security issues faces substantial challenges, including data scarcity and inadequate evaluation metrics. To address these limitations, we propose SecureReviewer, a new approach designed for enhancing LLMs' ability to identify and resolve security-related issues during code review. Specifically, we first construct a dataset tailored for training and evaluating secure code review capabilities. Leveraging this dataset, we fine-tune LLMs to generate code review comments that can effectively identify security issues and provide fix suggestions with our proposed secure-aware fine-tuning strategy. To mitigate hallucination in LLMs and enhance the reliability of their outputs, we integrate the RAG technique, which grounds the generated comments in domain-specific security knowledge. Additionally, we introduce SecureBLEU, a new evaluation metric designed to assess the effectiveness of review comments in addressing security issues. Experimental results demonstrate that SecureReviewer outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both security issue detection accuracy and the overall quality and practical utility of generated review comments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2026.

However, the degree to which coding LLMs complement each other and the best strategy for maximizing an ensemble's potential are unclear, leaving practitioners without a clear path to move beyond single-model systems. To address this gap, we empirically compare ten individual LLMs from five families, and three ensembles of these LLMs across three software engineering benchmarks covering code generation and program repair. We assess the complementarity between models and the performance gap between the best individual model and the ensembles. Next, we evaluate various selection heuristics to identify correct solutions from an ensemble's candidate pool. We find that the theoretical upperbound for an ensemble's performance can be 83% above the best single model. Our results show that consensus-based strategies for selecting solutions fall into a "popularity trap," amplifying common but incorrect outputs. In contrast, a diversity-based strategy realizes up to 95% of this theoretical potential, and proves effective even in small two-model ensembles, enabling a cost-efficient way to enhance performance by leveraging multiple LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Added...</summary><p>Added Acknowledgments section and hyphenated last names</p></details> |

However, the need for specialized expertise to write precise specifications, navigate complex proof obligations, and learn annotations often makes verification an order of magnitude more expensive than implementation. While modern AI systems can recognize patterns in mathematical proofs and interpret natural language, effectively integrating them into the formal verification process remains an open challenge. We present Prometheus, a novel AI-assisted system that facilitates automated code verification with current AI capabilities in conjunction with modular software engineering principles (e.g., modular refactoring). Our approach begins by decomposing complex program logic, such as nested loops, into smaller, verifiable components. Once verified, these components are recomposed to construct a proof of the original program. This decomposition-recomposition workflow is non-trivial. Prometheus addresses this by guiding the proof search through structured decomposition of complex lemmas into smaller, verifiable sub-lemmas. When automated tools are insufficient, users can provide lightweight natural language guidance to steer the proof process effectively. Our evaluation demonstrates that transiently applying modular restructuring to the code substantially improves the AI's effectiveness in verifying individual components. This approach successfully verifies 86% of tasks in our curated dataset, compared to 68% for the baseline. Gains are more pronounced with increasing specification complexity, improving from 30% to 69%, and when integrating proof outlines for complex programs, from 25% to 87%.</p></details> |  |

In particular, existing methods struggle to adapt to variable code rates or meet protocol compatibility requirements. This paper proposes a unified long short-term memory (LSTM)-based neural decoder for punctured convolutional and Turbo codes to address these challenges. The key component of the proposed LSTM-based neural decoder is puncturing-aware embedding, which integrates puncturing patterns directly into the neural network to enable seamless adaptation to different code rates. Moreover, a balanced bit error rate training strategy is designed to ensure the decoder's robustness across various code lengths, rates, and channels. In this way, the protocol compatibility requirement can be realized. Extensive simulations in both additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) and Rayleigh fading channels demonstrate that the proposed neural decoder outperforms conventional decoding techniques, offering significant improvements in decoding accuracy and robustness.</p></details> |  |

Prior work shows that repository history helps repair single-line bugs, since the last commit touching the buggy line is often the bug-introducing one. In this paper, we investigate whether repository history can also improve agentic APR systems at scale, especially for complex multi-hunk bugs. We present HAFixAgent, a History-Aware Bug-Fixing Agent that injects blame-derived repository heuristics into its repair loop. A preliminary study of all 854 real-world bugs from Defects4J motivates our design, showing that bug-relevant history is both widely available and highly concentrated. Empirical comparison of HAFixAgent with two state-of-the-art baselines shows: (1) Effectiveness: HAFixAgent significantly improves over the agent-based baseline (by 212.3%) and the multi-hunk baseline (by 29.9%). (2) Efficiency: history does not significantly increase agent steps and keeps token costs comparable, with notably lower median costs for complex multi-file-multi-hunk bugs. (3) Practicality: combining different historical heuristics repairs more bugs, offering a clear cost-benefit trade-off. HAFixAgent offers a practical recipe for history-aware agentic APR: ground the agent in version control history, prioritize diff-based historical context, and integrate complementary heuristics when needed.</p></details> | 31 pages, 6 figures |

Such 2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained (e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence of natural and artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Randomized Rounding over Dynamic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03490v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that under mild assumptions for a problem whose solutions admit a dynamic programming-like recurrence relation, we can still find a solution under additional packing constraints, which need to be satisfied approximately. The number of additional constraints can be very large, for example, polynomial in the problem size. Technically, we reinterpret the dynamic programming subproblems and their solutions as a network design problem. Inspired by techniques from, for example, the Directed Steiner Tree problem, we construct a strong LP relaxation, on which we then apply randomized rounding. Our approximation guarantees on the packing constraints have roughly the form of a $(n^{\epsilon} \mathrm{polylog}\ n)$-approximation in time $n^{O(1/\epsilon)}$, for any $\epsilon > 0$. By setting $\epsilon=\log \log n/\log n$, we obtain a polylogarithmic approximation in quasi-polynomial time, or by setting $\epsilon$ as a constant, an $n^\epsilon$-approximation in polynomial time. While there are necessary assumptions on the form of the DP, it is general enough to capture many textbook dynamic programs from Shortest Path to Longest Common Subsequence. Our algorithm then implies that we can impose additional constraints on the solutions to these problems. This allows us to model various problems from the literature in approximation algorithms, many of which were not thought to be connected to dynamic programming. In fact, our result can even be applied indirectly to some problems that involve covering instead of packing constraints, for example, the Directed Steiner Tree problem, or those that do not directly follow a recurrence relation, for example, variants of the Matching problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hesse's Redemption: Efficient Convex Polynomial Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03440v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient algorithms for convex optimization, such as the ellipsoid method, require an a priori bound on the radius of a ball around the origin guaranteed to contain an optimal solution if one exists. For linear and convex quadratic programming, such solution bounds follow from classical characterizations of optimal solutions by systems of linear equations. For other programs, e.g., semidefinite ones, examples due to Khachiyan show that optimal solutions may require huge coefficients with an exponential number of bits, even if we allow approximations. Correspondingly, semidefinite programming is not even known to be in NP. The unconstrained minimization of convex polynomials of degree four and higher has remained a fundamental open problem between these two extremes: its optimal solutions do not admit a linear characterization and, at the same time, Khachiyan-type examples do not apply. We resolve this problem by developing new techniques to prove solution bounds when no linear characterizations are available. Even for programs minimizing a convex polynomial (of arbitrary degree) over a polyhedron, we prove that the existence of an optimal solution implies that an approximately optimal one with polynomial bit length also exists. These solution bounds, combined with the ellipsoid method, yield the first polynomial-time algorithm for convex polynomial programming, settling a question posed by Nesterov (Math. Program., 2019). Before, no polynomial-time algorithm was known even for unconstrained minimization of a convex polynomial of degree four.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Boundary Control of Diffusion on Graphs via Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03129v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a linear programming (LP) framework for steady-state diffusion and flux optimization on geometric networks. The state variable satisfies a discrete diffusion law on a weighted, oriented graph, where conductances are scaled by edge lengths to preserve geometric fidelity. Boundary potentials act as controls that drive interior fluxes according to a linear network Laplacian. The optimization problem enforces physically meaningful sign and flux-cap constraints at all boundary edges, derived directly from a gradient bound. This yields a finite-dimensional LP whose feasible set is polyhedral, and whose boundedness and solvability follow from simple geometric or algebraic conditions on the network data. We prove that under the absence of negative recession directions--automatically satisfied in the presence of finite box bounds, flux caps, or sign restrictions--the LP admits a global minimizer. Several sufficient conditions guaranteeing boundedness of the feasible region are identified, covering both full-rank and rank-deficient flux maps. The analysis connects classical results such as the Minkowski--Weyl decomposition, Hoffman's bound, and the fundamental theorem of linear programming with modern network-based diffusion modeling. Two large-scale examples illustrate the framework: (i) A typical large stadium in a major modern city, which forms a single connected component with relatively uniform corridor widths, and a (ii) A complex street network emanating from a large, historical city center, which forms a multi-component system.</p></details> |  |

Generative AI (GenAI) coding assistants such as GitHub Copilot have been shown to improve developer productivity, but their impact on code understanding is less clear. We replicate and extend a previous study by exploring both performance and comprehension in GenAI-assisted brownfield programming tasks. In a within-subjects experimental study, 18 computer science graduate students completed feature implementation tasks with and without Copilot. Results show that Copilot significantly reduced task time and increased the number of test cases passed. However, comprehension scores did not differ across conditions, revealing a comprehension-performance gap: participants passed more test cases with Copilot, but did not demonstrate greater understanding of the legacy codebase. Moreover, we failed to find a correlation between comprehension and task performance. These findings suggest that while GenAI tools can accelerate programming progress in a legacy codebase, such progress may come without an improved understanding of that codebase. We consider the implications of these findings for programming education and GenAI tool design.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Program Synthesis Dialog Agents for Interactive Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19610v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world eligibility problems, ranging from medical diagnosis to tax planning, can be mapped to decision problems expressed in natural language, wherein a model must make a binary choice based on user features. Large-scale domains such as legal codes or frequently updated funding opportunities render human annotation (e.g., web forms or decision trees) impractical, highlighting the need for agents that can automatically assist in decision-making. Since relevant information is often only known to the user, it is crucial that these agents ask the right questions. As agents determine when to terminate a conversation, they face a trade-off between accuracy and the number of questions asked, a key metric for both user experience and cost. To evaluate this task, we propose BeNYfits, a new benchmark for determining user eligibility for multiple overlapping social benefits opportunities through interactive decision-making. Our experiments show that current language models struggle with frequent hallucinations, with GPT-4o scoring only 35.7 F1 using a ReAct-style chain-of-thought. To address this, we introduce ProADA, a novel approach that leverages program synthesis to assist in decision-making by mapping dialog planning to a code generation problem and using gaps in structured data to determine the best next action. Our agent, ProADA, improves the F1 score to 55.6 while maintaining nearly the same number of dialog turns.</p></details> |  |

This work compares three bitstring implementations in C++: std::bitset, boost::dynamic_bitset, and a custom direct implementation. Their performance is benchmarked in the context of concatenation within a Linear Genetic Programming system. Benchmarks were conducted on three platforms (macOS, Linux, and Windows MSYS2) to assess platform specific performance variations. The results show that the custom direct implementation delivers the fastest performance on Linux and Windows, while std::bitset performs best on macOS. Although consistently slower, boost::dynamic_bitset remains a viable and flexible option. These findings highlight the influence of compiler optimisations and system architecture on performance, providing practical guidance for selecting the optimal method based on platform and application requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Application of the Lovász-Schrijver Lift-and-Project Operator to Compact Stable Set Integer Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19290v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Lov\'asz theta function $\theta(G)$ provides a very good upper bound on the stability number of a graph $G$. It can be computed in polynomial time by solving a semidefinite program (SDP), which also turns out to be fairly tractable in practice. Consequently, $\theta(G)$ achieves a hard-to-beat trade-off between computational effort and strength of the bound. Indeed, several attempts to improve the theta bound are documented, mainly based on playing around the application of the $N_+(\cdot)$ lifting operator of Lov\'asz and Schrijver to the classical formulation of the maximum stable set problem. Experience shows that solving such SDP-s often struggles against practical intractability and requires highly specialized methods. We investigate the application of such an operator to two different linear formulations based on clique and nodal inequalities, respectively. Fewer inequalities describe these two and yet guarantee that the resulting SDP bound is at least as strong as $\theta(G)$. Our computational experience, including larger graphs than those previously documented, shows that upper bounds stronger than $\theta(G)$ can be accessed by a reasonable additional effort using the clique-based formulation on sparse graphs and the nodal-based one on dense graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Graph Similarity Search through Integer Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02611v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Graph Edit Distance (GED) is an important metric for measuring the similarity between two (labeled) graphs. It is defined as the minimum cost required to convert one graph into another through a series of (elementary) edit operations. Its effectiveness in assessing the similarity of large graphs is limited by the complexity of its exact calculation, which is NP-hard theoretically and computationally challenging in practice. The latter can be mitigated by switching to the Graph Similarity Search under GED constraints, which determines whether the edit distance between two graphs is below a given threshold. A popular framework for solving Graph Similarity Search under GED constraints in a graph database for a query graph is the filter-and-verification framework. Filtering discards unpromising graphs, while the verification step certifies the similarity between the filtered graphs and the query graph. To improve the filtering step, we define a lower bound based on an integer linear programming formulation. We prove that this lower bound dominates the effective branch match-based lower bound and can also be computed efficiently. Consequently, we propose a graph similarity search algorithm that uses a hierarchy of lower bound algorithms and solves a novel integer programming formulation that exploits the threshold parameter. An extensive computational experience on a well-assessed test bed shows that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm on most of the examined thresholds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chance-Constrained Neural MPC under Uncontrollable Agents via Sequential Convex Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03293v2)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work investigates the challenge of ensuring safety guarantees under uncontrollable agents whose behaviors are stochastic and depend on both their own and the system's states. We present a neural model predictive control (MPC) framework that predicts the trajectory of the uncontrollable agent using a predictor learned from offline data. To provide probabilistic guarantees on prediction errors, we employ split conformal prediction to construct region-specific, time-dependent uncertainty bounds, which are integrated into the MPC formulation. To solve the resulting non-convex, discontinuous optimization problem, we propose a two-loop iterative sequential convex programming algorithm. The inner loop solves convexified subproblems with fixed error bounds, while the outer loop refines these bounds based on updated control sequences. We establish convergence guarantees under mild regularity conditions and demonstrate the optimality of the algorithm. We illustrate our method with an autonomous driving scenario involving interactive pedestrians. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach achieves superior safety and efficiency compared to baseline methods, with success rates exceeding 99.5\% while maintaining higher average speeds in multi-pedestrian scenarios.</p></details> |  |

The critical seed chaining step must connect exact k-mer matches between reads and reference genomes while filtering spurious matches, yet state-of-the-art methods rely on fixed gap penalty functions unable to adapt to varying genomic contexts including tandem repeats and structural variants. This paper presents RawHash3, a hybrid framework combining graph neural networks with classical dynamic programming for adaptive seed chaining that maintains real-time performance while providing statistical guarantees. We formalize seed chaining as graph learning where seeds constitute nodes with 12-dimensional feature vectors and edges encode 8-dimensional spatial relationships including gap consistency. Our architecture employs three-layer EdgeConv GNN with confidence-based method selection that dynamically switches between learned guidance and algorithmic fallback. Comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 synthetic nanopore reads with 5,200 test seeds demonstrates RawHash3 achieves 99.94 percent precision and 40.07 percent recall, representing statistically significant 25.0 percent relative improvement over baseline with p less than 0.001. The system maintains median inference latency of 1.59ms meeting real-time constraints, while demonstrating superior robustness with 100 percent success rate under 20 percent label corruption versus baseline degradation to 30.3 percent. Cross-validation confirms stability establishing graph neural networks as viable approach for production genomics pipelines.</p></details> | <details><summary>31 pa...</summary><p>31 pages, 12 figures, 6 tables.

We propose a low-cost visual program distillation method that can be used for models with at most 1 billion parameters and requires no human-generated program annotations. We achieve this through synthetic data augmentation based on decoupling programs into higher-level skills, called templates, and their corresponding arguments. Experimental results show that, with a relatively small amount of question/answer data, small language models can generate high-quality specialized visual programs with the added benefit of much faster inference</p></details> | EMNLP Camera Ready |
| **[Disciplined Biconvex Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01813v1)** | 2025-11-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce disciplined biconvex programming (DBCP), a modeling framework for specifying and solving biconvex optimization problems. Biconvex optimization problems arise in various applications, including machine learning, signal processing, computational science, and control. Solving a biconvex optimization problem in practice usually resolves to heuristic methods based on alternate convex search (ACS), which iteratively optimizes over one block of variables while keeping the other fixed, so that the resulting subproblems are convex and can be efficiently solved. However, designing and implementing an ACS solver for a specific biconvex optimization problem usually requires significant effort from the user, which can be tedious and error-prone. DBCP extends the principles of disciplined convex programming to biconvex problems, allowing users to specify biconvex optimization problems in a natural way based on a small number of syntax rules. The resulting problem can then be automatically split and transformed into convex subproblems, for which a customized ACS solver is then generated and applied. DBCP allows users to quickly experiment with different biconvex problem formulations, without expertise in convex optimization. We implement DBCP into the open source Python package dbcp, as an extension to the famous domain specific language CVXPY for convex optimization.</p></details> |  |

CFP is an intuitionistic first-order logic with inductive and coinductive definitions extended by two propositional operators: Restriction (binary), a strengthening of implication, and a unary operator for total concurrency. The source of the extraction are formal CFP proofs, the target is a lambda calculus with constructors and recursion extended by a constructor Amb (for McCarthy's amb) which is interpreted operationally as globally angelic choice and is used to implement nondeterminism and concurrency. The correctness of extracted programs is proven via an intermediate domain-theoretic denotational semantics. We demonstrate the usefulness of our system by extracting a nondeterministic program that translates infinite Gray code into the signed digit representation. A noteworthy feature of CFP is the fact that the proof rules for restriction and concurrency involve variants of the classical law of excluded middle that would not be interpretable computationally without Amb.This is a revised and extended version of the conference paper presented at ESOP 2022 with the same title that contains full proofs of all major results.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages + 4 pages appendix. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2104.14669</p></details> |

Conditional literals are one such construct. They form "subformulas" that behave as nested implications within the bodies of logic rules. Their inclusion brings the form of rules closer to the less restrictive syntax of first-order logic. These qualities make conditional literals useful tools for knowledge representation. In this paper, we propose a semantics for logic programs with conditional literals and arithmetic based on the SM operator. These semantics do not require grounding, unlike the established semantics for such programs that relies on a translation to infinitary propositional logic. The main result of this paper establishes the precise correspondence between the proposed and existing semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version corrects the review of tau for negated atoms, and clarifies the distinction between global and local variables in conditional literals (the supporting proofs are also updated accordingly)</p></details> |

As a result, a mutation-alone $(1+\lambda)$ evolutionary strategy has become the canonical approach for CGP. Although several operators have been developed that demonstrate an increased performance over the canonical method, a general solution to the problem is still lacking. In this paper, we compare basic crossover methods, namely one-point and uniform, to variants in which nodes are ``preserved,'' including the subgraph crossover developed by Roman Kalkreuth, the difference being that when ``node preservation'' is active, crossover is not allowed to break apart instructions. We also compare a node mutation operator to the traditional point mutation; the former simply replaces an entire node with a new one. We find that node preservation in both mutation and crossover improves search using symbolic regression benchmark problems, moving the field towards a general solution to CGP crossover.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft to cite in another paper before both papers are peer-reviewed for the evo*2026 conference, 21 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

To aid debugging, program reduction techniques try to produce a smaller variant of the input program that still triggers the bug. However, existing execution-unaware program reduction techniques struggle with large and complex Wasm programs, because they rely on static information and apply syntactic transformations, while ignoring the valuable information offered by the input program's execution behavior. We present RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce, novel execution-aware program reduction techniques that leverage execution behaviors via record and replay. RR-Reduce identifies a bug-triggering function as the target function, isolates that function from the rest of the program, and generates a reduced program that replays only the interactions between the target function and the rest of the program. Hybrid-Reduce combines a complementary execution-unaware reduction technique with RR-Reduce to further reduce program size. We evaluate RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce on 28 Wasm programs that trigger a diverse set of bugs in three engines. On average, RR-Reduce reduces the programs to 1.20 percent of their original size in 14.5 minutes, which outperforms the state of the art by 33.15 times in terms of reduction time. Hybrid-Reduce reduces the programs to 0.13 percent of their original size in 3.5 hours, which outperforms the state of the art by 3.42 times in terms of reduced program size and 2.26 times in terms of reduction time. We envision RR-Reduce as the go-to tool for rapid, on-demand debugging in minutes, and Hybrid-Reduce for scenarios where developers require the smallest possible programs.</p></details> | Accepted at ASE 2025 |

This dissertation optimizes human-AI programming roles through self-determination theory and personality psychology, introducing the Role Optimization Motivation Alignment (ROMA) framework. Through Design Science Research spanning five cycles, this work establishes empirically-validated connections between personality traits, programming role preferences, and collaborative outcomes, engaging 200 experimental participants and 46 interview respondents. Key findings demonstrate that personality-driven role optimization significantly enhances self-determination and team dynamics, yielding 23% average motivation increases among professionals and up to 65% among undergraduates. Five distinct personality archetypes emerge: The Explorer (high Openness/low Agreeableness), The Orchestrator (high Extraversion/Agreeableness), The Craftsperson (high Neuroticism/low Extraversion), The Architect (high Conscientiousness), and The Adapter (balanced profile). Each exhibits distinct preferences for programming roles (Co-Pilot, Co-Navigator, Agent), with assignment modes proving crucial for satisfaction. The dissertation contributes: (1) an empirically-validated framework linking personality traits to role preferences and self-determination outcomes; (2) a taxonomy of AI collaboration modalities mapped to personality profiles while preserving human agency; and (3) an ISO/IEC 29110 extension enabling Very Small Entities to implement personality-driven role optimization within established standards.

| **[Differentiation Through Black-Box Quadratic Programming Solvers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06324v4)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable optimization has attracted significant research interest, particularly for quadratic programming (QP). Existing approaches for differentiating the solution of a QP with respect to its defining parameters often rely on specific integrated solvers. This integration limits their applicability, including their use in neural network architectures and bi-level optimization tasks, restricting users to a narrow selection of solver choices. To address this limitation, we introduce dQP, a modular and solver-agnostic framework for plug-and-play differentiation of virtually any QP solver. A key insight we leverage to achieve modularity is that, once the active set of inequality constraints is known, both the solution and its derivative can be expressed using simplified linear systems that share the same matrix. This formulation fully decouples the computation of the QP solution from its differentiation. Building on this result, we provide a minimal-overhead, open-source implementation ( https://github.com/cwmagoon/dQP ) that seamlessly integrates with over 15 state-of-the-art solvers. Comprehensive benchmark experiments demonstrate dQP's robustness and scalability, particularly highlighting its advantages in large-scale sparse problems.</p></details> |  |

Several state-of-the-art heuristics, including Feasibility Pump, Feasibility Jump, and Fix-and-Propagate, are further accelerated and enhanced.

We propose to prove satisfiability by building a tree automaton recognizing the Herbrand model of the CHCs. If such an automaton exists then the model is said to be regular, i.e., the Herbrand model is a regular set of atoms. Kostyukov et al. have shown how to derive an automaton when CVC4 finds a finite model of the CHCs. We propose an alternative way to build the automaton using an encoding into a SAT problem using Clingo, an Answer Set Programming (ASP) tool. We implemented a translation of CHCs with ADTs into an ASP problem. Combined with Clingo, we obtain a semi-complete satisfiability checker: it finds a tree automaton if a regular Herbrand model exists or finds a counter-example if the problem is unsatisfiable.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings HCVS 2025, arXiv:2510.25468</p></details> |

Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student thinking or learning needs. Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities: automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance. In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks, the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on 1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling, allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates. By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Runtime Repeated Recursion Unfolding in CHR: A Just-In-Time Online Program Optimization Strategy That Can Achieve Super-Linear Speedup](http://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02180v5)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a just-in-time runtime program transformation strategy based on repeated recursion unfolding. Our online program optimization generates several versions of a recursion differentiated by the minimal number of recursive steps covered. The base case of the recursion is ignored in our technique. Our method is introduced here on the basis of single linear direct recursive rules. When a recursive call is encountered at runtime, first an unfolder creates specializations of the associated recursive rule on-the-fly and then an interpreter applies these rules to the call. Our approach reduces the number of recursive rule applications to its logarithm at the expense of introducing a logarithmic number of generic unfolded rules. We prove correctness of our online optimization technique and determine its time complexity. For recursions which have enough simplifyable unfoldings, a super-linear is possible, i.e. speedup by more than a constant factor. The necessary simplification is problem-specific and has to be provided at compile-time. In our speedup analysis, we prove a sufficient condition as well as a sufficient and necessary condition for super-linear speedup relating the complexity of the recursive steps of the original rule and the unfolded rules. We have implemented an unfolder and meta-interpreter for runtime repeated recursion unfolding with just five rules in Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) embedded in Prolog. We illustrate the feasibility of our approach with simplifications, time complexity results and benchmarks for some basic tractable algorithms. The simplifications require some insight and were derived manually. The runtime improvement quickly reaches several orders of magnitude, consistent with the super-linear speedup predicted by our theorems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final version as accepted for Journal Fundamenta Informaticae</p></details> |

A graph neural network-based model is designed to generate projections tailored to each QP instance, enabling us to produce high-quality solutions even for previously unseen problems. The model is trained on heterogeneous QPs to minimize the expected objective value evaluated on the projected solutions. This is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem; the inner optimization solves the QP under a given projection using a QP solver, while the outer optimization updates the model parameters. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve this bilevel optimization problem, which computes parameter gradients without backpropagating through the solver. We provide a theoretical analysis of the generalization ability of solving QPs with projection matrices generated by neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces high-quality feasible solutions with reduced computation time, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable Programming for Differential Equations: A Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09699v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The differentiable programming paradigm is a cornerstone of modern scientific computing. It refers to numerical methods for computing the gradient of a numerical model's output. Many scientific models are based on differential equations, where differentiable programming plays a crucial role in calculating model sensitivities, inverting model parameters, and training hybrid models that combine differential equations with data-driven approaches. Furthermore, recognizing the strong synergies between inverse methods and machine learning offers the opportunity to establish a coherent framework applicable to both fields. Differentiating functions based on the numerical solution of differential equations is non-trivial. Numerous methods based on a wide variety of paradigms have been proposed in the literature, each with pros and cons specific to the type of problem investigated. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques to compute derivatives of numerical solutions of differential equations. We first discuss the importance of gradients of solutions of differential equations in a variety of scientific domains. Second, we lay out the mathematical foundations of the various approaches and compare them with each other. Third, we cover the computational considerations and explore the solutions available in modern scientific software. Last but not least, we provide best-practices and recommendations for practitioners. We hope that this work accelerates the fusion of scientific models and data, and fosters a modern approach to scientific modelling.</p></details> |  |

First, we show that there is no distributed quantum advantage for any linear program. Put otherwise, if there is a quantum-LOCAL algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ that finds an $\alpha$-approximation of some linear optimization problem $\Pi$ in $T$ communication rounds, we can construct a classical, deterministic LOCAL algorithm $\mathcal{A}'$ that finds an $\alpha$-approximation of $\Pi$ in $T$ rounds. As a corollary, all classical lower bounds for linear programs, including the KMW bound, hold verbatim in quantum-LOCAL. Second, using the above result, we show that there exists a locally checkable labeling problem (LCL) for which quantum-LOCAL is strictly weaker than the classical deterministic SLOCAL model. Our results extend from quantum-LOCAL also to finitely dependent and non-signaling distributions, and one of the corollaries of our work is that the non-signaling model and the SLOCAL model are incomparable in the context of LCL problems: By prior work, there exists an LCL problem for which SLOCAL is strictly weaker than the non-signaling model, and our work provides a separation in the opposite direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DISC 2025</p></details> |

However, the varied capabilities of these tools across model versions and the mixed availability of extensions that enable web search, code execution, or retrieval-augmented generation create opportunities for user misconceptions about what systems can and cannot do. Such misconceptions may lead to over-reliance, unproductive practices, or insufficient quality control in LLM-assisted programming. Here, we aim to characterize misconceptions that users of conversational LLM-based assistants may have in programming contexts. Using a two-phase approach, we first brainstorm and catalog user misconceptions that may occur, and then conduct a qualitative analysis to examine whether these conceptual issues surface in naturalistic Python-programming conversations with an LLM-based chatbot drawn from an openly available dataset. Indeed, we see evidence that some users have misplaced expectations about the availability of LLM-based chatbot features like web access, code execution, or non-text output generation. We also see potential evidence for deeper conceptual issues around the scope of information required to debug, validate, and optimize programs. Our findings reinforce the need for designing LLM-based tools that more clearly communicate their programming capabilities to users.</p></details> |  |

In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming, introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through irrelevant inferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

Pair programming often involves heavy knowledge transfer from mainly one partner to the other. Objective: Understand how to fill the ensuing Teacher and Student roles well (positive behavioral patterns). Understand how they may break (anti-patterns). Method: Open coding and axial coding of 17 recorded pair programming sessions with 18 developers from 5 German software companies, plus interviews with 6 different developers from 4 other German companies. Results: We describe six facets of effective Teacher behavior (e.g. Prioritizing Knowledge Transfer) and two facets of effective Student behavior (e.g. Expressing Knowledge Wants). We describe four harmful would-be-Teacher behaviors (e.g. Pushing Unwanted Knowledge), and one harmful would-be-Student behavior (Failing to Provide a Back Channel). Conclusions: The role facets can serve as learning goals and to-do list for developers who want to develop strong pair programming skill. The anti-patterns can serve as warnings for one's own general behavior and as triggers for immediate meta-discussion if they occur within a pairing session.</p></details> |  |
| **[Serve Programs, Not Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25412v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current large language model (LLM) serving systems, primarily designed for text completion, are neither efficient nor adaptable for increasingly complex LLM applications due to their inflexible design. We propose a new LLM serving system architecture that serves programs instead of prompts to address this problem. These programs, called LLM Inference Programs (LIPs), allow users to customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime and to offload parts of their application logic, such as tool execution, to the server. We describe an example of this architecture through a system named Symphony, which functions as an operating system for LIPs. Symphony exposes LLM model computations via system calls and virtualizes KV cache with a dedicated file system, while ensuring GPU efficiency with a two-level process scheduling scheme. Symphony has the potential to open the door to a more efficient and extensible ecosystem for LLM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>HotOS...</summary><p>HotOS 2025.

Current research typically endeavors to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL baseline, which is resource-intensive.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Formal Verification of Quantum Error Correcting Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07732v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum error correction (QEC) is fundamental for suppressing noise in quantum hardware and enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation. In this paper, we propose an efficient verification framework for QEC programs. We define an assertion logic and a program logic specifically crafted for QEC programs and establish a sound proof system. We then develop an efficient method for handling verification conditions (VCs) of QEC programs: for Pauli errors, the VCs are reduced to classical assertions that can be solved by SMT solvers, and for non-Pauli errors, we provide a heuristic algorithm. We formalize the proposed program logic in Coq proof assistant, making it a verified QEC verifier. Additionally, we implement an automated QEC verifier, Veri-QEC, for verifying various fault-tolerant scenarios. We demonstrate the efficiency and broad functionality of the framework by performing different verification tasks across various scenarios. Finally, we present a benchmark of 14 verified stabilizer codes.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables; v2: Extended version of the paper in PLDI 2025; Evaluated artifact at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15267327 v3: revise typos and inconsistencies</p></details> |

However, developers often identify specification violations only during testing, as error messages typically lack the detail necessary for effective diagnosis. Consequently, debugging requires trial and error. This study proposes dcFix, a method for detecting and automatically repairing REST API misuses in client programs. In particular, dcFix identifies non-conforming code fragments, integrates them with the relevant API specifications into prompts, and leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce the corrected code. Our evaluation demonstrates that dcFix accurately detects misuse and outperforms the baseline approach, in which prompts to the LLM omit any indication of code fragments non conforming to REST API specifications.</p></details> |  |

We model the execution space of a concurrent program as a branched topological space, where program states are points and state transitions are paths. Within this framework, we characterize deadlocks as attractors and livelocks as non-contractible loops in the execution space. By employing tools from algebraic topology, particularly homotopy and homology groups, we define a series of concurrent topological invariants to systematically detect and classify these concurrent "singularities" without exhaustively traversing all states. This work aims to establish a geometric and topological foundation for concurrent program verification, transcending the limitations of traditional model checking.</p></details> | 10 pages |

It achieves fault detection and correction at runtime by adding diverse redundancy into programs, minimizing fault mode overlap between redundant program variants. In this work, we propose the automated generation of program variants using large language models. We design, develop and evaluate Gal\'apagos: a tool for generating program variants using LLMs, validating their correctness and equivalence, and using them to assemble N-Version binaries. We evaluate Gal\'apagos by creating N-Version components of real-world C code. Our original results show that Gal\'apagos can produce program variants that are proven to be functionally equivalent, even when the variants are written in a different programming language. Our systematic diversity measurement indicates that functionally equivalent variants produced by Gal\'apagos, are statically different after compilation, and present diverging internal behavior at runtime. We demonstrate that the variants produced by Gal\'apagos can protect C code against real miscompilation bugs which affect the Clang compiler. Overall, our paper shows that producing N-Version software can be drastically automated by advanced usage of practical formal verification and generative language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Heuristics with Large Language Models (LLMs) for Mixed-Integer Programs: Single-Machine Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24013v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our study contributes to the scheduling and combinatorial optimization literature with new heuristics discovered by leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). We focus on the single-machine total tardiness (SMTT) problem, which aims to minimize total tardiness by sequencing n jobs on a single processor without preemption, given processing times and due dates. We develop and benchmark two novel LLM-discovered heuristics, the EDD Challenger (EDDC) and MDD Challenger (MDDC), inspired by the well-known Earliest Due Date (EDD) and Modified Due Date (MDD) rules. In contrast to prior studies that employed simpler rule-based heuristics, we evaluate our LLM-discovered algorithms using rigorous criteria, including optimality gaps and solution time derived from a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of SMTT. We compare their performance against state-of-the-art heuristics and exact methods across various job sizes (20, 100, 200, and 500 jobs). For instances with more than 100 jobs, exact methods such as MIP and dynamic programming become computationally intractable. Up to 500 jobs, EDDC improves upon the classic EDD rule and another widely used algorithm in the literature. MDDC consistently outperforms traditional heuristics and remains competitive with exact approaches, particularly on larger and more complex instances. This study shows that human-LLM collaboration can produce scalable, high-performing heuristics for NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization, even under limited resources when effectively configured.</p></details> |  |
| **[Program Evaluation with Remotely Sensed Outcomes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10959v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Economists often estimate treatment effects in experiments using remotely sensed variables (RSVs), e.g., satellite images or mobile phone activity, in place of directly measured economic outcomes. A common practice is to use an observational sample to train a predictor of the economic outcome from the RSV, and then use these predictions as the outcomes in the experiment. We show that this method is biased whenever the RSV is a post-outcome variable, meaning that variation in the economic outcome causes variation in the RSV. For example, changes in poverty or environmental quality cause changes in satellite images, but not vice versa. As our main result, we nonparametrically identify the treatment effect by formalizing the intuition underlying common practice: the conditional distribution of the RSV given the outcome and treatment is stable across samples. Our identifying formula reveals that efficient inference requires predictions of three quantities from the RSV -- the outcome, treatment, and sample indicator -- whereas common practice only predicts the outcome. Valid inference does not require any rate conditions on RSV predictions, justifying the use of complex deep learning algorithms with unknown statistical properties. We reanalyze the effect of an anti-poverty program in India using satellite images.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving Random Hyperbolic Conservation Laws Using Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10104v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A novel structure-preserving numerical method to solve random hyperbolic systems of conservation laws is presented. The method uses a concept of generalized, measure-valued solutions to random conservation laws. This yields a linear partial differential equation with respect to the Young measure and allows to compute the approximation based on linear programming problems. We analyze structure-preserving properties of the derived numerical method and discuss its advantages and disadvantages. We numerically demonstrate the approach on the one-dimensional Burgers and isentropic Euler equations and compare with stochastic collocation. In addition, we introduce a discontinuous-flux test in which different entropies used in the linear-program objective select different weak entropy solutions, and we report the corresponding changes in the moments and supports of the Young measure.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Neural Network Framework for Discovering Closed-form Solutions to Quadratic Programs with Linear Constraints](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23737v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used to model complex optimization problems in many applications, yet have difficulty guaranteeing solution optimality and feasibility, despite training on large datasets. Training a NN as a surrogate optimization solver amounts to estimating a global solution function that maps varying problem input parameters to the corresponding optimal solutions. Work in multiparametric programming (mp) has shown that solutions to quadratic programs (QP) are piece-wise linear functions of the parameters, and researchers have suggested leveraging this property to model mp-QP using NN with ReLU activation functions, which also exhibit piecewise linear behaviour. This paper proposes a NN modeling approach and learning algorithm that discovers the exact closed-form solution to QP with linear constraints, by analytically deriving NN model parameters directly from the problem coefficients without training. Whereas generic DNN cannot guarantee accuracy outside the training distribution, the closed-form NN model produces exact solutions for every discovered critical region of the solution function. To evaluate the closed-form NN model, it was applied to DC optimal power flow problems in electricity management. In terms of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality and feasibility of solutions, it outperformed a classically trained DNN and was competitive with, or outperformed, a commercial analytic solver (Gurobi) at far less computational cost. For a long-range energy planning problem, it was able to produce optimal and feasible solutions for millions of input parameters within seconds.</p></details> | 21 pages |

This novel algorithm can be viewed as an extension and generalization of the DBDP2 scheme and a dynamic programming version of the forward-backward algorithm proposed recently for high-dimensional semilinear PDEs and semilinear PIDEs, respectively. Different from the DBDP2 scheme for semilinear PDEs, our algorithm approximate simultaneously the solution and the integral kernel by deep neural networks, while the gradient of the solution is approximated by numerical differential techniques. The related error estimates for the integral kernel approximation play key roles in deriving error estimates for the novel algorithm. Numerical experiments confirm our theoretical results and verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Once Upon an Input: Reasoning via Per-Instance Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22849v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) excel at zero-shot inference but continue to struggle with complex, multi-step reasoning. Recent methods that augment LLMs with intermediate reasoning steps such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Program of Thought (PoT) improve performance but often produce undesirable solutions, especially in algorithmic domains. We introduce Per-Instance Program Synthesis (PIPS), a method that generates and refines programs at the instance-level using structural feedback without relying on task-specific guidance or explicit test cases. To further improve performance, PIPS incorporates a confidence metric that dynamically chooses between direct inference and program synthesis on a per-instance basis. Experiments across three frontier LLMs and 30 benchmarks including all tasks of Big Bench Extra Hard (BBEH), visual question answering tasks, relational reasoning tasks, and mathematical reasoning tasks show that PIPS improves the absolute harmonic mean accuracy by up to 8.6% and 9.4% compared to PoT and CoT respectively, and reduces undesirable program generations by 65.1% on the algorithmic tasks compared to PoT with Gemini-2.0-Flash.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025. 34 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |
| **[PIP-LLM: Integrating PDDL-Integer Programming with LLMs for Coordinating Multi-Robot Teams Using Natural Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22784v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Enabling robot teams to execute natural language commands requires translating high-level instructions into feasible, efficient multi-robot plans. While Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with Planning Domain Description Language (PDDL) offer promise for single-robot scenarios, existing approaches struggle with multi-robot coordination due to brittle task decomposition, poor scalability, and low coordination efficiency. We introduce PIP-LLM, a language-based coordination framework that consists of PDDL-based team-level planning and Integer Programming (IP) based robot-level planning. PIP-LLMs first decomposes the command by translating the command into a team-level PDDL problem and solves it to obtain a team-level plan, abstracting away robot assignment. Each team-level action represents a subtask to be finished by the team. Next, this plan is translated into a dependency graph representing the subtasks' dependency structure. Such a dependency graph is then used to guide the robot-level planning, in which each subtask node will be formulated as an IP-based task allocation problem, explicitly optimizing travel costs and workload while respecting robot capabilities and user-defined constraints. This separation of planning from assignment allows PIP-LLM to avoid the pitfalls of syntax-based decomposition and scale to larger teams. Experiments across diverse tasks show that PIP-LLM improves plan success rate, reduces maximum and average travel costs, and achieves better load balancing compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[MIBP-Cert: Certified Training against Data Perturbations with Mixed-Integer Bilinear Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10186v2)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Data errors, corruptions, and poisoning attacks during training pose a major threat to the reliability of modern AI systems. While extensive effort has gone into empirical mitigations, the evolving nature of attacks and the complexity of data require a more principled, provable approach to robustly learn on such data - and to understand how perturbations influence the final model. Hence, we introduce MIBP-Cert, a novel certification method based on mixed-integer bilinear programming (MIBP) that computes sound, deterministic bounds to provide provable robustness even under complex threat models. By computing the set of parameters reachable through perturbed or manipulated data, we can predict all possible outcomes and guarantee robustness. To make solving this optimization problem tractable, we propose a novel relaxation scheme that bounds each training step without sacrificing soundness. We demonstrate the applicability of our approach to continuous and discrete data, as well as different threat models - including complex ones that were previously out of reach.</p></details> |  |
| **[SwiftSolve: A Self-Iterative, Complexity-Aware Multi-Agent Framework for Competitive Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22626v1)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Correctness alone is insufficient: LLM-generated programs frequently satisfy unit tests while violating contest time or memory budgets. We present SwiftSolve, a complexity-aware multi-agent system for competitive programming that couples algorithmic planning with empirical profiling and complexity-guided repair. We frame competitive programming as a software environment where specialized agents act as programmers, each assuming roles such as planning, coding, profiling, and complexity analysis. A Planner proposes an algorithmic sketch; a deterministic Static Pruner filters high-risk plans; a Coder emits ISO C++17; a Profiler compiles and executes candidates on a fixed input-size schedule to record wall time and peak memory; and a Complexity Analyst fits log-log growth (s, R2) with an LLM fallback to assign a complexity class and dispatch targeted patches to either the Planner or Coder. Agents communicate via typed, versioned JSON; a controller enforces iteration caps and diminishing returns stopping. Evaluated on 26 problems (16 BigO, 10 Codeforces Div. 2) in a POSIX sandbox (2 s / 256-512 MB), SwiftSolve attains pass@1 = 61.54% (16/26) on the first attempt and Solved@<=3 = 80.77% with marginal latency change (mean 11.96 s to 12.66 s per attempt). Aggregate run-level success is 73.08% at 12.40 s mean. Failures are predominantly resource-bound, indicating inefficiency rather than logic errors. Against Claude Opus 4, SwiftSolve improves run-level success (73.1% vs 52.6%) at approximately 2x runtime overhead (12.4 s vs 6.8 s). Beyond correctness (pass@k), we report efficiency metrics (eff@k for runtime and memory, incidence of TLE or MLE, and complexity fit accuracy on BigO), demonstrating that profiling and complexity-guided replanning reduce inefficiency while preserving accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Infinite-Width Limit of a Single Attention Layer: Analysis via Tensor Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.00846v2)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In modern theoretical analyses of neural networks, the infinite-width limit is often invoked to justify Gaussian approximations of neuron preactivations (e.g., via neural network Gaussian processes or Tensor Programs). However, these Gaussian-based asymptotic theories have so far been unable to capture the behavior of attention layers, except under special regimes such as infinitely many heads or tailored scaling schemes. In this paper, leveraging the Tensor Programs framework, we rigorously identify the infinite-width limit distribution of variables within a single attention layer under realistic architectural dimensionality and standard $1/\sqrt{n}$-scaling with $n$ dimensionality. We derive the exact form of this limit law without resorting to infinite-head approximations or tailored scalings, demonstrating that it departs fundamentally from Gaussianity. This limiting distribution exhibits non-Gaussianity from a hierarchical structure, being Gaussian conditional on the random similarity scores. Numerical experiments validate our theoretical predictions, confirming the effectiveness of our theory at finite width and accurate description of finite-head attentions. Beyond characterizing a standalone attention layer, our findings lay the groundwork for developing a unified theory of deep Transformer architectures in the infinite-width regime.</p></details> |  |
| **[CPRet: A Dataset, Benchmark, and Model for Retrieval in Competitive Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12925v2)** | 2025-10-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Competitive programming benchmarks are widely used in scenarios such as programming contests and large language model assessments. However, the growing presence of duplicate or highly similar problems raises concerns not only about competition fairness, but also about the validity of competitive programming as a benchmark for model evaluation. In this paper, we propose a new problem, similar question retrieval, to tackle this issue. Due to the lack of both data and models, solving this problem is challenging. To this end, we introduce CPRet, a retrieval-oriented benchmark suite for competitive programming, covering four retrieval tasks: two code-centric (i.e., Text-to-Code, Code-to-Code) and two newly proposed problem-centric tasks (i.e., Problem-to-Duplicate, Simplified-to-Full) built from a combination of automatically crawled problem-solution data and manually curated annotations. Our contribution includes both high-quality training data and temporally separated test sets for reliable evaluation. Besides, we further develop two task-specialized retrievers based on this dataset: CPRetriever-Code, trained with a novel Group-InfoNCE loss for problem-code alignment, and CPRetriever-Prob, fine-tuned for identifying problem-level similarity. Both models achieve strong results and are open-sourced for local use. Finally, we analyze LiveCodeBench and find that high-similarity problems inflate model pass rates and reduce differentiation, underscoring the need for similarity-aware evaluation in future benchmarks.

| **[Derivative-Free Sequential Quadratic Programming for Equality-Constrained Stochastic Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22458v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider solving nonlinear optimization problems with a stochastic objective and deterministic equality constraints, assuming that only zero-order information is available for both the objective and constraints, and that the objective is also subject to random sampling noise. Under this setting, we propose a Derivative-Free Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming (DF-SSQP) method. Due to the lack of derivative information, we adopt a simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation (SPSA) technique to randomly estimate the gradients and Hessians of both the objective and constraints. This approach requires only a dimension-independent number of zero-order evaluations -- as few as eight -- at each iteration step. A key distinction between our derivative-free and existing derivative-based SSQP methods lies in the intricate random bias introduced into the gradient and Hessian estimates of the objective and constraints, brought by stochastic zero-order approximations. To address this issue, we introduce an online debiasing technique based on momentum-style estimators that properly aggregate past gradient and Hessian estimates to reduce stochastic noise, while avoiding excessive memory costs via a moving averaging scheme. Under standard assumptions, we establish the global almost-sure convergence of the proposed DF-SSQP method. Notably, we further complement the global analysis with local convergence guarantees by demonstrating that the rescaled iterates exhibit asymptotic normality, with a limiting covariance matrix resembling the minimax optimal covariance achieved by derivative-based methods, albeit larger due to the absence of derivative information. Our local analysis enables online statistical inference of model parameters leveraging DF-SSQP. Numerical experiments on benchmark nonlinear problems demonstrate both the global and local behavior of DF-SSQP.</p></details> | 59 pages |
| **[On Integer Programs That Look Like Paths](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22430v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Solving integer programs of the form $\min \{\mathbf{x} \mid A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}, \mathbf{l} \leq \mathbf{x} \leq \mathbf{u}, \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{Z}^n \}$ is, in general, $\mathsf{NP}$-hard. Hence, great effort has been put into identifying subclasses of integer programs that are solvable in polynomial or $\mathsf{FPT}$ time. A common scheme for many of these integer programs is a star-like structure of the constraint matrix. The arguably simplest form that is not a star is a path. We study integer programs where the constraint matrix $A$ has such a path-like structure: every non-zero coefficient appears in at most two consecutive constraints. We prove that even if all coefficients of $A$ are bounded by 8, deciding the feasibility of such integer programs is $\mathsf{NP}$-hard via a reduction from 3-SAT. Given the existence of efficient algorithms for integer programs with star-like structures and a closely related pattern where the sum of absolute values is column-wise bounded by 2 (hence, there are at most two non-zero entries per column of size at most 2), this hardness result is surprising.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Cost of Certainty: Shot Budgets in Quantum Program Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22418v1)** | 2025-10-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As quantum computing advances toward early fault-tolerant machines, testing and verification of quantum programs become urgent but costly, since each execution consumes scarce hardware resources. Unlike in classical software testing, every measurement must be carefully budgeted. This paper develops a unified framework for reasoning about how many measurements are required to verify quantum programs. The goal is to connect theoretical error bounds with concrete test strategies and to extend the analysis from individual tests to full program-level verification. We analyze the relationship between error probability, fidelity, trace distance, and the quantum Chernoff bound to establish fundamental shot count limits. These foundations are applied to three representative testing methods: the inverse test, the swap test, and the chi-square test. Both idealized and noisy devices are considered. We also introduce a program-level budgeting approach that allocates verification effort across multiple subroutines. The inverse test is the most measurement efficient, the swap test requires about twice as many shots, and the chi-square test is easiest to implement but often needs orders of magnitude more measurements. In the presence of noise, calibrated baselines may increase measurement requirements beyond theoretical estimates. At the program level, distributing a global fidelity target across many fine-grained functions can cause verification costs to grow rapidly, whereas coarser decompositions or weighted allocations remain more practical. The framework clarifies trade-offs among different testing strategies, noise handling, and program decomposition. It provides practical guidance for budgeting measurement shots in quantum program testing, helping practitioners balance rigour against cost when designing verification strategies.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) have enabled solving large-scale non-private sparse regression - known as Best Subset Selection (BSS) - with millions of variables in minutes. However, extending these algorithmic advances to the setting of Differential Privacy (DP) has remained largely unexplored. In this paper, we introduce two new pure differentially private estimators for sparse variable selection, levering modern MIP techniques. Our framework is general and applies broadly to problems like sparse regression or classification, and we provide theoretical support recovery guarantees in the case of BSS. Inspired by the exponential mechanism, we develop structured sampling procedures that efficiently explore the non-convex objective landscape, avoiding the exhaustive combinatorial search in the exponential mechanism. We complement our theoretical findings with extensive numerical experiments, using both least squares and hinge loss for our objective function, and demonstrate that our methods achieve state-of-the-art empirical support recovery, outperforming competing algorithms in settings with up to $p=10^4$.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |

We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science, physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 154 coding tasks collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent, AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models. AlgoTuner uses a simple, budgeted loop that edits code, compiles and runs it, profiles performance, verifies correctness on tests, and selects the fastest valid version. AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers, which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Principled Data Augmentation for Learning to Solve Quadratic Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01728v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear and quadratic optimization are crucial in numerous real-world applications, ranging from training machine learning models to solving integer linear programs. Recently, learning-to-optimize methods (L2O) for linear (LPs) or quadratic programs (QPs) using message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) have gained traction, promising lightweight, data-driven proxies for solving such optimization problems. For example, they replace the costly computation of strong branching scores in branch-and-bound solvers, thereby reducing the need to solve many such optimization problems. However, robust L2O MPNNs remain challenging in data-scarce settings, especially when addressing complex optimization problems such as QPs. This work introduces a principled approach to data augmentation tailored for QPs via MPNNs. Our method leverages theoretically justified data augmentation techniques to generate diverse yet optimality-preserving instances. Furthermore, we integrate these augmentations into a self-supervised contrastive learning framework, thereby pretraining MPNNs for improved performance on L2O tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves generalization in supervised scenarios and facilitates effective transfer learning to related optimization problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 as spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Dependent Session Types for Verified Concurrent Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19129v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present TLLC which extends the Two-Level Linear dependent type theory (TLL) with session-based concurrency. Equipped with Martin-L\"{o}f style dependency, the session types of TLLC allow protocols to specify properties of communicated messages. When used in conjunction with the dependent type machinery already present in TLL, dependent session types facilitate a form of relational verification by relating concurrent programs with their idealized sequential counterparts. Correctness properties proven for sequential programs can be easily lifted to their corresponding concurrent implementations. TLLC makes session types a powerful tool for intrinsically verifying the correctness of data structures such as queues and concurrent algorithms such as map-reduce. To extend TLL with session types, we develop a novel formulation of intuitionistic session type which we believe to be widely applicable for integrating session types into other type systems beyond the context of TLLC. We study the meta-theory of our language, proving its soundness as both a term calculus and a process calculus. To demonstrate the practicality of TLLC, we have implemented a prototype compiler that translates TLLC programs into concurrent C code, which has been extensively evaluated.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Triage Taint Flows Reported by Dynamic Program Analysis in Node.js Packages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20739v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program analysis tools often produce large volumes of candidate vulnerability reports that require costly manual review, creating a practical challenge: how can security analysts prioritize the reports most likely to be true vulnerabilities? This paper investigates whether machine learning can be applied to prioritizing vulnerabilities reported by program analysis tools. We focus on Node.js packages and collect a benchmark of 1,883 Node.js packages, each containing one reported ACE or ACI vulnerability. We evaluate a variety of machine learning approaches, including classical models, graph neural networks (GNNs), large language models (LLMs), and hybrid models that combine GNN and LLMs, trained on data based on a dynamic program analysis tool's output. The top LLM achieves $F_{1} {=} 0.915$, while the best GNN and classical ML models reaching $F_{1} {=} 0.904$. At a less than 7% false-negative rate, the leading model eliminates 66.9% of benign packages from manual review, taking around 60 ms per package. If the best model is tuned to operate at a precision level of 0.8 (i.e., allowing 20% false positives amongst all warnings), our approach can detect 99.2% of exploitable taint flows while missing only 0.8%, demonstrating strong potential for real-world vulnerability triage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving 0-1 Integer Programs with Unknown Knapsack Constraints Using Membership Oracles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14090v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider solving a combinatorial optimization problem with unknown knapsack constraints using a membership oracle for each unknown constraint such that, given a solution, the oracle determines whether the constraint is satisfied or not with absolute certainty. The goal of the decision maker is to find the best possible solution subject to a budget on the number of oracle calls. Inspired by active learning for binary classification based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs), we devise a framework to solve the problem by learning and exploiting surrogate linear constraints. The framework includes training linear separators on the labeled points and selecting new points to be labeled, which is achieved by applying a sampling strategy and solving a 0-1 integer linear program. Following the active learning literature, a natural choice would be SVM as a linear classifier and the information-based sampling strategy known as simple margin, for each unknown constraint. We improve on both sides: we propose an alternative sampling strategy based on mixed-integer quadratic programming and a linear separation method inspired by an algorithm for convex optimization in the oracle model. We conduct experiments on classical problems and variants inspired by realistic applications to show how different linear separation methods and sampling strategies influence the quality of the results in terms of several metrics including objective value, dual bound and running time.</p></details> |  |

We formally describe an adaptation of the Lustre compilation scheme to the semantics of Mimosa and show how the coordination layer can be mapped to real-time operating system primitives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hybrid Mixed Integer Linear Programming for Large-Scale Join Order Optimisation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20308v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Finding optimal join orders is among the most crucial steps to be performed by query optimisers. Though extensively studied in data management research, the problem remains far from solved: While query optimisers rely on exhaustive search methods to determine ideal solutions for small problems, such methods reach their limits once queries grow in size. Yet, large queries become increasingly common in real-world scenarios, and require suitable methods to generate efficient execution plans. While a variety of heuristics have been proposed for large-scale query optimisation, they suffer from degrading solution quality as queries grow in size, or feature highly sub-optimal worst-case behavior, as we will show. We propose a novel method based on the paradigm of mixed integer linear programming (MILP): By deriving a novel MILP model capable of optimising arbitrary bushy tree structures, we address the limitations of existing MILP methods for join ordering, and can rely on highly optimised MILP solvers to derive efficient tree structures that elude competing methods. To ensure optimisation efficiency, we embed our MILP method into a hybrid framework, which applies MILP solvers precisely where they provide the greatest advantage over competitors, while relying on more efficient methods for less complex optimisation steps. Thereby, our approach gracefully scales to extremely large query sizes joining up to 100 relations, and consistently achieves the most robust plan quality among a large variety of competing join ordering methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Transparent Models, LLMs, and Practitioner-in-the-Loop: A Case of Nonprofit Program Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19799v1)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Public and nonprofit organizations often hesitate to adopt AI tools because most models are opaque even though standard approaches typically analyze aggregate patterns rather than offering actionable, case-level guidance. This study tests a practitioner-in-the-loop workflow that pairs transparent decision-tree models with large language models (LLMs) to improve predictive accuracy, interpretability, and the generation of practical insights. Using data from an ongoing college-success program, we build interpretable decision trees to surface key predictors. We then provide each tree's structure to an LLM, enabling it to reproduce case-level predictions grounded in the transparent models. Practitioners participate throughout feature engineering, model design, explanation review, and usability assessment, ensuring that field expertise informs the analysis at every stage. Results show that integrating transparent models, LLMs, and practitioner input yields accurate, trustworthy, and actionable case-level evaluations, offering a viable pathway for responsible AI adoption in the public and nonprofit sectors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Type-aware LLM-based Regression Test Generation for Python Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14000v2)** | 2025-10-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated regression test generation has been extensively explored, yet generating high-quality tests for Python programs remains particularly challenging. Because of the Python's dynamic typing features, existing approaches, ranging from search-based software testing (SBST) to recent LLM-driven techniques, are often prone to type errors. Hence, existing methods often generate invalid inputs and semantically inconsistent test cases, which ultimately undermine their practical effectiveness. To address these limitations, we present Test4Py, a novel framework that enhances type correctness in automated test generation for Python. Test4Py leverages the program's call graph to capture richer contextual information about parameters, and introduces a behavior-based type inference mechanism that accurately infers parameter types and construct valid test inputs. Beyond input construction, Test4Py integrates an iterative repair procedure that progressively refines generated test cases to improve coverage. In an evaluation on 183 real-world Python modules, Test4Py achieved an average statement coverage of 83.0% and branch coverage of 70.8%, outperforming state-of-the-art tools by 7.2% and 8.4%, respectively.</p></details> |  |
| **[Simulation-Guided Planning of a Target Trial Emulated Cluster Randomized Trial for Mass Small-Quantity Lipid Nutrient Supplementation Combined with Expanded Program on Immunization in Rural Niger](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19077v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While target trial emulation (TTE) is increasingly used to improve the analysis of non-randomized studies by applying trial design principles, TTE applications to emulate cluster randomized trials (RCTs) have been limited. We performed simulations to prospectively plan data collection of a non-randomized study intended to emulate a village-level cluster RCT when cluster-randomization was infeasible. The planned study will assess the impact of mass distribution of nutritional supplements embedded within an existing immunization program to improve pentavalent vaccination rates among children 12-24 months old in Niger. The design included covariate-constrained random selection of villages for outcome ascertainment at follow-up. Simulations used baseline census data on pentavalent vaccination rates and cluster-level covariates to compare the type I error rate and power of four statistical methods: beta-regression; quasi-binomial regression; inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW); and na\"ive Wald test. Of these methods, only IPTW and beta-regression controlled the type I error rate at 0.05, but IPTW yielded poor statistical power. Beta-regression, which showed adequate statistical power, was chosen as our primary analysis. Adopting simulation-guided design principles within TTE can enable robust planning of a group-level non-randomized study emulating a cluster RCT. Lessons from this study also apply to TTE planning of individually-RCTs.</p></details> |  |

Very recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), an increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed, facilitating software development and maintenance and demonstrating remarkable performance. However, due to ongoing explorations in the LLM-based APR field, it is challenging for researchers to understand the current achievements, challenges, and potential opportunities. This work provides the first systematic literature review to summarize the applications of LLMs in APR between 2020 and 2025. We analyze 189 relevant papers from LLMs, APR and their integration perspectives. First, we categorize existing popular LLMs that are applied to support APR and outline four types of utilization strategies for their deployment. Besides, we detail some specific repair scenarios that benefit from LLMs, e.g., semantic bugs and security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs into APR research, e.g., input forms and open science. Finally, we highlight a set of challenges remaining to be investigated and the potential guidelines for future research. Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to the APR community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of achievements and promote future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>update new papers, up to September 2025</p></details> |
| **[A Survey on Feedback Types in Automated Programming Assessment Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18923v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the recent rapid increase in digitization across all major industries, acquiring programming skills has increased the demand for introductory programming courses. This has further resulted in universities integrating programming courses into a wide range of curricula, including not only technical studies but also business and management fields of study. Consequently, additional resources are needed for teaching, grading, and tutoring students with diverse educational backgrounds and skills. As part of this, Automated Programming Assessment Systems (APASs) have emerged, providing scalable and high-quality assessment systems with efficient evaluation and instant feedback. Commonly, APASs heavily rely on predefined unit tests for generating feedback, often limiting the scope and level of detail of feedback that can be provided to students. With the rise of Large Language Models (LLMs) in recent years, new opportunities have emerged as these technologies can enhance feedback quality and personalization. To investigate how different feedback mechanisms in APASs are perceived by students, and how effective they are in supporting problem-solving, we have conducted a large-scale study with over 200 students from two different universities. Specifically, we compare baseline Compiler Feedback, standard Unit Test Feedback, and advanced LLM-based Feedback regarding perceived quality and impact on student performance. Results indicate that while students rate unit test feedback as the most helpful, AI-generated feedback leads to significantly better performances. These findings suggest combining unit tests and AI-driven guidance to optimize automated feedback mechanisms and improve learning outcomes in programming education.</p></details> |  |
| **[AlphaOPT: Formulating Optimization Programs with Self-Improving LLM Experience Library](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18428v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization modeling enables critical decisions across industries but remains difficult to automate: informal language must be mapped to precise mathematical formulations and executable solver code. Prior LLM approaches either rely on brittle prompting or costly retraining with limited generalization. We present AlphaOPT, a self-improving experience library that enables an LLM to learn from limited demonstrations (even answers alone, without gold-standard programs) and solver feedback - without annotated reasoning traces or parameter updates. AlphaOPT operates in a continual two-phase cycle: (i) a Library Learning phase that reflects on failed attempts, extracting solver-verified, structured insights as {taxonomy, condition, explanation, example}; and (ii) a Library Evolution phase that diagnoses retrieval misalignments and refines the applicability conditions of stored insights, improving transfer across tasks. This design (1) learns efficiently from limited demonstrations without curated rationales, (2) expands continually without costly retraining by updating the library rather than model weights, and (3) makes knowledge explicit and interpretable for human inspection and intervention. Experiments show that AlphaOPT steadily improves with more data (65% to 72% from 100 to 300 training items) and surpasses the strongest baseline by 7.7% on the out-of-distribution OptiBench dataset when trained only on answers. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/Minw913/AlphaOPT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Program Synthesis via Test-Time Transduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17393v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce transductive program synthesis, a new formulation of the program synthesis task that explicitly leverages test inputs during synthesis. While prior approaches to program synthesis--whether based on natural language descriptions or input-output examples--typically aim to generalize from training examples, they often struggle with robustness, especially in real-world settings where training examples are limited and test inputs involve various edge cases. To address this, we propose a novel framework that improves robustness by treating synthesis as an active learning over a finite hypothesis class defined by programs' outputs. We use an LLM to predict outputs for selected test inputs and eliminate inconsistent hypotheses, where the inputs are chosen via a greedy maximin algorithm to minimize the number of LLM queries required. We evaluate our approach on four benchmarks: Playgol, MBPP+, 1D-ARC, and programmatic world modeling on MiniGrid. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves program synthesis in both accuracy and efficiency. We release our code at https://github.com/klee972/SYNTRA.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Combinatorial Algorithm for Tropical Linearly Factorized Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07596v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tropical semiring is a set of numbers with addition "max" and multiplication "+". As well as in conventional algebra, linear programming problem in the tropical semiring has been developed. In this study, we introduce a new type of tropical optimization problem, namely, tropical linearly factorized programming problem. This problem involves minimizing the objective function given by the product of tropical linear forms divided by a tropical monomial, subject to tropical linear inequality constraints. The objective function is convex in the conventional sense but not in the tropical sense, while the feasible set is convex in the tropical sense but not in the conventional sense. Our algorithm for tropical linearly factorized programming is based on the descent method and exploits tangent digraphs. First, we demonstrate that the feasible descent direction at the current solution can be obtained by solving the minimum $s$-$t$ cut problem on a specific subgraph of the tangent digraph. Although exponentially many such digraphs may exist in general, a more efficient algorithm is devised in cases where the problem is non-degenerate. Focusing on the fact that tangent digraphs become spanning trees in non-degenerate cases, we present a simplex-like algorithm that updates the tree structure iteratively. We show that each iteration can be executed in $O(r_A+r_C)$ time, where $r_A$ and $r_C$ are the numbers of ``non-zero'' coefficients in the linear constraints and objective function, respectively. For integer instances, our algorithm finds a local optimum in $O((m+n)(r_A+r_C)MD)$ time, where $n$ and $m$ are the number of decision variables and constraints, respectively, $M$ is the maximum absolute value of coefficients and $D$ is the degree of the objective function.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Program Semantics Reasoning with Type Inference in System F](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23686v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into the software engineering ecosystem. Their test-time compute (TTC) reasoning capabilities show significant potential for understanding program logic and semantics beyond mere token recognition. However, current benchmarks for code reasoning lack a formal, program-centric deductive framework to ensure sound evaluation, and are incapable of assessing whether models genuinely reason about program semantics or merely exploit superficial associations between natural language and code tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce TF-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM reasoning based on type inference in System F, a task we refer to as program semantics reasoning. By employing verified transformations to remove semantically irrelevant natural language, we construct TF-Bench_pure, a purely semantics-driven variant of TF-Bench. Our analysis reveals substantial limitations in state-of-the-art LLMs, with the best-performing LLM (Claude-3.7-sonnet) achieving only 55.85% accuracy on TF-Bench_pure. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics to assess robustness and the effectiveness of test-time reasoning, underscoring critical limitations in current LLM capabilities and highlighting essential directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS '25, package released at: https://github.com/SecurityLab-UCD/TF-Bench</p></details> |

The position of the MP is updated via the API in an automated manner over a set of samples within a shell enclosing the surface of the CFS. For each pose of the manipulator, each pair of legs is investigated for mutual collisions. The CFS is considered safe or validated iff none of the points falling inside the CFS lead to a collision between any pair of legs. This approach can not only validate the safety of a precomputed CFS, but also estimate the same for any spatial parallel manipulator.</p></details> |  |

As a result, numerous quantum programming languages (QPLs) have been introduced to support the development of quantum algorithms. However, the application of Model-Driven Development (MDD) in quantum system engineering remains largely underexplored. This paper presents an MDD-based approach to support the structured design and implementation of quantum systems. Our framework enables the automatic generation of quantum code for multiple QPLs, thereby enhancing development efficiency and consistency across heterogeneous quantum platforms.

| **[Co-Evolutionary Defence of Active Directory Attack Graphs via GNN-Approximated Dynamic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11710v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern enterprise networks increasingly rely on Active Directory (AD) for identity and access management. However, this centralization exposes a single point of failure, allowing adversaries to compromise high-value assets. Existing AD defense approaches often assume static attacker behavior, but real-world adversaries adapt dynamically, rendering such methods brittle. To address this, we model attacker-defender interactions in AD as a Stackelberg game between an adaptive attacker and a proactive defender. We propose a co-evolutionary defense framework that combines Graph Neural Network Approximated Dynamic Programming (GNNDP) to model attacker strategies, with Evolutionary Diversity Optimization (EDO) to generate resilient blocking strategies. To ensure scalability, we introduce a Fixed-Parameter Tractable (FPT) graph reduction method that reduces complexity while preserving strategic structure. Our framework jointly refines attacker and defender policies to improve generalization and prevent premature convergence. Experiments on synthetic AD graphs show near-optimal results (within 0.1 percent of optimality on r500) and improved performance on larger graphs (r1000 and r2000), demonstrating the framework's scalability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Our key idea is to impose syntactic and semantic biases on programs generated by LLMs, such that the synthesized program is more amenable to automated verification. Based on this idea, we propose a novel specification-verification tool, built on top of Verified Software Toolchain, that help automate the process. Our experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks drawn from the deductive program synthesis community, shows that this approach is scalable and extensible. The benchmarks constitute of specifications comprising of basic coding examples, Separation Logic based assertions, and API specifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[When AI Takes the Wheel: Security Analysis of Framework-Constrained Program Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16823v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the AI wave has grown rapidly in software development. Even novice developers can now design and generate complex framework-constrained software systems based on their high-level requirements with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, when LLMs gradually "take the wheel" of software development, developers may only check whether the program works. They often miss security problems hidden in how the generated programs are implemented. In this work, we investigate the security properties of framework-constrained programs generated by state-of-the-art LLMs. We focus specifically on Chrome extensions due to their complex security model involving multiple privilege boundaries and isolated components. To achieve this, we built ChromeSecBench, a dataset with 140 prompts based on known vulnerable extensions. We used these prompts to instruct nine state-of-the-art LLMs to generate complete Chrome extensions, and then analyzed them for vulnerabilities across three dimensions: scenario types, model differences, and vulnerability categories. Our results show that LLMs produced vulnerable programs at alarmingly high rates (18%-50%), particularly in Authentication & Identity and Cookie Management scenarios (up to 83% and 78% respectively). Most vulnerabilities exposed sensitive browser data like cookies, history, or bookmarks to untrusted code. Interestingly, we found that advanced reasoning models performed worse, generating more vulnerabilities than simpler models. These findings highlight a critical gap between LLMs' coding skills and their ability to write secure framework-constrained programs.</p></details> |  |
