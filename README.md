| **[EffiReasonTrans: RL-Optimized Reasoning for Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18863v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation is a crucial task in software development and maintenance. While recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have improved automated code translation accuracy, these gains often come at the cost of increased inference latency, hindering real-world development workflows that involve human-in-the-loop inspection. To address this trade-off, we propose EffiReasonTrans, a training framework designed to improve translation accuracy while balancing inference latency. We first construct a high-quality reasoning-augmented dataset by prompting a stronger language model, DeepSeek-R1, to generate intermediate reasoning and target translations. Each (source code, reasoning, target code) triplet undergoes automated syntax and functionality checks to ensure reliability. Based on this dataset, we employ a two-stage training strategy: supervised fine-tuning on reasoning-augmented samples, followed by reinforcement learning to further enhance accuracy and balance inference latency. We evaluate EffiReasonTrans on six translation pairs. Experimental results show that it consistently improves translation accuracy (up to +49.2% CA and +27.8% CodeBLEU compared to the base model) while reducing the number of generated tokens (up to -19.3%) and lowering inference latency in most cases (up to -29.0%). Ablation studies further confirm the complementary benefits of the two-stage training framework. Additionally, EffiReasonTrans demonstrates improved translation accuracy when integrated into agent-based frameworks.

| **[High-Fidelity And Complex Test Data Generation For Google SQL Code Generation Services](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17203v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The demand for high-fidelity test data is paramount in industrial settings where access to production data is largely restricted. Traditional data generation methods often fall short, struggling with low-fidelity and the ability to model complex data structures and semantic relationships that are critical for testing complex SQL code generation services like Natural Language to SQL (NL2SQL). In this paper, we address the critical need for generating syntactically correct and semantically relevant high-fidelity mock data for complex data structures that includes columns with nested structures that we frequently encounter in Google workloads. We highlight the limitations of existing approaches used in production, particularly their inability to handle large and complex data structures, as well as the lack of semantically coherent test data that lead to limited test coverage. We demonstrate that by leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) and incorporating strategic pre- and post-processing steps, we can generate syntactically correct and semantically relevant high-fidelity test data that adheres to complex structural constraints and maintains semantic integrity to the SQL test targets (queries/functions). This approach supports comprehensive testing of complex SQL queries involving joins, aggregations, and even deeply nested subqueries, ensuring robust evaluation of SQL code generation services, like NL2SQL and SQL Code Assistant. Our results demonstrate the practical utility of an LLM (\textit{gemini}) based test data generation for industrial SQL code generation services where generating high-fidelity test data is essential due to the frequent unavailability and inaccessibility of production datasets for testing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Undirected Multicast Network Coding Gaps via Locally Decodable Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18737v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The network coding problem asks whether data throughput in a network can be increased using coding (compared to treating bits as commodities in a flow). While it is well-known that a network coding advantage exists in directed graphs, the situation in undirected graphs is much less understood -- in particular, despite significant effort, it is not even known whether network coding is helpful at all for unicast sessions. In this paper we study the multi-source multicast network coding problem in undirected graphs. There are $k$ sources broadcasting each to a subset of nodes in a graph of size $n$. The corresponding combinatorial problem is a version of the Steiner tree packing problem, and the network coding question asks whether the multicast coding rate exceeds the tree-packing rate. We give the first super-constant bound to this problem, demonstrating an example with a coding advantage of $\Omega(\log k)$. In terms of graph size, we obtain a lower bound of $2^{\tilde{\Omega}(\sqrt{\log \log n})}$. We also obtain an upper bound of $O(\log n)$ on the gap. Our main technical contribution is a new reduction that converts locally-decodable codes in the low-error regime into multicast coding instances. This gives rise to a new family of explicitly constructed graphs, which may have other applications.</p></details> | FOCS 2025 |
| **[Adapting Language Balance in Code-Switching Speech](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18724v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite achieving impressive results on standard benchmarks, large foundational models still struggle against code-switching test cases. When data scarcity cannot be used as the usual justification for poor performance, the reason may lie in the infrequent occurrence of code-switched moments, where the embedding of the second language appears subtly. Instead of expecting the models to learn this infrequency on their own, it might be beneficial to provide the training process with labels. Evaluating model performance on code-switching data requires careful localization of code-switching points where recognition errors are most consequential, so that the analysis emphasizes mistakes occurring at those moments. Building on this observation, we leverage the difference between the embedded and the main language to highlight those code-switching points and thereby emphasize learning at those locations. This simple yet effective differentiable surrogate mitigates context bias during generation -- the central challenge in code-switching -- thereby improving the model's robustness. Our experiments with Arabic and Chinese-English showed that the models are able to predict the switching places more correctly, reflected by the reduced substitution error.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to ICASSP 2026</p></details> |
| **[Exploring Influence Factors on LLM Suitability for No-Code Development of End User IoT Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.04710v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>No-Code Development Platforms (NCDPs) empower non-technical end users to build applications tailored to their specific demands without writing code. While NCDPs lower technical barriers, users still require some technical knowledge, e.g., to structure process steps or define event-action rules. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution to further reduce technical requirements by supporting natural language interaction and dynamic code generation. By integrating LLM, NCDPs can be more accessible to non-technical users, enabling application development truly without requiring any technical expertise. Despite growing interest in LLM-powered NCDPs, a systematic investigation into the factors influencing LLM suitability and performance remains absent. Understanding these factors is critical to effectively leveraging LLMs capabilities and maximizing their impact. In this paper, we investigate key factors influencing the effectiveness of LLMs in supporting end-user application development within NCDPs. By conducting comprehensive experiments, we evaluate the impact of four key factors, i.e., model selection, prompt language, training data background, and an error-informed few-shot setup, on the quality of generated applications. Specifically, we selected a range of LLMs based on their architecture, scale, design focus, and training data, and evaluated them across four real-world smart home automation scenarios implemented on a representative open-source LLM-powered NCDP. Our findings offer practical insights into how LLMs can be effectively integrated into NCDPs, informing both platform design and the selection of suitable LLMs for end-user application development.</p></details> |  |
| **[ReVeal: Self-Evolving Code Agents via Reliable Self-Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.11442v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reinforcement learning with verifiable rewards (RLVR) has advanced the reasoning capabilities of large language models. However, existing methods rely solely on outcome rewards, without explicitly optimizing verification or leveraging reliable signals from realistic environments, leading to unreliable self-verification and limited test-time scaling. To address this, we widen the verification-generation asymmetry by explicitly optimizing self-verification, making it a reliable driver of deeper test-time scaling. We introduce ReVeal, a multi-turn reinforcement learning framework that evolves code generation through self-verification and tool-based evaluation. ReVeal structures long-horizon reasoning as iterative generation-verification turns and incorporates TAPO for turn-level credit assignment, fostering the co-evolution of code and test generation. At inference, this strengthened self-verification enables the model to use self-constructed tests and tool feedback to continuously evolve code for 20+ turns on LiveCodeBench despite training on only three. It also significantly improves Pass@k, indicating stronger exploration that expands the reasoning boundaries of the base model. These findings highlight the promise of ReVeal as a scalable paradigm for RL training and test-time scaling, paving the way for more robust and autonomous AI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Structured Evaluation Framework for Low-Code Platform Selection: A Multi-Criteria Decision Model for Enterprise Digital Transformation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18590v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid adoption of Low-Code Development Platforms (LCDPs) has created a critical need for systematic evaluation methodologies that enable organizations to make informed platform selection decisions. This paper presents a comprehensive evaluation framework based on five key criteria: Business Process Orchestration, UI/UX Customization, Integration and Interoperability, Governance and Security, and AI-Enhanced Automation. We propose a weighted scoring model that allows organizations to quantitatively assess and compare different low-code platforms based on their specific requirements and strategic priorities. The framework addresses the gap between marketing-driven platform comparisons and rigorous, context-specific evaluation methodologies. Through empirical validation in enterprise environments, we demonstrate how this structured approach can significantly improve decision-making outcomes and reduce the risk of platform lock-in or inadequate solution selection.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 1 figure.

| **[PEACE: Towards Efficient Project-Level Efficiency Optimization via Hybrid Code Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17142v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant capability in code generation, but their potential in code efficiency optimization remains underexplored. Previous LLM-based code efficiency optimization approaches exclusively focus on function-level optimization and overlook interaction between functions, failing to generalize to real-world development scenarios. Code editing techniques show great potential for conducting project-level optimization, yet they face challenges associated with invalid edits and suboptimal internal functions. To address these gaps, we propose Peace, a novel hybrid framework for Project-level code Efficiency optimization through Automatic Code Editing, which also ensures the overall correctness and integrity of the project. Peace integrates three key phases: dependency-aware optimizing function sequence construction, valid associated edits identification, and efficiency optimization editing iteration. To rigorously evaluate the effectiveness of Peace, we construct PeacExec, the first benchmark comprising 146 real-world optimization tasks from 47 high-impact GitHub Python projects, along with highly qualified test cases and executable environments. Extensive experiments demonstrate Peace's superiority over the state-of-the-art baselines, achieving a 69.2% correctness rate (pass@1), +46.9% opt rate, and 0.840 speedup in execution efficiency. Notably, our Peace outperforms all baselines by significant margins, particularly in complex optimization tasks with multiple functions. Moreover, extensive experiments are also conducted to validate the contributions of each component in Peace, as well as the rationale and effectiveness of our hybrid framework design.</p></details> |  |
| **[VAPU: System for Autonomous Legacy Code Modernization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18509v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this study, we present a solution for the modernization of legacy applications, an area of code generation where LLM-based multi-agent systems are proving essential for complex multi-phased tasks. Legacy applications often contain deprecated components that create compatibility, security, and reliability risks, but high resource costs make companies hesitate to update. We take a step forward to integrate an LLM-based multi-agent system as part of a legacy web application update to provide a cost-effective solution to update legacy applications autonomously. We propose a multi-agent system named a Verifying Agent Pipeline Updater (VAPU), which is designed to update code files in phases while simulating different roles in a software development team. In our previous study, we evaluated the system for legacy version updates by using six legacy web application view files by resulting errors and accomplished requirements. This study extends the previous evaluation of a multi-agent pipeline system by extending the evaluation of VAPU from a single LLM to five LLMs and using the temperature parameter in both 0 to 1 settings. Additionally, we tested the system with 20 open-source Python GitHub projects. The results of the evaluation were compared to Zero-Shot Learning (ZSL) and One-Shot Learning (OSL) prompts. The extended evaluation of VAPU showed that particularly in a low-temperature VAPU can get similar level of error count compared to the ZSL/OSL prompts but with a higher level of fulfilled requirements, depending on the LLM. VAPU showed up to 22.5% increase in the succeeding Python file update requirements compared to ZSL/OSL prompts. The study indicates that an LLM-based multi-agent system is a capable solution to update components of a legacy application autonomously.</p></details> | Table 13, figure 2 |
| **[Exploring Data-Efficient Adaptation of Large Language Models for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.00046v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although Large Language Models (LLMs) have made significant progress in code generation, they still struggle with code generation tasks in specific scenarios. These scenarios usually necessitate the adaptation of LLMs to fulfill specific needs, but the limited training data available in practice leads to poor code generation performance. Therefore, how to effectively adapt LLMs to new scenarios with few training data is a major challenge for current code generation. In this paper, we propose a novel adaptation approach named DEED, which stands for Data-Efficient adaptation with Error-Driven learning for code generation. DEED leverages the errors made by LLMs as learning opportunities, using error revision to overcome their own shortcomings, thus achieving efficient learning. Specifically, DEED involves identifying error code generated by LLMs, employing Self-Revise for code revision, optimizing the model with revised code, and iteratively adapting the process for continuous improvement. Experimental results show that, compared to other mainstream fine-tuning approaches, DEED achieves superior performance with few training data, showing an average relative improvement of 46.2% in Pass@1 on multiple code generation benchmarks. We also validate the effectiveness of Self-Revise, which generates revised code that optimizes the model more efficiently compared to the code samples from datasets. Moreover, DEED consistently demonstrates strong performance across various LLMs, underscoring its applicability.</p></details> | Accepted by TOSEM |
| **[CodeRL+: Improving Code Generation via Reinforcement with Execution Semantics Alignment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18471v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code generation by learning from vast code corpora, a fundamental semantic gap remains between their training on textual patterns and the goal of functional correctness, which is governed by formal execution semantics. Reinforcement Learning with Verifiable Rewards (RLVR) approaches attempt to bridge this gap using outcome rewards from executing test cases. However, solely relying on binary pass/fail signals is inefficient for establishing a well-aligned connection between the textual representation of code and its execution semantics, especially for subtle logical errors within the code. In this paper, we propose CodeRL+, a novel approach that integrates execution semantics alignment into the RLVR training pipeline for code generation. CodeRL+ enables the model to infer variable-level execution trajectory, providing a direct learning signal of execution semantics. CodeRL+ can construct execution semantics alignment directly using existing on-policy rollouts and integrates seamlessly with various RL algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeRL+ outperforms post-training baselines (including RLVR and Distillation), achieving a 4.6% average relative improvement in pass@1. CodeRL+ generalizes effectively to other coding tasks, yielding 15.5% and 4.4% higher accuracy on code-reasoning and test-output-generation benchmarks, respectively. CodeRL+ shows strong applicability across diverse RL algorithms and LLMs. Furthermore, probe analyses provide compelling evidence that CodeRL+ strengthens the alignment between code's textual representations and its underlying execution semantics.</p></details> |  |
| **[Human to Document, AI to Code: Three Case Studies of Comparing GenAI for Notebook Competitions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18430v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational notebooks have become the preferred tool of choice for data scientists and practitioners to perform analyses and share results. Notebooks uniquely combine scripts with documentation. With the emergence of generative AI (GenAI) technologies, it is increasingly important, especially in competitive settings, to distinguish the characteristics of human-written versus GenAI. In this study, we present three case studies to explore potential strengths of both humans and GenAI through the coding and documenting activities in notebooks. We first characterize differences between 25 code and documentation features in human-written, medal-winning Kaggle notebooks. We find that gold medalists are primarily distinguished by longer and more detailed documentation. Second, we analyze the distinctions between human-written and GenAI notebooks. Our results show that while GenAI notebooks tend to achieve higher code quality (as measured by metrics like code smells and technical debt), human-written notebooks display greater structural diversity, complexity, and innovative approaches to problem-solving. Based on these results, we envision the work as groundwork that highlight four agendas to further investigate how GenAI could be utilized in notebooks that maximizes the potential collaboration between human and AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[RESCUE: Retrieval Augmented Secure Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18204v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances, Large Language Models (LLMs) still generate vulnerable code. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) has the potential to enhance LLMs for secure code generation by incorporating external security knowledge. However, the conventional RAG design struggles with the noise of raw security-related documents, and existing retrieval methods overlook the significant security semantics implicitly embedded in task descriptions. To address these issues, we propose RESCUE, a new RAG framework for secure code generation with two key innovations. First, we propose a hybrid knowledge base construction method that combines LLM-assisted cluster-then-summarize distillation with program slicing, producing both high-level security guidelines and concise, security-focused code examples. Second, we design a hierarchical multi-faceted retrieval to traverse the constructed knowledge base from top to bottom and integrates multiple security-critical facts at each hierarchical level, ensuring comprehensive and accurate retrieval. We evaluated RESCUE on four benchmarks and compared it with five state-of-the-art secure code generation methods on six LLMs. The results demonstrate that RESCUE improves the SecurePass@1 metric by an average of 4.8 points, establishing a new state-of-the-art performance for security. Furthermore, we performed in-depth analysis and ablation studies to rigorously validate the effectiveness of individual components in RESCUE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Proof2Silicon: Prompt Repair for Verified Code and Hardware Generation via Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.06239v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in automated code generation but frequently produce code that fails formal verification, an essential requirement for hardware and safety-critical domains. To overcome this fundamental limitation, we previously proposed PREFACE, a model-agnostic framework based on reinforcement learning (RL) that iteratively repairs the prompts provided to frozen LLMs, systematically steering them toward generating formally verifiable Dafny code without costly fine-tuning. This work presents Proof2Silicon, a novel end-to-end synthesis framework that embeds the previously proposed PREFACE flow to enable the generation of correctness-by-construction hardware directly from natural language specifications. Proof2Silicon operates by: (1) leveraging PREFACE's verifier-driven RL agent to optimize prompt generation iteratively, ensuring Dafny code correctness; (2) automatically translating verified Dafny programs into synthesizable high-level C using Dafny's Python backend and PyLog; and (3) employing Vivado HLS to produce RTL implementations. Evaluated rigorously on a challenging 100-task benchmark, PREFACE's RL-guided prompt optimization consistently improved Dafny verification success rates across diverse LLMs by up to 21%. Crucially, Proof2Silicon achieved an end-to-end hardware synthesis success rate of up to 72%, generating RTL designs through Vivado HLS synthesis flows. These results demonstrate a robust, scalable, and automated pipeline for LLM-driven, formally verified hardware synthesis, bridging natural-language specification and silicon realization.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-planning Code Generation with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2303.06689v5)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Although large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive ability in code generation, they are still struggling to address the complicated intent provided by humans. It is widely acknowledged that humans typically employ planning to decompose complex problems and schedule solution steps prior to implementation. To this end, we introduce planning into code generation to help the model understand complex intent and reduce the difficulty of problem-solving. This paper proposes a self-planning code generation approach with large language models, which consists of two phases, namely planning phase and implementation phase. Specifically, in the planning phase, LLM outlines concise and formatted planning steps from the intent. Subsequently, in the implementation phase, the model generates code step by step, guided by the preceding planning steps. We conduct extensive experiments on various code-generation benchmarks across multiple programming languages. Experimental results show that self-planning code generation achieves a relative improvement of up to 25.4% in Pass@1 compared to direct code generation, and up to 11.9% compared to Chain-of-Thought code generation. Moreover, our self-planning approach also enhances the quality of the generated code with respect to correctness, readability, and robustness, as assessed by humans.</p></details> | Accepted by TOSEM |

We propose RLIM, a family of run-length-limited (RLL) codes that form fixed-size codebooks by minimizing the total number of 1-bits, increasing the per-symbol molecule budget under standard power normalizations and thus improving reliability. We develop a provably optimal linear-time greedy decoder that is equivalent to Viterbi decoding under a deterministic last-wins tie-break and has lower computational complexity; empirically, it outperforms first-wins and random Viterbi variants on RLL baselines. Extensive binomial and particle-tracking simulations show that RLIM achieves lower bit error rate (BER) than classical RLL and other prominent coding schemes across a broad range of scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |
| **[From Charts to Code: A Hierarchical Benchmark for Multimodal Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17932v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce Chart2Code, a new benchmark for evaluating the chart understanding and code generation capabilities of large multimodal models (LMMs). Chart2Code is explicitly designed from a user-driven perspective, capturing diverse real-world scenarios and progressively increasing task difficulty. It consists of three levels: Level 1 (Chart Reproduction) reproduces charts from a reference figure and user query; Level 2 (Chart Editing) involves complex modifications such as changing chart types or adding elements; and Level 3 (Long-Table to Chart Generation) requires models to transform long, information-dense tables into faithful charts following user instructions. To our knowledge, this is the first hierarchical benchmark that reflects practical chart2code usage while systematically scaling task complexity. In total, Chart2Code contains 2,023 tasks across 22 chart types, paired with multi-level evaluation metrics that assess both code correctness and the visual fidelity of rendered charts. We benchmark 25 state-of-the-art (SoTA) LMMs, including both proprietary and the latest open-source models such as GPT-5, Qwen2.5-VL, InternVL3/3.5, MiMo-VL, and Seed-1.6-VL. Experimental results demonstrate that even the SoTA model GPT-5 averages only 0.57 on code-based evaluation and 0.22 on chart-quality assessment across the editing tasks, underscoring the difficulty of Chart2Code. We anticipate this benchmark will drive advances in multimodal reasoning and foster the development of more robust and general-purpose LMMs. Our code and data are available on Chart2Code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reasoning Distillation and Structural Alignment for Improved Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17598v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective code generation with language models hinges on two critical factors: accurately understanding the intent of the prompt and generating code that applies algorithmic reasoning to produce correct solutions capable of passing diverse test cases while adhering to the syntax of the target programming language. Unlike other language tasks, code generation requires more than accurate token prediction; it demands comprehension of solution-level and structural relationships rather than merely generating the most likely tokens. very large language model (VLLM) are capable of generating detailed steps toward the correct solution of complex tasks where reasoning is crucial in solving the problem. Such reasoning capabilities may be absent in smaller language models. Therefore, in this work, we distill the reasoning capabilities of a VLLM into a smaller, more efficient model that is faster and cheaper to deploy. Our approach trains the model to emulate the reasoning and problem-solving abilities of the VLLM by learning to identify correct solution pathways and establishing a structural correspondence between problem definitions and potential solutions through a novel method of structure-aware loss optimization. This enables the model to transcend token-level generation and to deeply grasp the overarching structure of solutions for given problems. Experimental results show that our fine-tuned model, developed through a cheap and simple to implement process, significantly outperforms our baseline model in terms of pass@1, average data flow, and average syntax match metrics across the MBPP, MBPP Plus, and HumanEval benchmarks.</p></details> |  |
| **[HGAdapter: Hypergraph-based Adapters in Language Models for Code Summarization and Clone Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17591v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pre-trained language models (PLMs) are increasingly being applied to code-related tasks. Although PLMs have achieved good results, they do not take into account potential high-order data correlations within the code. We propose three types of high-order correlations in code tokens, i.e. abstract syntax tree family correlation, lexical correlation, and line correlation. We design a tokens and hyperedges generator to capture these high-order data correlations. We improve the architecture of hypergraph neural networks and combine it with adapter tuning to propose a novel hypergraph-based adapter (HGAdapter) to fine-tune PLMs. HGAdapter can encode high-order data correlations and is allowed to be inserted into various PLMs to enhance performance. Experiments were conducted on several public datasets, including six languages of code summarization and code clone detection tasks. Our methods improved the performance of PLMs in datasets to varying degrees. Experimental results validate the introduction of high-order data correlations that contribute to improved effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 2025 Conference on Empirical Methods in Natural Language Processing (EMNLP 2025) as a findings long paper</p></details> |
| **[ScreenCoder: Advancing Visual-to-Code Generation for Front-End Automation via Modular Multimodal Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.22827v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating the transformation of user interface (UI) designs into front-end code holds significant promise for accelerating software development and democratizing design workflows. While multimodal large language models (MLLMs) can translate images to code, they often fail on complex UIs, struggling to unify visual perception, layout planning, and code synthesis within a single monolithic model, which leads to frequent perception and planning errors. To address this, we propose ScreenCoder, a modular multi-agent framework that decomposes the task into three interpretable stages: grounding, planning, and generation. By assigning these distinct responsibilities to specialized agents, our framework achieves significantly higher robustness and fidelity than end-to-end approaches. Furthermore, ScreenCoder serves as a scalable data engine, enabling us to generate high-quality image-code pairs. We use this data to fine-tune open-source MLLM via a dual-stage pipeline of supervised fine-tuning and reinforcement learning, demonstrating substantial gains in its UI generation capabilities. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance in layout accuracy, structural coherence, and code correctness.

Existing evaluation approaches fall into three categories, including human-centered, metric-based, and LLM-based. Considering that human-centered approaches are labour-intensive and metric-based ones overly rely on reference answers, LLM-based approaches are gaining increasing attention due to their stronger contextual understanding capabilities. However, they generally evaluate the generated code based on static prompts, and tend to fail for complex code scenarios which typically involve multiple requirements and require more contextual information. In addition, these approaches lack fine-grained evaluation for complex code, resulting in limited explainability. To mitigate the limitations, we propose CodeVisionary, the first agent-based evaluation framework for complex code generation. CodeVisionary consists of two stages: (1) Requirement-guided multi-dimensional context distillation stage and (2) Fine-grained scoring and summarization stage. A comprehensive evaluation report is also generated for enhanced explainability. For validation, we construct a new benchmark consisting of 363 samples spanning 37 coding scenarios and 23 programming languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeVisionary achieves the best performance among three baselines for evaluating complex code generation, outperforming the best baseline with average improvements of 0.217, 0.163, and 0.141 in Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall-Tau coefficients, respectively. The resources of CodeVisionary are available at https://github.com/Eshe0922/CodeVisionary.</p></details> |  |
| **[Construction of Additive Complementary Dual Codes Over Finite Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2302.11791v4)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we investigate additive complementary dual (ACD) codes and their construction over finite fields $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ with respect to the trace inner products, where $q$ is a prime power. First, we associate an additive code with a matrix known as a generator matrix. After that, we describe ACD codes in terms of generator matrices for the trace Hermitian and the trace Euclidean inner products. We also construct ACD codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ from linear codes over $\mathbb{F}_q.$ Additionally, we present techniques for constructing ACD codes with various parameters from a given ACD code over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}.$ By applying these methods, we construct numbers of trace Euclidean and trace Hermitian ACD codes that exhibit better parameters compared to the best known linear codes over $\mathbb{F}_9$ and $\mathbb{F}_4$ of the same size and length.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpecAgent: A Speculative Retrieval and Forecasting Agent for Code Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17925v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at code-related tasks but often struggle in realistic software repositories, where project-specific APIs and cross-file dependencies are crucial. Retrieval-augmented methods mitigate this by injecting repository context at inference time. The low inference-time latency budget affects either retrieval quality or the added latency adversely impacts user experience. We address this limitation with SpecAgent, an agent that improves both latency and code-generation quality by proactively exploring repository files during indexing and constructing speculative context that anticipates future edits in each file. This indexing-time asynchrony allows thorough context computation, masking latency, and the speculative nature of the context improves code-generation quality. Additionally, we identify the problem of future context leakage in existing benchmarks, which can inflate reported performance. To address this, we construct a synthetic, leakage-free benchmark that enables a more realistic evaluation of our agent against baselines. Experiments show that SpecAgent consistently achieves absolute gains of 9-11% (48-58% relative) compared to the best-performing baselines, while significantly reducing inference latency.</p></details> |  |

Stabiliser codes were introduced as a means to protect information when storing or applying computations in Hilbert spaces where the local dimension is fixed, i.e. in Hilbert spaces of the form $({\mathbb C}^D)^{\otimes n}$. If $D$ is a prime power then one can consider stabiliser codes over finite fields \cite{KKKS2006}, which allows a deeper mathematical structure to be used to develop stabiliser codes. However, there is no practical reason that the subsystems should have the same local dimension and in this article we introduce a stabiliser formalism for mixed dimensional Hilbert spaces, i.e. of the form ${\mathbb C}^{D_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes {\mathbb C}^{D_n}$. More generally, we define and prove a Singleton bound for quantum error-correcting codes of mixed dimensional Hilbert spaces. We redefine entanglement measures for these Hilbert spaces and follow \cite{HESG2018} and define absolutely maximally entangled states as states which maximise this entanglement measure. We provide examples of absolutely maximally entangled states in spaces of dimensions not previously known to have absolutely maximally entangled states.</p></details> |  |

Despite this rapid progress, a significant gap remains in how to comprehensively evaluate these models' trustworthiness in real-world software engineering scenarios. Existing benchmarks suffer from limited task scope and fail to incorporate critical evaluation aspects such as the robustness and reliability of models. To bridge this gap, we present an evaluation framework called TREAT (Code LLMs Trustworthiness / Reliability Evaluation And Testing) that provides a holistic assessment of model performance in code intelligence tasks. Our evaluation framework addresses key limitations in existing approaches with four main improvements: (1) Multi-Task Holistic Evaluation that spans diverse software engineering activities rather than limited coding tasks; (2) Multi-Language and Multi-Modality Assessment that extends beyond traditional single-language, text-only benchmarks to include multi-modality coding tasks; (3) Robustness Assessment that evaluates model reliability under semantically-preserving code transformations; and (4) Rigorous Evaluation Methodology that enhances the trustworthiness of evaluation results through diverse evaluation prompts and adaptive solution extraction. Based on this evaluation framework, we assess 26 state-of-the-art models and uncover both their strengths and limitations, yielding several key insights:(1) Current models show substantial performance variation across programming tasks; (2) Multi-modal language models demonstrate specific performance limitations in UI code generation and edit;</p></details> |  |

However, crafting and tagging KCs to problems, traditionally performed by human domain experts, is highly labor intensive. We present an automated, LLM-based pipeline for KC generation and tagging for open-ended programming problems. We also develop an LLM-based knowledge tracing (KT) framework to leverage these LLM-generated KCs, which we refer to as KCGen-KT. We conduct extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations on two real-world student code submission datasets in different programming languages.We find that KCGen-KT outperforms existing KT methods and human-written KCs on future student response prediction. We investigate the learning curves of generated KCs and show that LLM-generated KCs result in a better fit than human written KCs under a cognitive model. We also conduct a human evaluation with course instructors to show that our pipeline generates reasonably accurate problem-KC mappings.</p></details> |  |
| **[SEER: Enhancing Chain-of-Thought Code Generation through Self-Exploring Deep Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17130v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation, the task of creating executable programs from natural language requirements, has recently seen tremendous advances through Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning, which enables Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop high-level reasoning plans before writing code. Recent research has proposed various methods to enhance models' CoT reasoning for code generation such as prompt engineering and supervised fine-tuning. However, existing approaches still face three critical limitations: (1) limited exploration of diverse reasoning paths, which constrains generalization across various programming scenarios, (2) lack of quality assessment for intermediate reasoning steps, which hampers the reliability of the generated plans and code, and (3) the potential negative impact of "overthinking", potentially leading to unnecessarily complex and incorrect solutions. To address these limitations, we frame CoT code generation as a decision making problem and present SEER, a SElf-Exploring deep Reasoning framework that enables accurate and adaptive reasoning for code generation. SEER introduces three key components: (1) Diverse reasoning path exploration, which aims at exploring diverse reasoning paths and annotating intermediate steps without relying on manual experts or closed-source proprietary models; (2) Reasoning quality-aware model training, which trains a policy model for generating candidate reasoning steps and a value model for assessing their quality; and (3) Adaptive CoT reasoning, which dynamically switches between direct generation and step-by-step reasoning for different problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper was completed in Feb. 2025, submitted to ICSE 2026 in Mar. 2025, received a major revision in Jun. 2025, and was finally accepted in Oct. 2025</p></details> |
| **[Matricial Free Energy as a Gaussianizing Regularizer: Enhancing Autoencoders for Gaussian Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17120v1)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a novel regularization scheme for autoencoders based on matricial free energy. Our approach defines a differentiable loss function in terms of the singular values of the code matrix (code dimension x batch size). From the standpoint of free probability an d random matrix theory, this loss achieves its minimum when the singular value distribution of the code matrix coincides with that of an appropriately sculpted random metric with i.i.d. Gaussian entries. Empirical simulations demonstrate that minimizing the negative matricial free energy through standard stochastic gradient-based training yields Gaussian-like codes that generalize across training and test sets. Building on this foundation, we propose a matricidal free energy maximizing autoencoder that reliably produces Gaussian codes and show its application to underdetermined inverse problems.</p></details> |  |

However, creating engaging VR presentations remains a challenging and time-consuming task for users, hindering the full realization of VR presentation's capabilities. This research aims to explore the potential of VR presentation, analyze users' opinions, and investigate these via providing a user-friendly no-coding authoring tool. Through an examination of popular presentation software and interviews with seven professionals, we identified five design aspects and four design challenges for VR presentations. Based on the findings, we developed VRStory, a prototype for presentation authoring without coding to explore the design aspects and strategies for addressing the challenges. VRStory offers a variety of predefined and customizable VR elements, as well as modules for layout design, navigation control, and asset generation. A user study was then conducted with 12 participants to investigate their opinions and authoring experience with VRStory. Our results demonstrated that, while acknowledging the advantages of immersive and spatial features in VR, users often have a consistent mental model for traditional 2D presentations and may still prefer planar and static formats in VR for better accessibility and efficient communication. We finally shared our learned design considerations for future development of VR presentation tools, emphasizing the importance of balancing of promoting immersive features and ensuring accessibility.</p></details> |  |

However, their large data volumes and bandwidth constraints hinder the deployment of high-quality services in resource-limited environments. Progres- sive coding, which allows for decoding at varying levels of detail, provides an alternative by allowing initial partial decoding with subsequent refinement. Although recent learning-based point cloud geometry coding methods have achieved notable success, their fixed latent representation does not support progressive decoding. To bridge this gap, we propose ProDAT, a novel density-aware tail-drop mechanism for progressive point cloud coding. By leveraging density information as a guidance signal, latent features and coordinates are decoded adaptively based on their significance, therefore achieving progressive decoding at multiple bitrates using one single model. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that the proposed ProDAT not only enables progressive coding but also achieves superior coding efficiency compared to state-of-the-art learning-based coding techniques, with over 28.6% BD-rate improvement for PSNR- D2 on SemanticKITTI and over 18.15% for ShapeNet</p></details> |  |

| **[Synergistic Enhancement of Requirement-to-Code Traceability: A Framework Combining Large Language Model based Data Augmentation and an Advanced Encoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20149v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated requirement-to-code traceability link recovery, essential for industrial system quality and safety, is critically hindered by the scarcity of labeled data. To address this bottleneck, this paper proposes and validates a synergistic framework that integrates large language model (LLM)-driven data augmentation with an advanced encoder. We first demonstrate that data augmentation, optimized through a systematic evaluation of bi-directional and zero/few-shot prompting strategies, is highly effective, while the choice among leading LLMs is not a significant performance factor. Building on the augmented data, we further enhance an established, state-of-the-art pre-trained language model based method by incorporating an encoder distinguished by a broader pre-training corpus and an extended context window. Our experiments on four public datasets quantify the distinct contributions of our framework's components: on its own, data augmentation consistently improves the baseline method, providing substantial performance gains of up to 26.66%; incorporating the advanced encoder provides an additional lift of 2.21% to 11.25%. This synergy culminates in a fully optimized framework with maximum gains of up to 28.59% on $F_1$ score and 28.9% on $F_2$ score over the established baseline, decisively outperforming ten established baselines from three dominant paradigms. This work contributes a pragmatic and scalable methodology to overcome the data scarcity bottleneck, paving the way for broader industrial adoption of data-driven requirement-to-code traceability.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Many-Shot Prompting Fails: An Empirical Study of LLM Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16809v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) with vast context windows offer new avenues for in-context learning (ICL), where providing many examples ("many-shot" prompting) is often assumed to enhance performance. We investigate this assumption for the complex task of code translation. Through a large-scale empirical study of over 90,000 translations, we systematically evaluate the impact of scaling in-context examples from zero-shot to many-shot configurations of up to 625 examples, with prompts spanning from approximately 100,000 to 800,000 tokens. Our findings reveal a "many-shot paradox": while static similarity metrics may modestly improve with more examples, functional correctness consistently peaks with few-shot prompting (5-25 examples). Providing substantially more examples often degrades this crucial functional performance. This study highlights that for code translation, the quality of a few well-chosen examples outweighs sheer quantity, challenging the universal efficacy of "more is better" for ICL and underscoring the task-dependent nature of optimal prompting strategies. Our results have significant implications for effectively leveraging LLMs in software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[More with Less: An Empirical Study of Turn-Control Strategies for Efficient Coding Agents](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16786v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLM-powered coding agents, which operate in iterative loops (turns) to solve software engineering tasks, are becoming increasingly powerful. However, their practical deployment is hindered by significant and unpredictable costs. This challenge arises from a combination of factors: quadratically growing token counts with each turn, the high price of models, the large number of turns required for real-world tasks, and the tendency of agents to take inefficient or unnecessary actions. While existing research focuses on optimizing individual turns, the strategic control of the total number of turns remains an underexplored area for managing agent performance and cost. To address this gap, we conduct a comprehensive empirical study on SWE-bench using three state-of-the-art models and evaluate the impact of three distinct turn-control strategies: an unrestricted baseline, a fixed-turn limit with reminders, and a novel dynamic-turn strategy that grants extensions on-demand. Our findings first reveal a fundamental trade-off in the unrestricted setting, where no single model excels across performance, cost, and turn efficiency. We then show that a fixed-turn limit, specifically at the 75th percentile of the baseline, serves as a "sweet spot", substantially reducing costs (by 24%-68%) with minimal impact on solve rates. Most significantly, the dynamic-turn strategy consistently outperforms fixed-limit approaches, achieving comparable or better solve rates while further reducing costs by an additional 12%-24% by intelligently allocating resources only to tasks that need them. This work provides the first systematic analysis of turn-control strategies, offering simple yet effective guidelines for developers to balance cost and efficacy. We demonstrate that dynamic resource allocation is a superior, easy-to-implement approach for deploying powerful yet economically viable coding agents.</p></details> |  |

The intricate nature of the process makes it labor-intensive, time-consuming and expert-knowledge-dependent to build a large number of executable code repositories, limiting the scalability of existing work based on running tests. The primary bottleneck lies in the automated building of test environments for different repositories, which is an essential yet underexplored task. To mitigate the gap, we introduce Repo2Run, the first LLM-based agent aiming at automating the building of executable test environments for any repositories at scale. Specifically, given a code repository, Repo2Run iteratively builds the Docker image, runs unit tests based on the feedback of the building, and synthesizes the Dockerfile until the entire pipeline is executed successfully. The resulting Dockerfile can then be used to create Docker container environments for running code and tests. We created a benchmark containing 420 Python repositories with unit tests for evaluation. The results illustrate that Repo2Run achieves an 86.0% success rate, outperforming SWE-agent by 77.0%. The resources of Repo2Run are available at https://github.com/bytedance/Repo2Run.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents QuanBench, a benchmark for evaluating LLMs on quantum code generation. QuanBench includes 44 programming tasks that cover quantum algorithms, state preparation, gate decomposition, and quantum machine learning. Each task has an executable canonical solution and is evaluated by functional correctness (Pass@K) and quantum semantic equivalence (Process Fidelity). We evaluate several recent LLMs, including general-purpose and code-specialized models. The results show that current LLMs have limited capability in generating the correct quantum code, with overall accuracy below 40% and frequent semantic errors. We also analyze common failure cases, such as outdated API usage, circuit construction errors, and incorrect algorithm logic. QuanBench provides a basis for future work on improving quantum code generation with LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper was accepted by ASE2025</p></details> |

As programmers lean more heavily on generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) assistants to develop code solutions, it is becoming increasingly important for programmers to comprehend GenAI solutions so that they can verify their appropriateness and properly integrate them into existing code. At the same time, GenAI tools are increasingly being enlisted to provide programmers with tailored explanations of code written both by GenAI and humans. Thus, in computing education, GenAI presents new challenges and opportunities for learners who are trying to comprehend computer programs. To provide computing educators with evidence-based guidance on the use of GenAI to facilitate code comprehension and to identify directions for future research, we present a systematic literature review (SLR) of state-of-the-art approaches and tools that leverage GenAI to enhance code comprehension. Our SLR focuses on 31 studies published between 2022 and 2024. Despite their potential, GenAI assistants often yield inaccurate or unclear explanations, and novice programmers frequently struggle to craft effective prompts, thereby impeding their ability to leverage GenAI to aid code comprehension. Our review classifies GenAI-based approaches and tools, identifies methods used to study them, and summarizes the empirical evaluations of their effectiveness. We consider the implications of our findings for computing education research and practice, and identify directions for future research.</p></details> |  |

We introduce TritonRL, a domain-specialized LLM for Triton kernel generation, trained with a novel training framework that enables robust and automated kernel synthesis. Unlike general-purpose programming languages, Triton kernel generation faces unique challenges due to data scarcity and incomplete evaluation criteria, vulnerable to reward hacking. Our approach addresses these challenges end-to-end by distilling Triton-specific knowledge through supervised fine-tuning on curated datasets, and further improving code quality via reinforcement learning (RL) with robust, verifiable rewards and hierarchical reward assignment. Our RL framework robustly detects reward hacking and guides both reasoning traces and code tokens through fine-grained verification and hierarchical reward decomposition, enabling the model to generate high-quality Triton kernels that can truly replace existing modules. With robust and fine-grained evaluation, our experiments on KernelBench demonstrate that TritonRL achieves state-of-the-art correctness and speedup, surpassing all other Triton-specific models and underscoring the effectiveness of our RL-based training paradigm.</p></details> |  |

We study the trade-off between communication reliability and information leakage, illustrating that feedback enables agreeing on a secret key shared between legitimate parties, overcoming the security advantage of the wiretapper.

Traditional static metrics often fail to capture the subjective, context-sensitive nature of human judgments. Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a scalable alternative, but their behavior as readability evaluators remains underexplored. We introduce CoReEval, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating LLM-based code readability assessment, comprising over 1.4 million model-snippet-prompt evaluations across 10 state of the art LLMs. The benchmark spans 3 programming languages (Java, Python, CUDA), 2 code types (functional code and unit tests), 4 prompting strategies (ZSL, FSL, CoT, ToT), 9 decoding settings, and developer-guided prompts tailored to junior and senior personas. We compare LLM outputs against human annotations and a validated static model, analyzing numerical alignment (MAE, Pearson's, Spearman's) and justification quality (sentiment, aspect coverage, semantic clustering). Our findings show that developer-guided prompting grounded in human-defined readability dimensions improves alignment in structured contexts, enhances explanation quality, and enables lightweight personalization through persona framing. However, increased score variability highlights trade-offs between alignment, stability, and interpretability. CoReEval provides a robust foundation for prompt engineering, model alignment studies, and human in the loop evaluation, with applications in education, onboarding, and CI/CD pipelines where LLMs can serve as explainable, adaptable reviewers.</p></details> |  |

As part of HLCE, we design a harmonized online-offline sandbox that guarantees fully reproducible evaluation. Through our comprehensive evaluation, we observe that even the strongest reasoning LLMs: o4-mini(high) and Gemini-2.5 Pro, achieve pass@1 rates of only 15.9% and 11.4%, respectively. Meanwhile, we propose a novel "self-recognition" task to measure LLMs' awareness of their own capabilities. Results indicate that LLMs' self-recognition abilities are not proportionally correlated with their code generation performance. Finally, our empirical validation of test-time scaling laws reveals that current advanced LLMs have substantial room for improvement on complex programming tasks. We expect HLCE to become a milestone challenge for code generation and to catalyze advances in high-performance reasoning and human-AI collaborative programming. Our code and dataset are also public available(https://github.com/Humanity-s-Last-Code-Exam/HLCE).</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 Findings |

However, enterprise software development is largely driven by incremental evolution, where challenges extend far beyond routine coding and depend critically on tacit knowledge, including design decisions at different levels and historical trade-offs. To achieve effective AI-powered support for complex software development, we should align emerging AI capabilities with the practical realities of enterprise development. To this end, we systematically identify challenges from both software and LLM perspectives. Alongside these challenges, we outline opportunities where AI and structured knowledge frameworks can enhance decision-making in tasks such as issue localization and impact analysis. To address these needs, we propose the Code Digital Twin, a living framework that models both the physical and conceptual layers of software, preserves tacit knowledge, and co-evolves with the codebase. By integrating hybrid knowledge representations, multi-stage extraction pipelines, incremental updates, LLM-empowered applications, and human-in-the-loop feedback, the Code Digital Twin transforms fragmented knowledge into explicit and actionable representations. Our vision positions it as a bridge between AI advancements and enterprise software realities, providing a concrete roadmap toward sustainable, intelligent, and resilient development and evolution of ultra-complex systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[SemOpt: LLM-Driven Code Optimization via Rule-Based Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16384v1)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated code optimization aims to improve performance in programs by refactoring code, and recent studies focus on utilizing LLMs for the optimization. Typical existing approaches mine optimization commits from open-source codebases to construct a large-scale knowledge base, then employ information retrieval techniques such as BM25 to retrieve relevant optimization examples for hotspot code locations, thereby guiding LLMs to optimize these hotspots. However, since semantically equivalent optimizations can manifest in syntactically dissimilar code snippets, current retrieval methods often fail to identify pertinent examples, leading to suboptimal optimization performance. This limitation significantly reduces the effectiveness of existing optimization approaches. To address these limitations, we propose SemOpt, a novel framework that leverages static program analysis to precisely identify optimizable code segments, retrieve the corresponding optimization strategies, and generate the optimized results. SemOpt consists of three key components: (1) A strategy library builder that extracts and clusters optimization strategies from real-world code modifications. (2) A rule generator that generates Semgrep static analysis rules to capture the condition of applying the optimization strategy. (3) An optimizer that utilizes the strategy library to generate optimized code results. All the three components are powered by LLMs. On our benchmark containing 151 optimization tasks, SemOpt demonstrates its effectiveness under different LLMs by increasing the number of successful optimizations by 1.38 to 28 times compared to the baseline. Moreover, on popular large-scale C/C++ projects, it can improve individual performance metrics by 5.04% to 218.07%, demonstrating its practical utility.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods are often computationally expensive, and the field lacks standardized benchmarks for fair comparison. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a twofold contribution. First, we develop and open-source FJNDF-Pytorch, a unified benchmark for frequency-domain JND-Guided pre-filters. Second, leveraging this platform, we propose a complete learning framework for a novel, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art compression efficiency, consistently outperforming competitors across multiple datasets and encoders. In terms of computational cost, our model is exceptionally lightweight, requiring only 7.15 GFLOPs to process a 1080p image, which is merely 14.1% of the cost of recent lightweight network. Our work presents a robust, state-of-the-art solution that excels in both performance and efficiency, supported by a reproducible research platform.

MLCPD contains over seven million parsed source files normalized under our proposed universal Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) schema, enabling consistent cross-language reasoning, structural learning, and multilingual software analysis. Unlike existing corpora that focus purely on token-level code or isolated parsers, MLCPD provides both hierarchical tree representations and rich metadata for every file, ensuring lossless syntactic coverage and structural uniformity. Each entry includes a normalized schema, language-level metadata, and abstracted node semantics stored in Parquet format for scalable retrieval. Empirical analyses reveal strong cross-language structural regularities-demonstrating that syntactic graphs from languages as diverse as Python, Java, and Go can be aligned under a shared schema. We release the dataset publicly on Hugging Face and the accompanying codebase on GitHub, which includes complete pipelines for dataset reproduction, grammar compilation, and a visualization tool for exploring the unified AST across languages. Together, these resources establish MLCPD as an open, reproducible foundation for future research in cross-language representation learning and program analysis.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 7 figures, 4 tables, 2 algorithms, and 34 references.

| **[VERINA: Benchmarking Verifiable Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23135v2)** | 2025-10-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in software development, but ensuring correctness in LLM-generated code remains challenging and often requires costly manual review. Verifiable code generation -- jointly generating code, specifications, and proofs of code-specification alignment -- offers a promising path to address this limitation and further unleash LLMs' benefits in coding. Yet, there exists a significant gap in evaluation: current benchmarks often focus on only individual components rather than providing a holistic evaluation framework of all tasks. In this paper, we introduce Verina (Verifiable Code Generation Arena), a high-quality benchmark enabling a comprehensive and modular evaluation of code, specification, and proof generation as well as their compositions. Verina consists of 189 manually curated coding tasks in Lean, with detailed problem descriptions, reference implementations, formal specifications, and extensive test suites. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals significant challenges in verifiable code generation, especially in proof generation, underscoring the need for improving LLM-based theorem provers in verification domains. The best model, OpenAI o4-mini, achieves a 61.4\% code correctness rate, 51.0\% for specification soundness and completeness, and a mere 3.6\% proof success rate (based on one trial per task). We hope Verina will catalyze progress in verifiable code generation by providing a rigorous and comprehensive benchmark. We release our dataset on https://huggingface.co/datasets/sunblaze-ucb/verina and our evaluation code on https://github.com/sunblaze-ucb/verina.</p></details> |  |

| **[Code Contribution and Credit in Science](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16242v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software development has become essential to scientific research, but its relationship to traditional metrics of scholarly credit remains poorly understood. We develop a dataset of approximately 140,000 paired research articles and code repositories, as well as a predictive model that matches research article authors with software repository developer accounts. We use this data to investigate how software development activities influence credit allocation in collaborative scientific settings. Our findings reveal significant patterns distinguishing software contributions from traditional authorship credit. We find that nearly 30% of articles include non-author code contributors- individuals who participated in software development but received no formal authorship recognition. While code-contributing authors show a modest $\sim$4.2% increase in article citations, this effect becomes non-significant when controlling for domain, article type, and open access status. First authors are significantly more likely to be code contributors than other author positions. Notably, we identify a negative relationship between coding frequency and scholarly impact metrics. Authors who contribute code more frequently exhibit progressively lower h-indices than non-coding colleagues, even when controlling for publication count, author position, domain, and article type. These results suggest a disconnect between software contributions and credit, highlighting important implications for institutional reward structures and science policy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code Execution as Grounded Supervision for LLM Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.10343v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Training large language models (LLMs) with chain-of-thought (CoT) supervision has proven effective for enhancing their reasoning abilities. However, obtaining reliable and accurate reasoning supervision remains a significant challenge. We propose a scalable method for generating a high-quality CoT supervision dataset by leveraging the determinism of program execution. Unlike existing reasoning dataset generation methods that rely on costly human annotations or error-prone LLM-generated CoT, our approach extracts verifiable, step-by-step reasoning traces from code execution and transforms them into a natural language CoT reasoning. Experiments on reasoning benchmarks across various domains show that our method effectively equips LLMs with transferable reasoning abilities across diverse tasks. Furthermore, the ablation studies validate that our method produces highly accurate reasoning data and reduces overall token length during inference by reducing meaningless repetition and overthinking.</p></details> | EMNLP 2025 |
| **[A Markov Chain Monte Carlo Method for Efficient Finite-Length LDPC Code Design](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.16071v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-density parity-check (LDPC) codes are among the most prominent error-correction schemes. They find application to fortify various modern storage, communication, and computing systems. Protograph-based (PB) LDPC codes offer many degrees of freedom in the code design and enable fast encoding and decoding. In particular, spatially-coupled (SC) and multi-dimensional (MD) circulant-based codes are PB-LDPC codes with excellent performance. Efficient finite-length (FL) algorithms are required in order to effectively exploit the available degrees of freedom offered by SC partitioning, lifting, and MD relocations. In this paper, we propose a novel Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC or MC$^2$) method to perform this FL optimization, addressing the removal of short cycles. While iterating, we draw samples from a defined distribution where the probability decreases as the number of short cycles from the previous iteration increases. We analyze our MC$^2$ method theoretically as we prove the invariance of the Markov chain where each state represents a possible partitioning or lifting arrangement. Via our simulations, we then fit the distribution of the number of cycles resulting from a given arrangement on a Gaussian distribution. We derive estimates for cycle counts that are close to the actual counts. Furthermore, we derive the order of the expected number of iterations required by our approach to reach a local minimum as well as the size of the Markov chain recurrent class. Our approach is compatible with code design techniques based on gradient-descent. Numerical results show that our MC$^2$ method generates SC codes with remarkably less number of short cycles compared with the current state-of-the-art. Moreover, to reach the same number of cycles, our method requires orders of magnitude less overall time compared with the available literature methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages (double column), 4 figures, submitted to the IEEE Transactions on Communications (TCOM)</p></details> |
| **[What's Wrong with Your Code Generated by Large Language Models? An Extensive Study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.06153v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing development of LLMs in code generation has drawn significant attention among researchers. To enhance LLM-based code generation ability, current efforts are predominantly directed towards collecting high-quality datasets and leveraging diverse training technologies. However, there is a notable lack of comprehensive studies examining the limitations and boundaries of existing methods. To bridge this gap, we conducted an extensive empirical study evaluating the performance of three leading closed-source LLMs and six popular open-source LLMs on three commonly used benchmarks. Our investigation, which evaluated the length, cyclomatic complexity and API number of the generated code, revealed that these LLMs face challenges in generating successful code for more complex problems, and tend to produce code that is shorter yet more complicated as compared to canonical solutions. Additionally, we developed a taxonomy of bugs for incorrect codes that includes three categories and ten sub-categories, and analyzed the root cause for common bug types. To better understand the performance of LLMs in real-world projects, we also manually created a real-world benchmark RWPB. We analyzed bugs on RWPB to highlight distinct differences in bug distributions between actual scenarios and existing benchmarks. Finally, we propose a novel training-free iterative method that introduces self-critique, enabling LLMs to critique and correct their generated code based on bug types and compiler feedback. Our comprehensive and extensive study provides insights into the current limitations of LLM-based code generation and opportunities for enhancing the accuracy and quality of the generated code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by SCIENCE CHINA Information Sciences (SCIS)</p></details> |
| **[RustRepoTrans: Repository-level Code Translation Benchmark Targeting Rust](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.13990v6)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in code translation, typically evaluated using benchmarks like CodeTransOcean and RepoTransBench. However, dependency-free benchmarks fail to capture real-world complexities by focusing primarily on simple function-level translations and overlooking repository-level context (e.g., dependencies). Full-repository translation benchmarks significantly exceed the current capabilities of existing models, resulting in performance bottlenecks that fail to provide actionable insights for guiding model development. Furthermore, existing benchmarks do not account for the scenario of incrementally translating new or modified modules from the source to the target language, which demands careful handling of repository-level contexts such as dependencies, cross-module references, and architectural divergence. Moreover, LLMs' effectiveness in translating to newer, low-resource languages like Rust remains largely underexplored. To address these gaps, we introduce RustRepoTrans, the first repository-level context code translation benchmark targeting incremental translation, comprising 375 tasks translating into Rust from C, Java, and Python. Using this benchmark, we evaluate seven representative LLMs, analyzing their errors to assess limitations in complex translation scenarios. Among them, DeepSeek-R1 performs best with 51.5% Pass@1, excelling in both basic functionality and additional translation abilities, such as noise robustness and syntactical difference identification. However, even DeepSeek-R1 experiences a 22.2% performance drop (Pass@1 from 73.7% to 51.5%) when handling repository-level context compared to previous benchmarks without such context.</p></details> |  |
| **[Leveraging Test Driven Development with Large Language Models for Reliable and Verifiable Spreadsheet Code Generation: A Research Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15585v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs), such as ChatGPT, are increasingly leveraged for generating both traditional software code and spreadsheet logic. Despite their impressive generative capabilities, these models frequently exhibit critical issues such as hallucinations, subtle logical inconsistencies, and syntactic errors, risks particularly acute in high stakes domains like financial modelling and scientific computations, where accuracy and reliability are paramount. This position paper proposes a structured research framework that integrates the proven software engineering practice of Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Large Language Model (LLM) driven generation to enhance the correctness of, reliability of, and user confidence in generated outputs. We hypothesise that a "test first" methodology provides both technical constraints and cognitive scaffolding, guiding LLM outputs towards more accurate, verifiable, and comprehensible solutions. Our framework, applicable across diverse programming contexts, from spreadsheet formula generation to scripting languages such as Python and strongly typed languages like Rust, includes an explicitly outlined experimental design with clearly defined participant groups, evaluation metrics, and illustrative TDD based prompting examples. By emphasising test driven thinking, we aim to improve computational thinking, prompt engineering skills, and user engagement, particularly benefiting spreadsheet users who often lack formal programming training yet face serious consequences from logical errors. We invite collaboration to refine and empirically evaluate this approach, ultimately aiming to establish responsible and reliable LLM integration in both educational and professional development practices.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[High Memory Masked Convolutional Codes for PQC](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15515v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents a novel post-quantum cryptosystem based on high-memory masked convolutional codes. Unlike conventional code-based schemes that rely on block codes with fixed dimensions and limited error-correction capability, our construction offers both stronger cryptographic security and greater flexibility. It supports arbitrary plaintext lengths with linear-time decryption and uniform per-bit computational cost, enabling seamless scalability to long messages. Security is reinforced through a higher-rate injection of random errors than in block-code approaches, along with additional noise introduced via polynomial division, which substantially obfuscates the underlying code structure. Semi-invertible transformations generate dense, random-like generator matrices that conceal algebraic properties and resist known structural attacks. Consequently, the scheme achieves cryptanalytic security margins exceeding those of the classic McEliece system by factors greater than 2100. Finally, decryption at the recipient employs an array of parallel Viterbi decoders, enabling efficient hardware and software implementation and positioning the scheme as a strong candidate for deployment in practical quantum-resistant public-key cryptosystems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Code Review through Fuzzing and Likely Invariants](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15512v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many software projects employ manual code review to gatekeep defects and vulnerabilities in the code before integration. However, reviewers often work under time pressure and rely primarily on static inspection, leaving the dynamic aspects of the program unexplored. Dynamic analyses could reveal such behaviors, but they are rarely integrated into reviews. Among them, fuzzing is typically applied later to uncover crashing bugs. Yet its ability to exercise code with diverse inputs makes it promising for exposing non-crashing, but unexpected, behaviors earlier. Still, without suitable mechanisms to analyze program behaviors, the rich data produced during fuzzing remains inaccessible to reviewers, limiting its practical value in this context. We hypothesize that unexpected variations in program behaviors could signify potential bugs. The impact of code changes can be automatically captured at runtime. Representing program behavior as likely invariants, dynamic properties consistently observed at specific program points, can provide practical signals of behavioral changes. Such signals offer a way to distinguish between intended changes and unexpected behavioral shifts from code changes. We present FuzzSight, a framework that leverages likely invariants from non-crashing fuzzing inputs to highlight behavioral differences across program versions. By surfacing such differences, it provides insights into which code blocks may need closer attention. In our evaluation, FuzzSight flagged 75% of regression bugs and up to 80% of vulnerabilities uncovered by 24-hour fuzzing. It also outperformed SAST in identifying buggy code blocks, achieving ten times higher detection rates with fewer false alarms. In summary, FuzzSight demonstrates the potential and value of leveraging fuzzing and invariant analysis for early-stage code review, bridging static inspection with dynamic behavioral insights.</p></details> |  |
| **[Selecting and Combining Large Language Models for Scalable Code Clone Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15480v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Source code clones pose risks ranging from intellectual property violations to unintended vulnerabilities. Effective and efficient scalable clone detection, especially for diverged clones, remains challenging. Large language models (LLMs) have recently been applied to clone detection tasks. However, the rapid emergence of LLMs raises questions about optimal model selection and potential LLM-ensemble efficacy. This paper addresses the first question by identifying 76 LLMs and filtering them down to suitable candidates for large-scale clone detection. The candidates were evaluated on two public industrial datasets, BigCloneBench, and a commercial large-scale dataset. No uniformly 'best-LLM' emerged, though CodeT5+110M, CuBERT and SPTCode were top-performers. Analysis of LLM-candidates suggested that smaller embedding sizes, smaller tokenizer vocabularies and tailored datasets are advantageous. On commercial large-scale dataset a top-performing CodeT5+110M achieved 39.71\% precision: twice the precision of previously used CodeBERT. To address the second question, this paper explores ensembling of the selected LLMs: effort-effective approach to improving effectiveness. Results suggest the importance of score normalization and favoring ensembling methods like maximum or sum over averaging. Also, findings indicate that ensembling approach can be statistically significant and effective on larger datasets: the best-performing ensemble achieved even higher precision of 46.91\% over individual LLM on the commercial large-scale code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Final Code: A Process-Oriented Error Analysis of Software Development Agents in Real-World GitHub Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12374v3)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-driven software development has rapidly advanced with the emergence of software development agents that leverage large language models (LLMs) to tackle complex, repository-level software engineering tasks. These agents go beyond just generation of final code; they engage in multi-step reasoning, utilize various tools for code modification and debugging, and interact with execution environments to diagnose and iteratively resolve issues. However, most existing evaluations focus primarily on static analyses of final code outputs, yielding limited insights into the agents' dynamic problem-solving processes. To fill this gap, we conduct an in-depth empirical study on 3,977 solving-phase trajectories and 3,931 testing-phase logs from 8 top-ranked agents evaluated on 500 GitHub issues in the SWE-Bench benchmark. Our exploratory analysis shows that Python execution errors during the issue resolution phase correlate with lower resolution rates and increased reasoning overheads. We have identified the most prevalent errors -- such as ModuleNotFoundError and TypeError -- and highlighted particularly challenging errors like OSError and database-related issues (e.g., IntegrityError) that demand significantly more debugging effort. Furthermore, we have discovered 3 bugs in the SWE-Bench platform that affect benchmark fairness and accuracy; these issues have been reported to and confirmed by the maintainers. To promote transparency and foster future research, we publicly share our datasets and analysis scripts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted at ICSE 2026, Research Track</p></details> |
| **[Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding for Machines](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15347v1)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As video transmission increasingly serves machine vision systems (MVS) instead of human vision systems (HVS), video coding for machines (VCM) has become a critical research topic. Existing VCM methods often bind codecs to specific downstream models, requiring retraining or supervised data and thus limiting generalization in multi-task scenarios. Recently, unified VCM frameworks have employed visual backbones (VB) and visual foundation models (VFM) to support multiple video understanding tasks with a single codec. They mainly utilize VB/VFM to maintain semantic consistency or suppress non-semantic information, but seldom explore how to directly link video coding with understanding under VB/VFM guidance. Hence, we propose a Symmetric Entropy-Constrained Video Coding framework for Machines (SEC-VCM). It establishes a symmetric alignment between the video codec and VB, allowing the codec to leverage VB's representation capabilities to preserve semantics and discard MVS-irrelevant information. Specifically, a bi-directional entropy-constraint (BiEC) mechanism ensures symmetry between the process of video decoding and VB encoding by suppressing conditional entropy. This helps the codec to explicitly handle semantic information beneficial for MVS while squeezing useless information. Furthermore, a semantic-pixel dual-path fusion (SPDF) module injects pixel-level priors into the final reconstruction. Through semantic-pixel fusion, it suppresses artifacts harmful to MVS and improves machine-oriented reconstruction quality. Experimental results show our framework achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) in rate-task performance, with significant bitrate savings over VTM on video instance segmentation (37.41%), video object segmentation (29.83%), object detection (46.22%), and multiple object tracking (44.94%). We will release our code.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is prepared to submit to the IEEE Transactions</p></details> |

However, existing methods face challenges such as semantic gaps between clinical text and ICD codes, poor performance on rare and long-tail codes, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose TraceCoder, a novel framework integrating multi-source external knowledge to enhance traceability and explainability in ICD coding. TraceCoder dynamically incorporates diverse knowledge sources, including UMLS, Wikipedia, and large language models (LLMs), to enrich code representations, bridge semantic gaps, and handle rare and ambiguous codes. It also introduces a hybrid attention mechanism to model interactions among labels, clinical context, and knowledge, improving long-tail code recognition and making predictions interpretable by grounding them in external evidence. Experiments on MIMIC-III-ICD9, MIMIC-IV-ICD9, and MIMIC-IV-ICD10 datasets demonstrate that TraceCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of its components. TraceCoder offers a scalable and robust solution for automated ICD coding, aligning with clinical needs for accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted as BIBM 2025 Regular.8 pages.Pre-CR version</p></details> |

The approach relies on traversing the boundary in incremental steps. Starting from a corner point with Gaussian code-books, and relying on calculus of variation, it is shown that the end point in each step is achieved using Gaussian code-books. Optimality of Gaussian code-books is first established by limiting the random coding to independent and identically distributed scalar (single-letter) samples. Then, it is shown that the optimum solution for vector inputs coincides with the single-letter case. It is also shown that the maximum number of phases needed to realize the gain due to power allocation over time is two. It is also established that the solution to the Han-Kobayashi achievable rate region, with single letter Gaussian random code-books, achieves the optimum boundary.</p></details> | 43 pages, 7 figures |

As a result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To measure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants differing only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones with over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial shifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates in early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token boundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.</p></details> |  |

The code construction employs an outer distribution matcher (DM) to adapt the rate of the scheme. The DM is coupled with an inner protograph-based low-density parity-check (LDPC) code. The performance achievable by the resulting code structure, that is nonlinear, is studied by means of an equivalent communication model that reduces the problem to the analysis of the inner (linear) LDPC code with transmission that takes place in parallel over the communication channel, and over a suitably defined binary symmetric channel. A density evolution analysis of protograph MN code ensembles is outlined, and it is complemented by an error floor analysis that relies on the derivation of the average input-output weight distribution of the inner LDPC code ensemble. Conditions on the shape of the normalized logarithmic asymptotic input-output weight distribution are defined, which allow discarding code ensembles with bad error floor properties during the code design phase. Examples of code designs are provided, showing how the use of a single LDPC code ensemble allows operating within 1 dB from the Shannon limit over a wide range of code rates, where the code rate is selected by tuning the DM parameters. By enabling rate flexibility with a constant blocklength, and with a fixed LDPC code as inner code, the construction provides an appealing solution for very high-throughput wireless (optical) links that employ binary-input modulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |

This notion gives rise to \emph{hierarchical filtrations}, refining the structure of the Picard group and providing new insights into the geometry of algebraic surfaces. We establish fundamental properties of hierarchical depth, derive inequalities through intersection theory and the Hodge index theorem, and characterize filtrations that are Hodge-tight. Using this framework, we develop a theory of \emph{hierarchical algebraic geometry codes}, constructed from evaluation spaces along these filtrations. This approach produces nested families of codes with controlled growth of parameters and identifies an optimal intermediate code maximizing a utility function balancing rate and minimum distance. Hierarchical depth thus provides a systematic method to construct AG codes with favorable asymptotic behavior, linking geometric and coding-theoretic perspectives. Our results establish new connections between line bundle theory, surface geometry, and coding theory, and suggest applications to generalized Goppa codes and higher-dimensional evaluation codes.</p></details> | Comments are welcome |
| **[Leveraging Code Cohesion Analysis to Identify Source Code Supply Chain Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14778v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supply chain attacks significantly threaten software security with malicious code injections within legitimate projects. Such attacks are very rare but may have a devastating impact. Detecting spurious code injections using automated tools is further complicated as it often requires deciphering the intention of both the inserted code and its context. In this study, we propose an unsupervised approach for highlighting spurious code injections by quantifying cohesion disruptions in the source code. Using a name-prediction-based cohesion (NPC) metric, we analyze how function cohesion changes when malicious code is introduced compared to natural cohesion fluctuations. An analysis of 54,707 functions over 369 open-source C++ repositories reveals that code injection reduces cohesion and shifts naming patterns toward shorter, less descriptive names compared to genuine function updates. Considering the sporadic nature of real supply-chain attacks, we evaluate the proposed method with extreme test-set imbalance and show that monitoring high-cohesion functions with NPC can effectively detect functions with injected code, achieving a Precision@100 of 36.41% at a 1:1,000 ratio and 12.47% at 1:10,000. These results suggest that automated cohesion measurements, in general, and name-prediction-based cohesion, in particular, may help identify supply chain attacks, improving source code integrity.</p></details> |  |

While early benchmarks focus primarily on functional correctness, efficient hardware design demands additional optimization for synthesis metrics such as area, delay, and power. Existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these aspects comprehensively: they often lack optimized baselines or testbenches for verification. To address these gaps, we present Pluto, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to assess the efficiency of LLM-generated Verilog designs. Pluto presents a comprehensive evaluation set of 114 problems with self-checking testbenches and multiple Pareto-optimal reference implementations. Experimental results show that state-of-the-art LLMs can achieve high functional correctness, reaching 78.3\% at pass@1, but their synthesis efficiency still lags behind expert-crafted implementations, with area efficiency of 63.8\%, delay efficiency of 65.9\%, and power efficiency of 64.0\% at eff@1. This highlights the need for efficiency-aware evaluation frameworks such as Pluto to drive progress in hardware-focused LLM research.</p></details> |  |

Most LLMs still struggle with mixed-language inputs, limited CSW datasets, and evaluation biases, hindering deployment in multilingual societies. This survey provides the first comprehensive analysis of CSW-aware LLM research, reviewing 308 studies spanning five research areas, 12 NLP tasks, 30+ datasets, and 80+ languages. We classify recent advances by architecture, training strategy, and evaluation methodology, outlining how LLMs have reshaped CSW modeling and what challenges persist. The paper concludes with a roadmap emphasizing the need for inclusive datasets, fair evaluation, and linguistically grounded models to achieve truly multilingual intelligence.

| **[Coder as Editor: Code-driven Interpretable Molecular Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14455v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular optimization is a central task in drug discovery that requires precise structural reasoning and domain knowledge. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level editing intentions in natural language, they often struggle to faithfully execute these modifications-particularly when operating on non-intuitive representations like SMILES. We introduce MECo, a framework that bridges reasoning and execution by translating editing actions into executable code. MECo reformulates molecular optimization for LLMs as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable editing intentions from a molecule and property goal, followed by translating those intentions into executable structural edits via code generation. Our approach achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits derived from chemical reactions and target-specific compound pairs. On downstream optimization benchmarks spanning physicochemical properties and target activities, MECo substantially improves consistency by 38-86 percentage points to 90%+ and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines while preserving structural similarity. By aligning intention with execution, MECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design, laying the foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative human-AI workflows in drug discovery.</p></details> |  |

Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations, including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled, disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding, where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an average of 10.7\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and models will be released.</p></details> | 10 pages |

We derive explicit asymptotic formulas for the number of equivalence classes under three standard notions of equivalence, for a fixed alphabet size and increasing length. Our approach also yields an exact asymptotic expression for the sum of all q-binomial coefficients, which is of independent interest and answers an open question in this context. Finally, we establish a natural connection between these asymptotic quantities and certain discrete Gaussian distributions arising from Brownian motion, providing a probabilistic interpretation of our results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vector Quantization in the Brain: Grid-like Codes in World Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16039v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose Grid-like Code Quantization (GCQ), a brain-inspired method for compressing observation-action sequences into discrete representations using grid-like patterns in attractor dynamics. Unlike conventional vector quantization approaches that operate on static inputs, GCQ performs spatiotemporal compression through an action-conditioned codebook, where codewords are derived from continuous attractor neural networks and dynamically selected based on actions. This enables GCQ to jointly compress space and time, serving as a unified world model. The resulting representation supports long-horizon prediction, goal-directed planning, and inverse modeling. Experiments across diverse tasks demonstrate GCQ's effectiveness in compact encoding and downstream performance. Our work offers both a computational tool for efficient sequence modeling and a theoretical perspective on the formation of grid-like codes in neural systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoding Balanced Linear Codes With Preprocessing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14347v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prange's information set algorithm is a decoding algorithm for arbitrary linear codes. It decodes corrupted codewords of any $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear code $C$ of message length $n$ up to relative error rate $O(\log n / n)$ in $\mathsf{poly}(n)$ time. We show that the error rate can be improved to $O((\log n)^2 / n)$, provided: (1) the decoder has access to a polynomial-length advice string that depends on $C$ only, and (2) $C$ is $n^{-\Omega(1)}$-balanced. As a consequence we improve the error tolerance in decoding random linear codes if inefficient preprocessing of the code is allowed. This reveals potential vulnerabilities in cryptographic applications of Learning Noisy Parities with low noise rate. Our main technical result is that the Hamming weight of $Hw$, where $H$ is a random sample of *short dual* codewords, measures the proximity of a word $w$ to the code in the regime of interest. Given such $H$ as advice, our algorithm corrects errors by locally minimizing this measure. We show that for most codes, the error rate tolerated by our decoder is asymptotically optimal among all algorithms whose decision is based on thresholding $Hw$ for an arbitrary polynomial-size advice matrix $H$.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniCode: A Framework for Generating High Quality Competitive Coding Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17868v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reliance of competitive coding benchmarks on static, human-authored problems creates significant challenges, including data contamination and limited scalability. To address these issues, we introduce UniCode, a novel framework that automatically generates high-quality algorithmic problems alongside robust, contamination-resistant test cases. Inspired by biological evolution that creates better and diverse offspring, our framework leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to systematically diversify problems through three strategies: single problem extension, same-type fusion, and cross-type fusion. A key innovation is our stress-driven test case synthesis pipeline, which generates reliable test suites without requiring a canonical ground-truth solution. This pipeline combines brute-force grounding for small-scale inputs with a consensus-based validation mechanism for large-scale inputs to ensure high correctness and coverage. We demonstrate effectiveness of our framework by curating a benchmark of 492 problems and evaluating 19 state-of-the-art LLMs. The results reveal that UniCode is highly challenging and discriminative, with the top-performing model, o4-mini, achieving a pass rate of only 70.3%. Our framework provides a scalable and reliable solution for generating dynamic evaluation datasets in coding domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Snippet-Alignment Data Augmentation for Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.15004v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation aims to translate the code from its source language to the target language and is used in various software development scenarios. Recent developments in Large Language Models (LLMs) have showcased their capabilities in code translation, and parallel corpora play a crucial role in training models for code translation. Parallel corpora can be categorized into program-alignment (PA) and snippet-alignment (SA) data. Although PA data has complete context and is suitable for semantic alignment learning, it may not provide adequate fine-grained training signals due to its extended length, while the brevity of SA data enables more fine-grained alignment learning. Due to limited parallel corpora, researchers explore several augmentation methods for code translation. Previous studies mainly focus on augmenting PA data. In this paper, we propose a data augmentation method that leverages LLMs to generate SA data automatically. To fully leverage both PA data and SA data, we explore a simple yet effective two-stage training strategy, which consistently enhances model performance compared to fine-tuning solely on PA data. Experiments on TransCoder-test demonstrate that our augmented SA data combined with the two-stage training approach yields consistent improvements over the baseline, achieving a maximum gain of 3.78% on pass@k.</p></details> |  |

Our framework adapts powerful evolutionary concepts to the LLM domain, building upon recent methods for generalized scientific discovery. CodeEvolve employs an island-based genetic algorithm to maintain population diversity and increase throughput, introduces a novel inspiration-based crossover mechanism that leverages the LLMs context window to combine features from successful solutions, and implements meta-prompting strategies for dynamic exploration of the solution space. We conduct a rigorous evaluation of CodeEvolve on a subset of the mathematical benchmarks used to evaluate Google DeepMind's closed-source AlphaEvolve. Our findings show that our method surpasses AlphaEvolve's performance on several challenging problems. To foster collaboration and accelerate progress, we release our complete framework as an open-source repository.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

Scenic, a domain-specific language (DSL) for CARLA, enables precise and reproducible scenarios, but NL-to-Scenic generation with large language models (LLMs) suffers from scarce data, limited reproducibility, and inconsistent metrics. We introduce NL2Scenic, an open dataset and framework with 146 NL/Scenic pairs, a difficulty-stratified 30-case test split, an Example Retriever, and 14 prompting variants (ZS, FS, CoT, SP, MoT). We evaluate 13 models: four proprietary (GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, Gemini-2.5-pro) and nine open-source code models (Qwen2.5Coder 0.5B-32B; CodeLlama 7B/13B/34B), using text metrics (BLEU, ChrF, EDIT-SIM, CrystalBLEU) and execution metrics (compilation and generation), and compare them with an expert study (n=11). EDIT-SIM correlates best with human judgments; we also propose EDIT-COMP (F1 of EDIT-SIM and compilation) as a robust dataset-level proxy that improves ranking fidelity. GPT-4o performs best overall, while Qwen2.5Coder-14B reaches about 88 percent of its expert score on local hardware. Retrieval-augmented prompting, Few-Shot with Example Retriever (FSER), consistently boosts smaller models, and scaling shows diminishing returns beyond mid-size, with Qwen2.5Coder outperforming CodeLlama at comparable scales. NL2Scenic and EDIT-COMP offer a standardized, reproducible basis for evaluating Scenic code generation and indicate that mid-size open-source models are practical, cost-effective options for autonomous-driving scenario programming.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Low-Density Parity-Check Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14090v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum error correction (QEC) is a cornerstone of quantum computing, enabling reliable information processing in the presence of noise. Sparse stabilizer codes -- referred to generally as quantum low-density parity-check (QLDPC) codes -- have risen to the forefront of QEC research in recent years. This can be attributed to several key factors. First, classical LDPC codes admit low-complexity belief propagation iterative decoding and near-capacity performance, which contributed to the early interest in QLDPC codes. Then, the result promising constant overhead fault tolerance using QLDPC codes led to the search for code families that go beyond the long-holding $\sqrt{n}$ scaling barrier of minimum distance for codelength $n$. This resulted in recent breakthroughs in the construction of QLDPC codes, which, combined with efficient decoding algorithms and the development of fault-tolerant protocols operating on QLDPC-encoded quantum information, provide a promising pathway to low-overhead, fault-tolerant quantum computation. However, despite their potential, challenges remain, particularly in constructing and decoding finite-length codes that account for, or efficiently leverage, specific characteristics of quantum hardware, such as connectivity, topology, native gate sets, and noise models. This article provides an in-depth examination of QLDPC codes and their iterative decoders, catering to an information theory audience with no or limited background in quantum mechanics. We discuss the theoretical underpinnings, explore unique characteristics of quantum channels, and delineate key code constructions and decoding algorithms, ultimately highlighting the impact and future prospects of QLDPC codes in quantum information science.</p></details> | 40 pages, 20 figures |

Among these, backdoor attacks are a significant threat, allowing attackers to manipulate model outputs through hidden triggers embedded in training data. Detecting such backdoors remains a challenge, and one promising approach is the use of Spectral Signature defense methods that identify poisoned data by analyzing feature representations through eigenvectors. While some prior works have explored Spectral Signatures for backdoor detection in neural networks, recent studies suggest that these methods may not be optimally effective for code models. In this paper, we revisit the applicability of Spectral Signature-based defenses in the context of backdoor attacks on code models. We systematically evaluate their effectiveness under various attack scenarios and defense configurations, analyzing their strengths and limitations. We found that the widely used setting of Spectral Signature in code backdoor detection is often suboptimal. Hence, we explored the impact of different settings of the key factors. We discovered a new proxy metric that can more accurately estimate the actual performance of Spectral Signature without model retraining after the defense.</p></details> | 20 pages, 3 figures |
| **[When "Correct" Is Not Safe: Can We Trust Functionally Correct Patches Generated by Code Agents?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.17862v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code agents are increasingly trusted to autonomously fix bugs on platforms such as GitHub, yet their security evaluation focuses almost exclusively on functional correctness. In this paper, we reveal a novel type of threat to real-world code agents: Functionally Correct yet Vulnerable (FCV) patches, which pass all test cases but contain vulnerable code. With our proposed FCV-Attack, which can be deliberately crafted by malicious attackers or implicitly introduced by benign developers, we show that SOTA LLMs (e.g., ChatGPT and Claude) and agent scaffolds (e.g., SWE-agent and OpenHands) are all vulnerable to this FCV threat; across 12 agent-model combinations on SWE-Bench, the attack only requires black-box access and a single query to the code agent to perform the attack. For example, for CWE-538 (information exposure vulnerability), the FCV-Attack attains an attack success rate of $40.7\%$ on GPT-5 Mini + OpenHands. Our results reveal an important security threat overlooked by current evaluation paradigms and urge the development of security-aware defenses for code agents.</p></details> |  |

Very recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), an increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed, facilitating software development and maintenance and demonstrating remarkable performance. However, due to ongoing explorations in the LLM-based APR field, it is challenging for researchers to understand the current achievements, challenges, and potential opportunities. This work provides the first systematic literature review to summarize the applications of LLMs in APR between 2020 and 2025. We analyze 189 relevant papers from LLMs, APR and their integration perspectives. First, we categorize existing popular LLMs that are applied to support APR and outline four types of utilization strategies for their deployment. Besides, we detail some specific repair scenarios that benefit from LLMs, e.g., semantic bugs and security vulnerabilities. Furthermore, we discuss several critical aspects of integrating LLMs into APR research, e.g., input forms and open science. Finally, we highlight a set of challenges remaining to be investigated and the potential guidelines for future research. Overall, our paper provides a systematic overview of the research landscape to the APR community, helping researchers gain a comprehensive understanding of achievements and promote future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>updat...</summary><p>update new papers, up to September 2025</p></details> |
| **[AlphaOPT: Formulating Optimization Programs with Self-Improving LLM Experience Library](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18428v1)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimization modeling enables critical decisions across industries but remains difficult to automate: informal language must be mapped to precise mathematical formulations and executable solver code. Prior LLM approaches either rely on brittle prompting or costly retraining with limited generalization. We present AlphaOPT, a self-improving experience library that enables an LLM to learn from limited demonstrations (even answers alone, without gold-standard programs) and solver feedback - without annotated reasoning traces or parameter updates. AlphaOPT operates in a continual two-phase cycle: (i) a Library Learning phase that reflects on failed attempts, extracting solver-verified, structured insights as {taxonomy, condition, explanation, example}; and (ii) a Library Evolution phase that diagnoses retrieval misalignments and refines the applicability conditions of stored insights, improving transfer across tasks. This design (1) learns efficiently from limited demonstrations without curated rationales, (2) expands continually without costly retraining by updating the library rather than model weights, and (3) makes knowledge explicit and interpretable for human inspection and intervention. Experiments show that AlphaOPT steadily improves with more data (65% to 72% from 100 to 300 training items) and surpasses the strongest baseline by 7.7% on the out-of-distribution OptiBench dataset when trained only on answers. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/Minw913/AlphaOPT.</p></details> |  |
| **[Program Synthesis via Test-Time Transduction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.17393v3)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce transductive program synthesis, a new formulation of the program synthesis task that explicitly leverages test inputs during synthesis. While prior approaches to program synthesis--whether based on natural language descriptions or input-output examples--typically aim to generalize from training examples, they often struggle with robustness, especially in real-world settings where training examples are limited and test inputs involve various edge cases. To address this, we propose a novel framework that improves robustness by treating synthesis as an active learning over a finite hypothesis class defined by programs' outputs. We use an LLM to predict outputs for selected test inputs and eliminate inconsistent hypotheses, where the inputs are chosen via a greedy maximin algorithm to minimize the number of LLM queries required. We evaluate our approach on four benchmarks: Playgol, MBPP+, 1D-ARC, and programmatic world modeling on MiniGrid. We demonstrate that our method significantly improves program synthesis in both accuracy and efficiency. We release our code at https://github.com/klee972/SYNTRA.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Combinatorial Algorithm for Tropical Linearly Factorized Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07596v2)** | 2025-10-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tropical semiring is a set of numbers with addition "max" and multiplication "+". As well as in conventional algebra, linear programming problem in the tropical semiring has been developed. In this study, we introduce a new type of tropical optimization problem, namely, tropical linearly factorized programming problem. This problem involves minimizing the objective function given by the product of tropical linear forms divided by a tropical monomial, subject to tropical linear inequality constraints. The objective function is convex in the conventional sense but not in the tropical sense, while the feasible set is convex in the tropical sense but not in the conventional sense. Our algorithm for tropical linearly factorized programming is based on the descent method and exploits tangent digraphs. First, we demonstrate that the feasible descent direction at the current solution can be obtained by solving the minimum $s$-$t$ cut problem on a specific subgraph of the tangent digraph. Although exponentially many such digraphs may exist in general, a more efficient algorithm is devised in cases where the problem is non-degenerate. Focusing on the fact that tangent digraphs become spanning trees in non-degenerate cases, we present a simplex-like algorithm that updates the tree structure iteratively. We show that each iteration can be executed in $O(r_A+r_C)$ time, where $r_A$ and $r_C$ are the numbers of ``non-zero'' coefficients in the linear constraints and objective function, respectively. For integer instances, our algorithm finds a local optimum in $O((m+n)(r_A+r_C)MD)$ time, where $n$ and $m$ are the number of decision variables and constraints, respectively, $M$ is the maximum absolute value of coefficients and $D$ is the degree of the objective function.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Program Semantics Reasoning with Type Inference in System F](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23686v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into the software engineering ecosystem. Their test-time compute (TTC) reasoning capabilities show significant potential for understanding program logic and semantics beyond mere token recognition. However, current benchmarks for code reasoning lack a formal, program-centric deductive framework to ensure sound evaluation, and are incapable of assessing whether models genuinely reason about program semantics or merely exploit superficial associations between natural language and code tokens. To bridge this gap, we introduce TF-Bench, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLM reasoning based on type inference in System F, a task we refer to as program semantics reasoning. By employing verified transformations to remove semantically irrelevant natural language, we construct TF-Bench_pure, a purely semantics-driven variant of TF-Bench. Our analysis reveals substantial limitations in state-of-the-art LLMs, with the best-performing LLM (Claude-3.7-sonnet) achieving only 55.85% accuracy on TF-Bench_pure. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics to assess robustness and the effectiveness of test-time reasoning, underscoring critical limitations in current LLM capabilities and highlighting essential directions for future research.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS '25, package released at: https://github.com/SecurityLab-UCD/TF-Bench</p></details> |

The position of the MP is updated via the API in an automated manner over a set of samples within a shell enclosing the surface of the CFS. For each pose of the manipulator, each pair of legs is investigated for mutual collisions. The CFS is considered safe or validated iff none of the points falling inside the CFS lead to a collision between any pair of legs. This approach can not only validate the safety of a precomputed CFS, but also estimate the same for any spatial parallel manipulator.</p></details> |  |

As a result, numerous quantum programming languages (QPLs) have been introduced to support the development of quantum algorithms. However, the application of Model-Driven Development (MDD) in quantum system engineering remains largely underexplored. This paper presents an MDD-based approach to support the structured design and implementation of quantum systems. Our framework enables the automatic generation of quantum code for multiple QPLs, thereby enhancing development efficiency and consistency across heterogeneous quantum platforms.

| **[Co-Evolutionary Defence of Active Directory Attack Graphs via GNN-Approximated Dynamic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11710v2)** | 2025-10-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern enterprise networks increasingly rely on Active Directory (AD) for identity and access management. However, this centralization exposes a single point of failure, allowing adversaries to compromise high-value assets. Existing AD defense approaches often assume static attacker behavior, but real-world adversaries adapt dynamically, rendering such methods brittle. To address this, we model attacker-defender interactions in AD as a Stackelberg game between an adaptive attacker and a proactive defender. We propose a co-evolutionary defense framework that combines Graph Neural Network Approximated Dynamic Programming (GNNDP) to model attacker strategies, with Evolutionary Diversity Optimization (EDO) to generate resilient blocking strategies. To ensure scalability, we introduce a Fixed-Parameter Tractable (FPT) graph reduction method that reduces complexity while preserving strategic structure. Our framework jointly refines attacker and defender policies to improve generalization and prevent premature convergence. Experiments on synthetic AD graphs show near-optimal results (within 0.1 percent of optimality on r500) and improved performance on larger graphs (r1000 and r2000), demonstrating the framework's scalability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

Our key idea is to impose syntactic and semantic biases on programs generated by LLMs, such that the synthesized program is more amenable to automated verification. Based on this idea, we propose a novel specification-verification tool, built on top of Verified Software Toolchain, that help automate the process. Our experiments on a diverse set of benchmarks drawn from the deductive program synthesis community, shows that this approach is scalable and extensible. The benchmarks constitute of specifications comprising of basic coding examples, Separation Logic based assertions, and API specifications.</p></details> |  |
| **[When AI Takes the Wheel: Security Analysis of Framework-Constrained Program Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16823v1)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the AI wave has grown rapidly in software development. Even novice developers can now design and generate complex framework-constrained software systems based on their high-level requirements with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, when LLMs gradually "take the wheel" of software development, developers may only check whether the program works. They often miss security problems hidden in how the generated programs are implemented. In this work, we investigate the security properties of framework-constrained programs generated by state-of-the-art LLMs. We focus specifically on Chrome extensions due to their complex security model involving multiple privilege boundaries and isolated components. To achieve this, we built ChromeSecBench, a dataset with 140 prompts based on known vulnerable extensions. We used these prompts to instruct nine state-of-the-art LLMs to generate complete Chrome extensions, and then analyzed them for vulnerabilities across three dimensions: scenario types, model differences, and vulnerability categories. Our results show that LLMs produced vulnerable programs at alarmingly high rates (18%-50%), particularly in Authentication & Identity and Cookie Management scenarios (up to 83% and 78% respectively). Most vulnerabilities exposed sensitive browser data like cookies, history, or bookmarks to untrusted code. Interestingly, we found that advanced reasoning models performed worse, generating more vulnerabilities than simpler models. These findings highlight a critical gap between LLMs' coding skills and their ability to write secure framework-constrained programs.</p></details> |  |

Rethinking Output Validation in Quantum Program Testing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16595v2)** | 2025-10-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As quantum computing continues to emerge, ensuring the quality of quantum programs has become increasingly critical. Quantum program testing has emerged as a prominent research area within the scope of quantum software engineering. While numerous approaches have been proposed to address quantum program quality assurance, our analysis reveals that most existing methods rely on measurement-based validation in practice. However, due to the inherently probabilistic nature of quantum programs, measurement-based validation methods face significant limitations. To investigate these limitations, we conducted an empirical study of recent research on quantum program testing, analyzing measurement-based validation methods in the literature. Our analysis categorizes existing measurement-based validation methods into two groups: distribution-level validation and output-value-level validation. We then compare measurement-based validation with statevector-based validation methods to evaluate their pros and cons. Our findings demonstrate that measurement-based validation is suitable for straightforward assessments, such as verifying the existence of specific output values, while statevector-based validation proves more effective for complicated tasks such as assessing the program behaviors.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper will be appeared in the proceedings of the 40th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Automated Software Engineering (ASE 2025), NIER track, Seoul, South Korea, November 16 -20, 2025</p></details> |

In this paper, we consider the stable roommates problem with ties. In particular, we focus on strong stability, which is one of the main stability concepts in the stable roommates problem with ties. We propose a new polynomial-time algorithm for the problem of checking the existence of a strongly stable matching in the stable roommates problem with ties. More concretely, we extend the linear programming approach of Abeledo and Blum to the stable roommates problem with strict preferences to our problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Imperative vs. Declarative Programming Paradigms for Open-Universe Scene Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05482v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current methods for generating 3D scene layouts from text predominantly follow a declarative paradigm, where a Large Language Model (LLM) specifies high-level constraints that are then resolved by a separate solver. This paper challenges that consensus by introducing a more direct, imperative approach. We task an LLM with generating a step-by-step program that iteratively places each object relative to those already in the scene. This paradigm simplifies the underlying scene specification language, enabling the creation of more complex, varied, and highly structured layouts that are difficult to express declaratively. To improve the robustness, we complement our method with a novel, LLM-free error correction mechanism that operates directly on the generated code, iteratively adjusting parameters within the program to resolve collisions and other inconsistencies. In forced-choice perceptual studies, human participants overwhelmingly preferred our imperative layouts, choosing them over those from two state-of-the-art declarative systems 82% and 94% of the time, demonstrating the significant potential of this alternative paradigm. Finally, we present a simple automated evaluation metric for 3D scene layout generation that correlates strongly with human judgment.</p></details> |  |

Their foundation is the grassroots social graph, upon which grassroots social networks, grassroots cryptocurrencies, and grassroots democratic federations can be built. Grassroots platforms have yet to be implemented, the key challenge being faulty and malicious participants: without secure programming support, correct participants cannot reliably identify each other, establish secure communication, or verify each other's code integrity. We present Grassroots Logic Programs (GLP), a secure, multiagent, concurrent, logic programming language for implementing grassroots platforms. GLP extends logic programs with paired single-reader/single-writer (SRSW) logic variables, providing secure communication channels among cryptographically-identified people through encrypted, signed and attested messages, which enable identity and code integrity verification. We present GLP progressively: logic programs, concurrent GLP, multiagent GLP, augmenting it with cryptographic security, and providing smartphone implementation-ready specifications. We prove safety properties including that GLP computations are deductions, SRSW preservation, acyclicity, and monotonicity. We prove multiagent GLP is grassroots and that GLP streams achieve blockchain security properties. We present a grassroots social graph protocol establishing authenticated peer-to-peer connections and demonstrate secure grassroots social networking applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parameterized Algorithms for Matching Integer Programs with Additional Rows and Columns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05548v2)** | 2025-10-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study integer linear programs (ILP) of the form $\min\{c^\top x\ \vert\ Ax=b,l\le x\le u,x\in\mathbb Z^n\}$ and analyze their parameterized complexity with respect to their distance to the generalized matching problem, following the well-established approach of capturing the hardness of a problem by the distance to triviality. The generalized matching problem is an ILP where each column of the constraint matrix has a $1$-norm of at most $2$. It captures several well-known polynomial time solvable problems such as matching and flow problems. We parameterize by the size of variable and constraint backdoors, which measure the least number of columns or rows that must be deleted to obtain a generalized matching ILP. We present the following results: (i) a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm for ILPs parameterized by the size $p$ of a minimum variable backdoor to generalized matching; (ii) a randomized slice-wise polynomial (XP) time algorithm for ILPs parameterized by the size $p+h$ of a mixed variable plus constraint backdoor to generalized matching as long as $c$ and $A$ are encoded in unary; (iii) we complement (ii) by proving that solving ILPs is W[1]-hard when parameterized by the size of a minimum constraint backdoor $h$ even when all coefficients are bounded. To obtain (i), we prove a variant of lattice-convexity of the degree sequences of weighted $b$-matchings, which we study in the light of SBO jump M-convex functions. This allows us to model the matching part as a polyhedral constraint on the integer backdoor variables. The resulting ILP is solved using an FPT integer programming algorithm. For (ii), the randomized XP time algorithm is obtained by pseudo-polynomially reducing the problem to the exact matching problem. To prevent an exponential blowup in terms of the encoding length of $b$, we bound the proximity of the ILP through a subdeterminant based circuit bound.</p></details> |  |

Novel model architectures and collaboration mechanisms are engineered to accommodate statistical disparities while producing client-specific models. Parameter decoupling represents a promising paradigm for maintaining model performance in PFL frameworks. However, the communication efficiency of many existing methods remains suboptimal, sustaining substantial communication burdens that impede practical deployment. To bridge this gap, we propose Federated Learning with Programmed Update and Reduced INformation (FedPURIN), a novel framework that strategically identifies critical parameters for transmission through an integer programming formulation. This mathematically grounded strategy is seamlessly integrated into a sparse aggregation scheme, achieving a significant communication reduction while preserving the efficacy. Comprehensive evaluations on standard image classification benchmarks under varied non-IID conditions demonstrate competitive performance relative to state-of-the-art methods, coupled with quantifiable communication reduction through sparse aggregation. The framework establishes a new paradigm for communication-efficient PFL, particularly advantageous for edge intelligence systems operating with heterogeneous data sources.</p></details> |  |

Our framework provides a generic denotational reduction -- namely, a denotational product construction -- from linear-time safety verification of effectful higher-order programs to computation of weakest pre-conditions of product programs. This reduction enables us to apply existing algorithms for such well-studied computations of weakest pre-conditions, some of which are available as off-the-shelf solvers. We show the correctness of our denotational product construction by proving a preservation theorem under strong monad morphisms and an existence of suitable liftings along a fibration. We instantiate our framework with both probabilistic and angelic nondeterministic higher-order programs, and implement an automated solver for the probabilistic case based on the existing solver developed by Kura and Unno. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automated verifier for linear-time temporal verification of probabilistic higher-order programs with recursion.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint.

In particular, we design an adaptive program repair method based on issue description response, called SIADAFIX. The proposed method utilizes slow thinking bug fix agent to complete complex program repair tasks, and employs fast thinking workflow decision components to optimize and classify issue descriptions, using issue description response results to guide the orchestration of bug fix agent workflows. SIADAFIX adaptively selects three repair modes, i.e., easy, middle and hard mode, based on problem complexity. It employs fast generalization for simple problems and test-time scaling techniques for complex problems. Experimental results on the SWE-bench Lite show that the proposed method achieves 60.67% pass@1 performance using the Claude-4 Sonnet model, reaching state-of-the-art levels among all open-source methods. SIADAFIX effectively balances repair efficiency and accuracy, providing new insights for automated program repair.

Many studies have linked procrastination to poor academic performance and well-being. Procrastination is especially detrimental for advanced students when facing large, complex programming assignments in upper-year courses. We designed an intervention to combat academic procrastination on such programming assignments. The intervention consisted of early deadlines that were not worth marks but provided additional automated feedback if students submitted their work early. We evaluated the intervention by comparing the behaviour and performance of students between a control group and an intervention group. Our results showed that the intervention encouraged significantly more students to start the assignments early. Although there was no significant difference in students' grades between the control and intervention groups, students within the intervention group who used the intervention achieved significantly higher grades than those who did not. Our results implied that starting early alone did not improve students' grades. However, starting early and receiving additional feedback enhanced the students' grades relative to those of the rest of the students. We also conducted semi-structured interviews to gain an understanding of students' perceptions of the intervention. The interviews revealed that students benefited from the intervention in numerous ways, including improved academic performance, mental health, and development of soft skills. Students adopted the intervention to get more feedback, satisfy their curiosity, or use their available time. The main reasons for not adopting the intervention include having other competing deadlines, the intervention not being worth any marks, and feeling confident about their work.</p></details> | 8 pages. 3 Tables |

We contribute a novel type of benchmark evaluating the inductive reasoning capabilities of LLMs that is inspired by the forward reconstruction task from historical linguistics but is formulated in an extremely simple, general way (in the form of Programming by Examples). The task involves generating a cascade of simple string rewrite programs to transform a given list of input strings into a list of desired output strings. We present a fully automated pipeline that programmatically generates problems of this type with controllable difficulty, enabling scalable evaluation of reasoning models while avoiding contamination. Using this approach, we construct two benchmarks: PBEBench-Lite, which efficiently stratifies models of varying capabilities, and PBEBench, which requires models to induce programs similar in complexity to those constructed by historical linguists. Our experiments reveal a substantial performance gap between models that leverage test-time compute or LCoT (long chain-of-thought) reasoning and those that do not. Moreover, although recent models show promise, the solve rate for both of them drops below 5% for hard instances of the PBEBench dataset (ground truth cascade lengths of 20 and 30, respectively), falling well short of realistic historical linguistics requirements even with computationally expensive, popular scaling techniques from the PBE and reasoning literature. Additionally, we also study the effectiveness of different scaling strategies and the impact of various hyperparameters on the difficulty of the generated data using gpt-oss-120b, the best-performing open-source model.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimization Modulo Integer Linear-Exponential Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14550v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the first study of the complexity of the optimization problem for integer linear-exponential programs which extend classical integer linear programs with the exponential function $x \mapsto 2^x$ and the remainder function ${(x,y) \mapsto (x \bmod 2^y)}$. The problem of deciding if such a program has a solution was recently shown to be NP-complete in [Chistikov et al., ICALP'24]. The optimization problem instead asks for a solution that maximizes (or minimizes) a linear-exponential objective function, subject to the constraints of an integer linear-exponential program. We establish the following results: 1. If an optimal solution exists, then one of them can be succinctly represented as an integer linear-exponential straight-line program (ILESLP): an arithmetic circuit whose gates always output an integer value (by construction) and implement the operations of addition, exponentiation, and multiplication by rational numbers. 2. There is an algorithm that runs in polynomial time, given access to an integer factoring oracle, which determines whether an ILESLP encodes a solution to an integer linear-exponential program. This algorithm can also be used to compare the values taken by the objective function on two given solutions. Building on these results, we place the optimization problem for integer linear-exponential programs within an extension of the optimization class $\text{NPO}$ that lies within $\text{FNP}^{\text{NP}}$. In essence, this extension forgoes determining the optimal solution via binary search.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of a SODA 2026 paper</p></details> |

While AI-based systems offer scalable and immediate help, their responses can occasionally be inaccurate or insufficient. Human instructors, in contrast, may bring more valuable expertise but are limited in time and availability. To address these limitations, we present a hybrid help framework that integrates AI-generated hints with an escalation mechanism, allowing students to request feedback from instructors when AI support falls short. This design leverages the strengths of AI for scale and responsiveness while reserving instructor effort for moments of greatest need. We deployed this tool in a data science programming course with 82 students. We observe that out of the total 673 AI-generated hints, students rated 146 (22%) as unhelpful. Among those, only 16 (11%) of the cases were escalated to the instructors. A qualitative investigation of instructor responses showed that those feedback instances were incorrect or insufficient roughly half of the time. This finding suggests that when AI support fails, even instructors with expertise may need to pay greater attention to avoid making mistakes. We will publicly release the tool for broader adoption and enable further studies in other classrooms. Our work contributes a practical approach to scaling high-quality support and informs future efforts to effectively integrate AI and humans in education.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of the SIGCSE'26 paper</p></details> |

This article outlines the foundation of an automated translation tool for NWS products, powered by artificial intelligence. The NWS has partnered with LILT, whose patented training process enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt neural machine translation (NMT) tools for weather terminology and messaging. Designed for scalability across Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and National Centers, the system is currently being developed in Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese, and other widely spoken non-English languages. Rooted in best practices for multilingual risk communication, the system provides accurate, timely, and culturally relevant translations, significantly reducing manual translation time and easing operational workloads across the NWS. To guide the distribution of these products, GIS mapping was used to identify language needs across different NWS regions, helping prioritize resources for the communities that need them most. We also integrated ethical AI practices throughout the program's design, ensuring that transparency, fairness, and human oversight guide how automated translations are created, evaluated, and shared with the public. This work has culminated into a website featuring experimental multilingual NWS products, including translated warnings, 7-day forecasts, and educational campaigns, bringing the country one step closer to a national warning system that reaches all Americans.</p></details> |  |
| **[PathFix: Automated Program Repair with Expected Path](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14341v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) techniques are effective in fixing inevitable defects in software, enhancing development efficiency and software robustness. However, due to the difficulty of generating precise specifications, existing APR methods face two main challenges: generating too many plausible patch candidates and overfitting them to partial test cases. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a new APR method named PathFix, which leverages path-sensitive constraints extracted from correct execution paths to generate patches for repairing buggy code. It is based on one observation: if a buggy program is repairable, at least one expected path is supposed to replace the fault path in the patched program. PathFix operates in four main steps. First, it traces fault paths reaching the fault output in the buggy program. Second, it derives expected paths by analyzing the desired correct output on the control flow graph, where an expected path defines how a feasible patch leads to the correct execution. Third, PathFix generates and evaluates patches by solving state constraints along the expected path. Fourth, we validate the correctness of the generated patch. To further enhance repair performance and mitigate scalability issues introduced by path-sensitive analysis, we integrate a large language model (LLM) into our framework. Experimental results show that PathFix outperforms existing solutions, particularly in handling complex program structures such as loops and recursion.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's version of a paper accepted at SecDev 2025 (IEEE)</p></details> |
| **[A Systematic Study of Time Limit Exceeded Errors in Online Programming Assignments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14339v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online programming platforms such as Codeforces and LeetCode attract millions of users seeking to learn to program or refine their skills for industry interviews. A major challenge for these users is the Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) error, triggered when a program exceeds the execution time bound. Although designed as a performance safeguard, TLE errors are difficult to resolve: error messages provide no diagnostic insight, platform support is minimal, and existing debugging tools offer little help. As a result, many users abandon their submissions after repeated TLE failures. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of TLE errors in online programming. We manually analyzed 1000 Codeforces submissions with TLE errors, classified their root causes, and traced how users attempted to fix them. Our analysis shows that TLE errors often arise not only from inefficient algorithms but also from infinite loops, improper data structure use, and inefficient I/O, challenging the conventional view that TLEs are purely performance issues. Guided by these findings, we introduce Nettle, the first automated repair tool specifically designed for TLE errors, and Nettle-Eval, the first framework for evaluating TLE repairs. Integrating LLMs with targeted automated feedback generated by the compiler and test cases, Nettle produces small, correct code edits that eliminate TLEs while preserving functionality. Evaluated on the same 1000 real-world cases, Nettle achieves a 98.5% fix rate, far exceeding the strongest LLM baseline, and all of its repairs pass both Nettle-Eval and the platform's official checker, confirming the reliability of our framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-ERM: Sample-Efficient Program Learning via LLM-Guided Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14331v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We seek algorithms for program learning that are both sample-efficient and computationally feasible. Classical results show that targets admitting short program descriptions (e.g., with short ``python code'') can be learned with a ``small'' number of examples (scaling with the size of the code) via length-first program enumeration, but the search is exponential in description length. Consequently, Gradient-based training avoids this cost yet can require exponentially many samples on certain short-program families. To address this gap, we introduce LLM-ERM, a propose-and-verify framework that replaces exhaustive enumeration with an LLM-guided search over candidate programs while retaining ERM-style selection on held-out data. Specifically, we draw $k$ candidates with a pretrained reasoning-augmented LLM, compile and check each on the data, and return the best verified hypothesis, with no feedback, adaptivity, or gradients. Theoretically, we show that coordinate-wise online mini-batch SGD requires many samples to learn certain short programs. {\em Empirically, LLM-ERM solves tasks such as parity variants, pattern matching, and primality testing with as few as 200 samples, while SGD-trained transformers overfit even with 100,000 samples}. These results indicate that language-guided program synthesis recovers much of the statistical efficiency of finite-class ERM while remaining computationally tractable, offering a practical route to learning succinct hypotheses beyond the reach of gradient-based training.</p></details> |  |

Column generation iterates between solving a master problem and a pricing problem. The master problem is a linear program, which can be solved using a generic solver. The pricing problem is highly dependent on the application but is usually discrete. Due to the difficulty of discrete optimization, high-performance column generation often relies on a custom pricing algorithm built specifically to exploit the problem's structure. This bespoke nature of the pricing solver prevents the reuse of components for other applications. We show that domain-independent dynamic programming, a software package for modeling and solving arbitrary dynamic programs, can be used as a generic pricing solver. We develop basic implementations of branch-and-price with pricing by domain-independent dynamic programming and show that they outperform a world-leading solver on static mixed integer programming formulations for seven problem classes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to INFORMS Journal on Computing didp-rs code: https://github.com/domain-independent-dp/didp-rs/releases/tag/labeling Model code: https://github.com/Kurorororo/didp-column-generation</p></details> |

We propose domain-independent dynamic programming (DIDP), a novel model-based paradigm based on dynamic programming (DP). While DP is not new, it has typically been implemented as a problem-specific method. We introduce Dynamic Programming Description Language (DyPDL), a formalism to define DP models based on a state transition system, inspired by artificial intelligence (AI) planning. we show that heuristic search algorithms can be used to solve DyPDL models and propose seven DIDP solvers. We experimentally compare our DIDP solvers with commercial MIP and CP solvers (solving MIP and CP models, respectively) on common benchmark instances of eleven combinatorial optimization problem classes. We show that DIDP outperforms MIP in nine problem classes, CP also in nine problem classes, and both MIP and CP in seven. DIDP also achieves superior performance to existing state-based solvers including domain-independent AI planners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

With DNNs characterized by a prolonged sequence of nonlinear propagation, determining their optimal parameters given an objective naturally fits within the framework of Optimal Control Programming. Such an interpretation of DNNs as dynamical systems has proven crucial in offering a theoretical foundation for principled analysis from numerical equations to physics. In parallel to these theoretical pursuits, this paper focuses on an algorithmic perspective. Our motivated observation is the striking algorithmic resemblance between the Backpropagation algorithm for computing gradients in DNNs and the optimality conditions for dynamical systems, expressed through another backward process known as dynamic programming. Consolidating this connection, where Backpropagation admits a variational structure, solving an approximate dynamic programming up to the first-order expansion leads to a new class of optimization methods exploring higher-order expansions of the Bellman equation. The resulting optimizer, termed Optimal Control Theoretic Neural Optimizer (OCNOpt), enables rich algorithmic opportunities, including layer-wise feedback policies, game-theoretic applications, and higher-order training of continuous-time models such as Neural ODEs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCNOpt improves upon existing methods in robustness and efficiency while maintaining manageable computational complexity, paving new avenues for principled algorithmic design grounded in dynamical systems and optimal control theory.</p></details> |  |

In our paper we investigate the emerging Vibe Coding (VC) paradigm that emphasizes intuitive, affect-driven, and improvisational interactions between developers and AI systems. Building upon the discourse of End-User Development (EUD), we explore how VC diverges from conventional programming approaches such as those supported by tools like GitHub Copilot. Through five semi-structured interview sessions with ten experienced software practitioners, we identify five thematic dimensions: creativity, sustainability, the future of programming, collaboration, and criticism. Our analysis conceptualizes VC within the metaphor of co-drifting, contrasting it with the prevalent co-piloting perspective of AI-assisted development. We argue that VC reconfigures the developers role, blurring boundaries between professional and non-developers. While VC enables novel forms of expression and rapid prototyping, it also introduces challenges regarding reproducibility, scalability, and inclusivity. We propose that VC represents a meaningful shift in programming culture, warranting further investigation within human-computer interaction (HCI) and software engineering research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop Contribution at the sixth decennial Aarhus conference in "The End of Programming (as we know it) - Envisioning Radical Re-Conceptualizations of Co-Coding with AI"</p></details> |

We explore to what extent this latent correction capability extends to Automated Program Repair (APR) by investigating Round-Trip Translation (RTT): translating code from one programming language into another programming or natural language and back, using Large Language Models (LLMs). We hypothesize that RTT restores patterns most commonly seen in the LLM's training corpora through regression toward the mean, replacing infrequent bugs with more frequent, natural, bug-free code. To test this hypothesis, we employ nine LLMs and four common APR benchmarks in Java, and perform a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of RTT-generated patches. We find that RTT through English generates plausible patches for 100 of 164 bugs with GPT-4 on the HumanEval-Java benchmark, and 97 are found to be correct in our manual assessment. Moreover, RTT uniquely generates plausible patches for 46 bugs that were missed by LLMs specifically fine-tuned for APR. While this demonstrates the viability of RTT for APR, we also observe limitations, such as a lower overall bug fix rate than the state-of-the-art and diluting the original coding style. We analyze the impact of these limitations and discuss the potential of using RTT as a complementary component in APR frameworks.

The critical seed chaining step must connect exact k-mer matches between reads and reference genomes while filtering spurious matches, yet state-of-the-art methods rely on fixed gap penalty functions unable to adapt to varying genomic contexts including tandem repeats and structural variants. This paper presents RawHash3, a hybrid framework combining graph neural networks with classical dynamic programming for adaptive seed chaining that maintains real-time performance while providing statistical guarantees. We formalize seed chaining as graph learning where seeds constitute nodes with 12-dimensional feature vectors and edges encode 8-dimensional spatial relationships including gap consistency. Our architecture employs three-layer EdgeConv GNN with confidence-based method selection that dynamically switches between learned guidance and algorithmic fallback. Comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 synthetic nanopore reads with 5,200 test seeds demonstrates RawHash3 achieves 99.94 percent precision and 40.07 percent recall, representing statistically significant 25.0 percent relative improvement over baseline with p less than 0.001. The system maintains median inference latency of 1.59ms meeting real-time constraints, while demonstrating superior robustness with 100 percent success rate under 20 percent label corruption versus baseline degradation to 30.3 percent.

Now, this is not a technical detailing of these components, rather, I attempt to provide an overview as I myself have lacked during my time investigating programming languages. Thus, read this as an introduction to the magical world of extensibility. Through a literature review, I identify key extensibility themes - Macros, Modules, Types, and Reflection - highlighting diverse strategies for fostering extensibility. The analysis extends to cross-theme properties such as Parametricism and First-class citizen behaviour, introducing layers of complexity by highlighting the importance of customizability and flexibility in programming language constructs. By outlining these facets of existing programming languages and research, I aim to inspire future language designers to assess and consider the extensibility of their creations critically.</p></details> |  |
| **[Behavioral Embeddings of Programs: A Quasi-Dynamic Approach for Optimization Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13158v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning effective numerical representations, or embeddings, of programs is a fundamental prerequisite for applying machine learning to automate and enhance compiler optimization. Prevailing paradigms, however, present a dilemma. Static representations, derived from source code or intermediate representation (IR), are efficient and deterministic but offer limited insight into how a program will behave or evolve under complex code transformations. Conversely, dynamic representations, which rely on runtime profiling, provide profound insights into performance bottlenecks but are often impractical for large-scale tasks due to prohibitive overhead and inherent non-determinism. This paper transcends this trade-off by proposing a novel quasi-dynamic framework for program representation. The core insight is to model a program's optimization sensitivity. We introduce the Program Behavior Spectrum, a new representation generated by probing a program's IR with a diverse set of optimization sequences and quantifying the resulting changes in its static features. To effectively encode this high-dimensional, continuous spectrum, we pioneer a compositional learning approach. Product Quantization is employed to discretize the continuous reaction vectors into structured, compositional sub-words. Subsequently, a multi-task Transformer model, termed PQ-BERT, is pre-trained to learn the deep contextual grammar of these behavioral codes. Comprehensive experiments on two representative compiler optimization tasks -- Best Pass Prediction and -Oz Benefit Prediction -- demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art static baselines.

In this work, we introduce FINDER, a novel two-step framework, to enhance LLMs' capabilities in financial numerical reasoning. The first step utilizes a generative retriever to extract relevant facts from unstructured data, including both text and tables. This is followed by context-aware Program of Thought prompting with dynamic selection of in-context examples.

This paper provides the first average-case analysis of exact regularization: with a standard Gaussian cost vector and fixed constraint set, bounds are established for the probability that exact regularization succeeds as a function of regularization strength. Failure is characterized via the Gaussian measure of inner cones, controlled by novel two-sided bounds on the measure of shifted cones. Results reveal dimension-dependent scaling laws and connect exact regularization of linear programs to their polyhedral geometry via the normal fan and the Gaussian (solid-angle) measure of its cones. Computable bounds are obtained in several canonical settings, including regularized optimal transport. Numerical experiments corroborate the predicted scalings and thresholds.</p></details> | 25 pages, 4 figures |

| **[Constraint Matters: Multi-Modal Representation for Reducing Mixed-Integer Linear programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.18742v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Model reduction, which aims to learn a simpler model of the original mixed integer linear programming (MILP), can solve large-scale MILP problems much faster. Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction, which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation time by 17.47\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Since...</summary><p>Since the article needs improvement, it will be temporarily withdrawn</p></details> |
| **[CoLF Logic Programming as Infinitary Proof Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12302v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical Frameworks such as Automath [de Bruijn, 1968] or LF [Harper et al., 1993] were originally conceived as metalanguages for the specification of foundationally uncommitted deductive systems, yielding generic proof checkers. Their high level of abstraction was soon exploited to also express algorithms over deductive systems such as theorem provers, type-checkers, evaluators, compilers, proof transformers, etc. in the paradigm of computation-as-proof-construction. This has been realized in languages such as $\lambda$-Prolog [Miller et al., 1991] or Elf [Pfenning, 1991] based on backward chaining, and LolliMon [Lopez et al., 2005] or Celf [Schack-Nielsen and Schuermann, 2008], which integrated forward chaining. None of these early frameworks supported the direct expression of infinitary objects or proofs, which are available in the recently developed CoLF$^\omega$ [Chen, 2023]. In this work-in-progress report, we sketch an approach to computation-as-proof-construction over the first-order fragment of CoLF$^\omega$ (called CoLF$^\omega_1$ ) that already includes infinitary objects and proofs. A key idea is the interpretation of logic variables as communication channels and computation as concurrent message-passing. This is realized in a concrete compiler from CoLF$^\omega_1$ to Sax, a proof-theoretically inspired parallel programming language based on the proof-reduction in the semi-axiomatic sequent calculus [DeYoung et al., 2020].</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings LFMTP 2025, arXiv:2510.11199</p></details> |

In this paper, we introduce a novel Gradient-Guided Diffusion-based Optimization framework, termed GGDOpt, which tackles CCP through three key innovations. First, GGDOpt accommodates a broad class of CCP problems without requiring the knowledge of the exact distribution of uncertainty-relying solely on a set of samples. Second, to address the nonconvexity of the chance constraints, it reformulates the CCP as a sampling problem over the product of two distributions: an unknown data distribution supported on a nonconvex set and a Boltzmann distribution defined by the objective function, which fully leverages both first- and second-order gradient information. Third, GGDOpt has theoretical convergence guarantees and provides practical error bounds under mild assumptions. By progressively injecting noise during the forward diffusion process to convexify the nonconvex feasible region, GGDOpt enables guided reverse sampling to generate asymptotically optimal solutions. Experimental results on synthetic datasets and a waveform design task in wireless communications demonstrate that GGDOpt outperforms existing methods in both solution quality and stability with nearly 80% overhead reduction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatically Generating Questions About Scratch Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11658v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When learning to program, students are usually assessed based on the code they wrote. However, the mere completion of a programming task does not guarantee actual comprehension of the underlying concepts. Asking learners questions about the code they wrote has therefore been proposed as a means to assess program comprehension. As creating targeted questions for individual student programs can be tedious and challenging, prior work has proposed to generate such questions automatically. In this paper we generalize this idea to the block-based programming language Scratch. We propose a set of 30 different questions for Scratch code covering an established program comprehension model, and extend the LitterBox static analysis tool to automatically generate corresponding questions for a given Scratch program. On a dataset of 600,913 projects we generated 54,118,694 questions automatically. Our initial experiments with 34 ninth graders demonstrate that this approach can indeed generate meaningful questions for Scratch programs, and we find that the ability of students to answer these questions on their programs relates to their overall performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CompEd 2025</p></details> |

While prior works have focused on prompt design and code generation quality, the broader impact of LLM-driven development on the iterative dynamics of software engineering remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct large-scale experiments on thousands of algorithmic programming tasks and hundreds of framework selection tasks to systematically investigate how AI-assisted programming interacts with the software ecosystem. Our analysis reveals \textbf{a striking Matthew effect: the more popular a programming language or framework, the higher the success rate of LLM-generated code}. The phenomenon suggests that AI systems may reinforce existing popularity hierarchies, accelerating convergence around dominant tools while hindering diversity and innovation. We provide a quantitative characterization of this effect and discuss its implications for the future evolution of programming ecosystems.</p></details> |  |

| **[DebugTA: An LLM-Based Agent for Simplifying Debugging and Teaching in Programming Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11076v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In programming education, Debugging and Teaching (DT) task is a common scenario where students receive assistance in correcting their erroneous code. The task involves multiple inputs, including erroneous code, error messages, reference solutions, and the question description, with the goal of generating modification suggestions to the erroneous code. However, two key challenges hinder the effectiveness of existing approaches. Firstly, the complexity and heterogeneity of inputs inherent in DT tasks significantly elevate the reasoning challenges faced by LLMs. Second, existing approaches often fail to fully leverage the availability of standard code in DT tasks, forcing models to rely solely on complex multi-step reasoning, which limits the potential of LLMs in addressing DT tasks effectively. To address these challenges, we propose DebugTA, a novel LLM-based debugging and teaching agent with specialized tools for standard code retrieval, variable substitution to align reference code, and an external compiler for real-time code analysis. Guided by explicit pedagogical and debugging principles, DebugTA acts as an agent that decomposes a complex task into sequential LLM interactions, each utilizing distinct tools for specific subtasks, thereby simplifying the logical reasoning at each step and reducing overall reasoning complexity. Furthermore, DebugTA utilizes tool calls to align the standard code with the erroneous code as much as possible, allowing the LLM to focus on logic errors within the erroneous code and improving the accuracy of the generated suggestions. To rigorously assess the quality of modification suggestions, we introduce a student simulator-teacher interaction paradigm. Experimental results on three real-world code datasets demonstrate that DebugTA consistently improves teaching effectiveness while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Gender Stereotypes in Scratch Programming Tutorials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11064v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gender stereotypes in introductory programming courses often go unnoticed, yet they can negatively influence young learners' interest and learning, particularly under-represented groups such as girls. Popular tutorials on block-based programming with Scratch may unintentionally reinforce biases through character choices, narrative framing, or activity types. Educators currently lack support in identifying and addressing such bias. With large language models~(LLMs) increasingly used to generate teaching materials, this problem is potentially exacerbated by LLMs trained on biased datasets. However, LLMs also offer an opportunity to address this issue. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs for automatically identifying gender-stereotypical elements in Scratch tutorials, thus offering feedback on how to improve teaching content. We develop a framework for assessing gender bias considering characters, content, instructions, and programming concepts. Analogous to how code analysis tools provide feedback on code in terms of code smells, we operationalise this framework using an automated tool chain that identifies *gender stereotype smells*. Evaluation on 73 popular Scratch tutorials from leading educational platforms demonstrates that stereotype smells are common in practice. LLMs are not effective at detecting them, but our gender bias evaluation framework can guide LLMs in generating tutorials with fewer stereotype smells.</p></details> | Koli Calling 2025 |

Generating realistic scenes with varied object poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet scenes.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Learning to Guarantee Type Correctness in Code Generation through Type-Guided Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10216v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models have shown remarkable proficiency in code generation; nevertheless, ensuring type correctness remains a challenge. Although traditional methods, such as constrained decoding, alleviate this problem by externally rejecting untypable code, the model itself does not effectively learn type reasoning internally, which ultimately limits its overall performance. This paper introduces TyFlow, a novel system that internalizes type reasoning within code generation to guide the model to learn the type system. The core of our approach is a novel type-guided program synthesis system that maintains an isomorphism between type derivation trees and synthesis derivation trees, enabling a new code representation based on synthesis decision sequences rather than traditional text-based token sequences. By offloading the complexity of type system learning to the representation itself, models can redirect their computational resources toward higher-level program semantics. Our evaluation shows that TyFlow not only eliminates type errors but also significantly improves functional correctness, highlighting the importance of aligning LMs with type systems internally.</p></details> |  |
| **[End-to-end Compositional Verification of Program Safety through Verified and Verifying Compilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10015v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program safety (i.e., absence of undefined behaviors) is critical for correct operation of computer systems. It is usually verified at the source level (e.g., by separation logics) and preserved to the target by verified compilers (e.g., CompCert), thereby achieving end-to-end verification of safety. However, modern safe programming languages like Rust pose new problems in achieving end-to-end safety. Because not all functionalities can be implemented in the safe language, mixing safe and unsafe modules is needed. Therefore, verified compilation must preserve a modular notion of safety which can be composed at the target level. Furthermore, certain classes of errors (e.g., memory errors) are automatically excluded by verifying compilation (e.g., borrow checking) for modules written in safe languages. As a result, verified compilation needs to cooperate with verifying compilation to ensure end-to-end safety. To address the above problems, we propose a modular and generic definition of safety called open safety based on program semantics described as open labeled transition systems (LTS). Open safety is composable at the boundary of modules and can be modularly preserved by verified compositional compilation. Those properties enable separate verification of safety for heterogeneous modules and composition of the safety results at the target level. Open safety can be generalized to partial safety (i.e., only a certain class of errors can occur). By this we formalized the correctness of verifying compilation as derivation of total safety from partial safety. We demonstrate how our framework can combine verified and verifying compilation by developing a verified compiler for an ownership language (called Owlang) inspired by Rust. We evaluate our approach on the compositional safety verification using a hash map implemented by Owlang and C.</p></details> |  |
| **[Remote Interference Mitigation through Null Precoding and Fractional Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09989v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid deployment of 5G systems, remote interference (RI) caused by atmospheric ducting has emerged as an occasional, but critical challenge. This phenomenon occurs when the downlink (DL) signals from distant base stations (BSs) propagate over long distances through tropospheric ducting, severely disrupting uplink (UL) reception at local BSs. To address this challenge, we analyze the effect of RI on network performance, including the channel estimation phase. We then develop a solution that identifies the angle-of-arrival (AOA) estimation of RI and designs precoders and combiners that mitigate RI. Our approach employs interference cancellation techniques through null precoding and fractional programming which enhance the performance of the network. Interestingly, we show that using our scheme, uplink communication is possible at low transmit power regimes that were unusable due to RI. Our results further show a 5.23~dB reduction in normalized mean square error for channel estimation and achieved data rates around 5.8~bit/s/Hz at the previously unusable low uplink transmit power conditions.</p></details> |  |

Examples from statistics and probability theory demonstrate how dependent type theory and an algebraic perspective can unify the theoretical and computational concerns of statistics, ensuring rigorous, machine-checked proofs and executable software.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Multilingual Python Programming Language](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09591v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>All widely used and useful programming languages have a common problem.

The lack of knowledge of English poses a major hurdle to many newcomers who do not have the resources, in terms of time and money, to learn the English language. Studies show that people learn better in their own language. Therefore, we propose a language transpiler built on top of the Python programming language, called UniversalPython, which allows one to write Python in their own human language. We demonstrate the ability to create an "Urdu Python" with this transpiler. In the future, we aim to scale the language to encapsulate more human languages to increase the availability of programming.

| **[Enabling Population-Level Parallelism in Tree-Based Genetic Programming for GPU Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17168v5)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tree-based Genetic Programming (TGP) is a widely used evolutionary algorithm for tasks such as symbolic regression, classification, and robotic control. Due to the intensive computational demands of running TGP, GPU acceleration is crucial for achieving scalable performance. However, efficient GPU-based execution of TGP remains challenging, primarily due to three core issues: (1) the structural heterogeneity of program individuals, (2) the complexity of integrating multiple levels of parallelism, and (3) the incompatibility between high-performance CUDA execution and flexible Python-based environments. To address these issues, we propose EvoGP, a high-performance framework tailored for GPU acceleration of TGP via population-level parallel execution. First, EvoGP introduces a tensorized representation that encodes variable-sized trees into fixed-shape, memory-aligned arrays, enabling uniform memory access and parallel computation across diverse individuals. Second, EvoGP adopts an adaptive parallelism strategy that dynamically combines intra- and inter-individual parallelism based on dataset size, ensuring high GPU utilization across a broad spectrum of tasks. Third, EvoGP embeds custom CUDA kernels into the PyTorch runtime, achieving seamless integration with Python-based environments such as Gym, MuJoCo, Brax, and Genesis. Experiments show that EvoGP attains a peak throughput exceeding $10^{11}$ GPops/s, with speedups of up to $528\times$ over GPU-based TGP implementations and $18\times$ over the fastest CPU-based libraries, while maintaining comparable accuracy and improved scalability across large population sizes. EvoGP is open source and accessible at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/evogp.</p></details> |  |

To address these limitations, this paper formalizes sequence variables within CP. Unlike the classical successor models, this computational domain handle optional visits and support insertion heuristics, including insertion-based Large Neighborhood Search. We provide a clear definition of their domain, update operations, and introduce consistency levels for constraints on this domain. An implementation is described with the underlying data structures required for integrating sequence variables into existing trail-based CP solvers. Furthermore, global constraints specifically designed for sequence variables and vehicle routing are introduced. Finally, the effectiveness of sequence variables is demonstrated by simplifying problem modeling and achieving competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride Problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Herb.jl: A Unifying Program Synthesis Library](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09726v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program synthesis -- the automatic generation of code given a specification -- is one of the most fundamental tasks in artificial intelligence (AI) and many programmers' dream. Numerous synthesizers have been developed to tackle program synthesis, manifesting different ideas to approach the exponentially growing program space. While numerous smart program synthesis tools exist, reusing and remixing previously developed methods is tedious and time-consuming. We propose Herb.jl, a unifying program synthesis library written in the Julia programming language, to address these issues. Since current methods rely on similar building blocks, we aim to modularize the underlying synthesis algorithm into communicating and fully extendable sub-compartments, allowing for straightforward reapplication of these modules. To demonstrate the benefits of using Herb.jl, we show three common use cases: 1. how to implement a simple problem and grammar, and how to solve it, 2. how to implement a previously developed synthesizer with just a few lines of code, and 3. how to run a synthesizer against a benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Obfuscation of Unitary Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11970v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program obfuscation aims to hide the inner workings of a program while preserving its functionality. In the quantum setting, recent works have obtained obfuscation schemes for specialized classes of quantum circuits. For instance, Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2024) constructed a quantum state obfuscation scheme, which supports the obfuscation of quantum programs represented as quantum states for pseudo-deterministic quantum programs with classical inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model. In this work, we improve upon existing results by constructing the first quantum state obfuscation scheme for unitary (or approximately unitary) quantum programs supporting quantum inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model. At the core of our obfuscation scheme are two novel ingredients: a functional quantum authentication scheme that allows key holders to learn specific functions of the authenticated quantum state with simulation-based security, and a compiler that represents an arbitrary quantum circuit as a projective linear-plus-measurement quantum program described by a sequence of non-adaptive Clifford gates interleaved with adaptive and compatible measurements.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces vibe coding, an emerging AI-native programming paradigm in which a developer specifies high-level functional intent along with qualitative descriptors of the desired "vibe" (tone, style, or emotional resonance). An intelligent agent then transforms those specifications into executable software. We formalize the definition of vibe coding and propose a reference architecture that includes an intent parser, a semantic embedding engine, an agentic code generator, and an interactive feedback loop. A hypothetical implementation is described. We compare vibe coding with declarative, functional, and prompt-based programming, and we discuss its implications for software engineering, human-AI collaboration, and responsible AI practice. Finally, we examine reported productivity gains and democratizing effects, review recent studies that highlight vulnerabilities and potential slowdowns, identify key challenges such as alignment, reproducibility, bias, explainability, maintainability, and security, and outline future directions and open research questions.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 1 figure, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[Adaptive Sparsification for Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08348v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a generic framework for solving linear programs (LPs) with many constraints $(n \gg d)$ via adaptive sparsification. Our approach provides a principled generalization of the techniques of [Assadi '23] from matching problems to general LPs and robustifies [Clarkson's '95] celebrated algorithm for the exact setting. The framework reduces LP solving to a sequence of calls to a ``low-violation oracle'' on small, adaptively sampled subproblems, which we analyze through the lens of the multiplicative weight update method. Our main results demonstrate the versatility of this paradigm. First, we present a quantum version of Clarkson's algorithm that finds an exact solution to an LP using $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n} d^3)$ row-queries to the constraint matrix. This is achieved by accelerating the classical bottleneck (the search for violated constraints) with a generalization of Grover search, decoupling the quantum component from the classical solver. Second, our framework yields new state-of-the-art algorithms for mixed packing and covering problems when the packing constraints are ``simple''. By retaining all packing constraints while sampling only from the covering constraints, we achieve a significant width reduction, leading to faster solvers in both the classical and quantum query models. Our work provides a modular and powerful approach for accelerating LP solvers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concept-Based Generic Programming in C++](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08969v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present programming techniques to illustrate the facilities and principles of C++ generic programming using concepts. Concepts are C++'s way to express constraints on generic code. As an initial example, we provide a simple type system that eliminates narrowing conversions and provides range checking without unnecessary notational or run-time overheads. Concepts are used throughout to provide user-defined extensions to the type system. The aim is to show their utility and the fundamental ideas behind them, rather than to provide a detailed or complete explanation of C++'s language support for generic programming or the extensive support provided by the standard library. Generic programming is an integral part of C++, rather than an isolated sub-language. In particular, key facilities support general programming as well as generic programming (e.g., uniform notation for types, lambdas, variadic templates, and C++26 static reflection). Finally, we give design rationales and origins for key parts of the concept design, including use patterns, the relationship to Object-Oriented Programming, value arguments, notation, concept type-matching, and definition checking.</p></details> |  |
| **[PDCS: A Primal-Dual Large-Scale Conic Programming Solver with GPU Enhancements](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00311v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce the Primal-Dual Conic Programming Solver (PDCS), a large-scale conic programming solver with GPU enhancements. Problems that PDCS currently supports include linear programs, second-order cone programs, convex quadratic programs, and exponential cone programs. PDCS achieves scalability to large-scale problems by leveraging sparse matrix-vector multiplication as its core computational operation, which is both memory-efficient and well-suited for GPU acceleration. The solver is based on the restarted primal-dual hybrid gradient method but further incorporates several enhancements, including adaptive reflected Halpern restarts, adaptive step-size selection, adaptive weight adjustment, and diagonal rescaling. Additionally, PDCS employs a bijection-based method to compute projections onto rescaled cones. Furthermore, cuPDCS is a GPU implementation of PDCS and it implements customized computational schemes that utilize different levels of GPU architecture to handle cones of different types and sizes. Numerical experiments demonstrate that cuPDCS is generally more efficient than state-of-the-art commercial solvers and other first-order methods on large-scale conic program applications, including Fisher market equilibrium problems, Lasso regression, and multi-period portfolio optimization. Furthermore, cuPDCS also exhibits better scalability, efficiency, and robustness compared to other first-order methods on the conic program benchmark dataset CBLIB. These advantages are more pronounced in large-scale, lower-accuracy settings.</p></details> | 48 pages, 8 figures |

According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trustworthy AI. In this context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP), Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming(CP).Our contributions include the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling with the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental study that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw some perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model into a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.</p></details> |  |

However, complete relational logics for classical-quantum programs, which combine classical and quantum computations and operate over classical as well as quantum variables, have remained out of reach. The main gap is that while prior duality theorems could readily be derived using optimal transport and semidefinite programming methods, respectively, the combined setting falls out of the scope of these methods and requires new ideas. In this paper, we overcome this gap and establish the desired duality theorem for classical-quantum states. Our argument relies critically on a novel dimension-independent analysis of the convex optimization problem underlying the finite-dimensional quantum setting, which, in particular, allows us to take the limit where the classical state space becomes infinite. Using the resulting duality theorem, we establish soundness and completeness of a new relational program logic, called $\mathsf{cqOTL}$, for classical-quantum programs. In addition, we lift prior restrictions on the completeness of two existing program logics: $\mathsf{eRHL}$ for probabilistic programs (Avanzini et al., POPL 2025) and $\mathsf{qOTL}$ for quantum programs (Barthe et al., LICS 2025).</p></details> | <details><summary>63 pa...</summary><p>63 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Toward Causal-Visual Programming: Enhancing Agentic Reasoning in Low-Code Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25282v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 table |
| **[Automated Program Repair of Uncompilable Student Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06187v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A significant portion of student programming submissions in CS1 learning environments are uncompilable, limiting their use in student modeling and downstream knowledge tracing. Traditional modeling pipelines often exclude these cases, discarding observations of student learning. This study investigates automated program repair as a strategy to recover uncompilable code while preserving students' structural intent for use in student modeling. Within this framework, we assess large language models (LLMs) as repair agents, including GPT-5 (OpenAI), Claude 3.5 Haiku (Anthropic), and Gemini 2.5 Flash (Google), under high- and low-context prompting conditions. Repairs were evaluated for compilability, edit distance, and preservation of students' original structure and logic. We find that while all three LLMs are capable of producing compilable repairs, their behavior diverges in how well they preserve students' control flow and code structure, which affects their pedagogical utility. By recovering uncompilable submissions, this work enables richer and more comprehensive analyses of learners' coding processes and development over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[ConstraintLLM: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Industrial-Level Constraint Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05774v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constraint programming (CP) is a crucial technology for solving real-world constraint optimization problems (COPs), with the advantages of rich modeling semantics and high solving efficiency. Using large language models (LLMs) to generate formal modeling automatically for COPs is becoming a promising approach, which aims to build trustworthy neuro-symbolic AI with the help of symbolic solvers. However, CP has received less attention compared to works based on operations research (OR) models. We introduce ConstraintLLM, the first LLM specifically designed for CP modeling, which is trained on an open-source LLM with multi-instruction supervised fine-tuning. We propose the Constraint-Aware Retrieval Module (CARM) to increase the in-context learning capabilities, which is integrated in a Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) framework with guided self-correction mechanism. Moreover, we construct and release IndusCP, the first industrial-level benchmark for CP modeling, which contains 140 challenging tasks from various domains. Our experiments demonstrate that ConstraintLLM achieves state-of-the-art solving accuracy across multiple benchmarks and outperforms the baselines by 2x on the new IndusCP benchmark.

| **[PLSemanticsBench: Large Language Models As Programming Language Interpreters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03415v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) excel at code reasoning, a natural question arises: can an LLM execute programs (i.e., act as an interpreter) purely based on a programming language's formal semantics? If so, it will enable rapid prototyping of new programming languages and language features. We study this question using the imperative language IMP (a subset of C), formalized via small-step operational semantics (SOS) and rewriting-based operational semantics (K-semantics). We introduce three evaluation sets-Human-Written, LLM-Translated, and Fuzzer- Generated-whose difficulty is controlled by code-complexity metrics spanning the size, control-flow, and data-flow axes. Given a program and its semantics formalized with SOS/K-semantics, models are evaluated on three tasks ranging from coarse to fine: (1) final-state prediction, (2) semantic rule prediction, and (3) execution trace prediction. To distinguish pretraining memorization from semantic competence, we define two nonstandard semantics obtained through systematic mutations of the standard rules. Across strong code/reasoning LLMs, performance drops under nonstandard semantics despite high performance under the standard one. We further find that (i) there are patterns to different model failures, (ii) most reasoning models perform exceptionally well on coarse grained tasks involving reasoning about highly complex programs often containing nested loop depths beyond five, and surprisingly, (iii) providing formal semantics helps on simple programs but often hurts on more complex ones. Overall, the results show a promise that LLMs could serve as programming language interpreters, but points to the lack of their robust semantics understanding. We release the benchmark and the supporting code at https://github.com/EngineeringSoftware/PLSemanticsBench.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Student Choice and the Use of Multimodal Generative AI in Programming Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05417v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The broad adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) is impacting Computer Science education, and recent studies found its benefits and potential concerns when students use it for programming learning. However, most existing explorations focus on GenAI tools that primarily support text-to-text interaction. With recent developments, GenAI applications have begun supporting multiple modes of communication, known as multimodality. In this work, we explored how undergraduate programming novices choose and work with multimodal GenAI tools, and their criteria for choices. We selected a commercially available multimodal GenAI platform for interaction, as it supports multiple input and output modalities, including text, audio, image upload, and real-time screen-sharing. Through 16 think-aloud sessions that combined participant observation with follow-up semi-structured interviews, we investigated student modality choices for GenAI tools when completing programming problems and the underlying criteria for modality selections. With multimodal communication emerging as the future of AI in education, this work aims to spark continued exploration on understanding student interaction with multimodal GenAI in the context of CS education.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, accepted to SIGCSE2026</p></details> |
| **[Modeling Student Learning with 3.8 Million Program Traces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05056v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As programmers write code, they often edit and retry multiple times, creating rich "interaction traces" that reveal how they approach coding tasks and provide clues about their level of skill development. For novice programmers in particular, these traces reflect the diverse reasoning processes they employ to code, such as exploratory behavior to understand how a programming concept works, re-strategizing in response to bugs, and personalizing stylistic choices. In this work, we explore what can be learned from training language models on such reasoning traces: not just about code, but about coders, and particularly students learning to program. We introduce a dataset of over 3.8 million programming reasoning traces from users of Pencil Code, a free online educational platform used by students to learn simple programming concepts. Compared to models trained only on final programs or synthetically-generated traces, we find that models trained on real traces are stronger at modeling diverse student behavior. Through both behavioral and probing analyses, we also find that many properties of code traces, such as goal backtracking or number of comments, can be predicted from learned representations of the students who write them. Building on this result, we show that we can help students recover from mistakes by steering code generation models to identify a sequence of edits that will results in more correct code while remaining close to the original student's style. Together, our results suggest that many properties of code are properties of individual students and that training on edit traces can lead to models that are more steerable, more predictive of student behavior while programming, and better at generating programs in their final states.

A multi-stage stochastic programming approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04965v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a multi-stage stochastic programming model for the optimal participation of energy communities in electricity markets. The multi-stage aspect captures the different times at which variable renewable generation and electricity prices are observed. This results in large-scale optimization problem instances containing large scenario trees with 34 stages, to which scenario reduction techniques are applied. Case studies with real data are discussed to analyse proposed regulatory frameworks in Europe. The added value of considering stochasticity is also analysed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v4)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16x on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |

For that, it examines the design and implementation of a Digital Wallet system developed in Kotlin (for OOP) and Scala (for FP). The comparison is made through a mixed-method approach. The self-ethnographic qualitative analysis provides a side-by-side comparison of both implementations, revealing the perspective of those writing such code. The survey-based quantitative analysis gathers feedback from developers with diverse backgrounds, showing their impressions of those reading this code. Hopefully, these results may be useful for developers seeking to decide which paradigm is best suited for their next project.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 15 figures (1 table, 3 diagrams, 4 graphics, 7 listings), accepted to the CTICQS capstone project competition at SBQS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Program Synthesis Benchmark for Visual Programming in XLogoOnline Environment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11334v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language and multimodal models have shown remarkable success on various benchmarks focused on specific skills such as general-purpose programming, math word problem-solving, and visual question answering. However, it is unclear how well these models perform on tasks that require a combination of these skills. In this paper, we curate a novel program synthesis benchmark based on the real-world tasks in the XLogoOnline visual programming environment. Each task requires a combination of different skills such as spatial planning, basic programming, and logical reasoning. Our evaluation shows that current state-of-the-art models like GPT-4V and Llama3-70B struggle to solve these tasks, achieving only 20% and 2.35% success rates, respectively. Next, we develop a fine-tuning pipeline to boost the performance of models by leveraging a large-scale synthetic training dataset with over 80,000 tasks. Moreover, we showcase how emulator-driven feedback can be used to design a curriculum over training data distribution, through which a fine-tuned Llama3-8B drastically outperforms GPT-4V and Llama3-70B models. Finally, we provide an in-depth failure analysis to understand the limitations of different models. We will publicly release the benchmark for future research on program synthesis in visual programming.</p></details> | ACL'25 paper |
