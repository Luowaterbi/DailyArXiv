Current research is hindered by redundant generation results and a tendency to overfit local patterns in the short term. Although existing studies attempt to alleviate the issue by adopting a multi-token prediction strategy, there remains limited focus on choosing the appropriate processing length for generations. By analyzing the attention between tokens during the generation process of LLMs, it can be observed that the high spikes of the attention scores typically appear at the end of lines. This insight suggests that it is reasonable to treat each line of code as a fundamental processing unit and generate them sequentially. Inspired by this, we propose the \textbf{LSR-MCTS} algorithm, which leverages MCTS to determine the code line-by-line and select the optimal path. Further, we integrate a self-refine mechanism at each node to enhance diversity and generate higher-quality programs through error correction. Extensive experiments and comprehensive analyses on three public coding benchmarks demonstrate that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art performance approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Malicious Source Code in PyPI Packages with LLMs: Does RAG Come in Handy?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13769v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malicious software packages in open-source ecosystems, such as PyPI, pose growing security risks. Unlike traditional vulnerabilities, these packages are intentionally designed to deceive users, making detection challenging due to evolving attack methods and the lack of structured datasets. In this work, we empirically evaluate the effectiveness of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and few-shot learning for detecting malicious source code. We fine-tune LLMs on curated datasets and integrate YARA rules, GitHub Security Advisories, and malicious code snippets with the aim of enhancing classification accuracy. We came across a counterintuitive outcome: While RAG is expected to boost up the prediction performance, it fails in the performed evaluation, obtaining a mediocre accuracy. In contrast, few-shot learning is more effective as it significantly improves the detection of malicious code, achieving 97% accuracy and 95% balanced accuracy, outperforming traditional RAG approaches. Thus, future work should expand structured knowledge bases, refine retrieval models, and explore hybrid AI-driven cybersecurity solutions.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been peer-reviewed and accepted for publication to the 29th International Conference on Evaluation and Assessment in Software Engineering (EASE 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Systematic Bernoulli Generator Matrix Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13731v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper is concerned with the systematic Bernoulli generator matrix~(BGM) codes, which have been proved to be capacity-achieving over binary-input output-symmetric~(BIOS) channels in terms of bit-error rate~(BER). We prove that the systematic BGM codes are also capacity-achieving over BIOS channels in terms of frame-error rate (FER). To this end, we present a new framework to prove the coding theorems for binary linear codes. Different from the widely-accepted approach via ensemble enlargement, the proof directly applies to the systematic binary linear codes. The new proof indicates that the pair-wise independence condition is not necessary for proving the binary linear code ensemble to achieve the capacity of the BIOS channel. The Bernoulli parity-check~(BPC) codes, which fall within the framework of the systematic BGM codes with parity-check bits known at the decoder can also be proved to achieve the capacity. The presented framework also reveals a new mechanism pertained to the systematic linear codes that the systematic bits and the corresponding parity-check bits play different roles. Precisely, the noisy systematic bits are used to limit the list size of candidate codewords, while the noisy parity-check bits are used to select from the list the maximum likelihood codeword. For systematic BGM codes with finite length, we derive the lower bounds on the BER and FER, which can be used to predict the error floors. Numerical results show that the systematic BGM codes match well with the derived error floors. The performance in water-fall region can be improved with approaches in statistical physics and the error floors can be significantly improved by implementing the concatenated codes with the systematic BGM codes as the inner codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Trace Gadgets: Minimizing Code Context for Machine Learning-Based Vulnerability Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13676v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the number of web applications and API endpoints exposed to the Internet continues to grow, so does the number of exploitable vulnerabilities. Manually identifying such vulnerabilities is tedious. Meanwhile, static security scanners tend to produce many false positives. While machine learning-based approaches are promising, they typically perform well only in scenarios where training and test data are closely related. A key challenge for ML-based vulnerability detection is providing suitable and concise code context, as excessively long contexts negatively affect the code comprehension capabilities of machine learning models, particularly smaller ones. This work introduces Trace Gadgets, a novel code representation that minimizes code context by removing non-related code. Trace Gadgets precisely capture the statements that cover the path to the vulnerability. As input for ML models, Trace Gadgets provide a minimal but complete context, thereby improving the detection performance. Moreover, we collect a large-scale dataset generated from real-world applications with manually curated labels to further improve the performance of ML-based vulnerability detectors. Our results show that state-of-the-art machine learning models perform best when using Trace Gadgets compared to previous code representations, surpassing the detection capabilities of industry-standard static scanners such as GitHub's CodeQL by at least 4% on a fully unseen dataset. By applying our framework to real-world applications, we identify and report previously unknown vulnerabilities in widely deployed software.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Prompt Patterns Affect Code Quality? A First Empirical Assessment of ChatGPT-Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13656v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have rapidly transformed software development, especially in code generation. However, their inconsistent performance, prone to hallucinations and quality issues, complicates program comprehension and hinders maintainability. Research indicates that prompt engineering-the practice of designing inputs to direct LLMs toward generating relevant outputs-may help address these challenges. In this regard, researchers have introduced prompt patterns, structured templates intended to guide users in formulating their requests. However, the influence of prompt patterns on code quality has yet to be thoroughly investigated. An improved understanding of this relationship would be essential to advancing our collective knowledge on how to effectively use LLMs for code generation, thereby enhancing their understandability in contemporary software development. This paper empirically investigates the impact of prompt patterns on code quality, specifically maintainability, security, and reliability, using the Dev-GPT dataset. Results show that Zero-Shot prompting is most common, followed by Zero-Shot with Chain-of-Thought and Few-Shot. Analysis of 7583 code files across quality metrics revealed minimal issues, with Kruskal-Wallis tests indicating no significant differences among patterns, suggesting that prompt structure may not substantially impact these quality metrics in ChatGPT-assisted code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Capacity-achieving sparse superposition codes with spatially coupled VAMP decoder](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13601v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sparse superposition (SS) codes provide an efficient communication scheme over the Gaussian channel, utilizing the vector approximate message passing (VAMP) decoder for rotational invariant design matrices. Previous work has established that the VAMP decoder for SS achieves Shannon capacity when the design matrix satisfies a specific spectral criterion and exponential decay power allocation is used. In this work, we propose a spatially coupled VAMP (SC-VAMP) decoder for SS with spatially coupled design matrices. Based on state evolution (SE) analysis, we demonstrate that the SC-VAMP decoder is capacity-achieving when the design matrices satisfy the spectra criterion. Empirically, we show that the SC-VAMP decoder outperforms the VAMP decoder with exponential decay power allocation, achieving a lower section error rate. All codes are available on https://github.com/yztfu/SC-VAMP-for-Superposition-Code.git.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Multilingual Sentiment Analysis with Explainability for Sinhala, English, and Code-Mixed Content](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13545v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Sentiment analysis is crucial for brand reputation management in the banking sector, where customer feedback spans English, Sinhala, Singlish, and code-mixed text. Existing models struggle with low-resource languages like Sinhala and lack interpretability for practical use. This research develops a hybrid aspect-based sentiment analysis framework that enhances multilingual capabilities with explainable outputs. Using cleaned banking customer reviews, we fine-tune XLM-RoBERTa for Sinhala and code-mixed text, integrate domain-specific lexicon correction, and employ BERT-base-uncased for English. The system classifies sentiment (positive, neutral, negative) with confidence scores, while SHAP and LIME improve interpretability by providing real-time sentiment explanations. Experimental results show that our approaches outperform traditional transformer-based classifiers, achieving 92.3 percent accuracy and an F1-score of 0.89 in English and 88.4 percent in Sinhala and code-mixed content. An explainability analysis reveals key sentiment drivers, improving trust and transparency. A user-friendly interface delivers aspect-wise sentiment insights, ensuring accessibility for businesses. This research contributes to robust, transparent sentiment analysis for financial applications by bridging gaps in multilingual, low-resource NLP and explainability.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 6 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[PennyLang: Pioneering LLM-Based Quantum Code Generation with a Novel PennyLane-Centric Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02497v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) offer remarkable capabilities in code generation, natural language processing, and domain-specific reasoning. However, their application in quantum software development remains underexplored, particularly for PennyLane-a leading framework for hybrid quantum-classical computing. To address this gap, we introduce a novel, high-quality dataset comprising 3,347 PennyLane-specific quantum code samples and contextual descriptions, specifically curated to support LLM training and fine-tuning for quantum code assistance. Our contributions are threefold: (1) the automatic construction and open-source release of a comprehensive PennyLane dataset derived from textbooks, official documentation, and open-source repositories; (2) a structured methodology for data curation, annotation, and formatting to enhance LLM usability and relevance; and (3) a rigorous evaluation of code generation capabilities using both baseline Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and a GraphRAG-enhanced pipeline. Using the PennyLang framework, we demonstrate that GraphRAG, when applied to a GPT-4o Mini model, substantially outperforms standard prompting and baseline RAG. Accuracy improves from 20.5% (without RAG) to 58.2% with GraphRAG, showcasing its effectiveness in reducing hallucinations and improving code correctness in quantum programming tasks. Compared to prior efforts focused largely on Qiskit, our work expands LLM-based assistance to the PennyLane ecosystem, contributing practical tools and reproducible methodologies for advancing AI-assisted quantum software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 7 figures, 7 tables, submitted for review under QCE 2025</p></details> |
| **[CodeVisionary: An Agent-based Framework for Evaluating Large Language Models in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13472v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in code generation, underscoring the critical need for rigorous and comprehensive evaluation. Existing evaluation approaches fall into three categories, including human-centered, metric-based, and LLM-based. Considering that human-centered approaches are labour-intensive and metric-based ones overly rely on reference answers, LLM-based approaches are gaining increasing attention due to their stronger contextual understanding capabilities and superior efficiency. However, the performance of LLM-based approaches remains limited due to: (1) lack of multisource domain knowledge, and (2) insufficient comprehension of complex code. To mitigate the limitations, we propose CodeVisionary, the first LLM-based agent framework for evaluating LLMs in code generation. CodeVisionary consists of two stages: (1) Multiscore knowledge analysis stage, which aims to gather multisource and comprehensive domain knowledge by formulating and executing a stepwise evaluation plan. (2) Negotiation-based scoring stage, which involves multiple judges engaging in discussions to better comprehend the complex code and reach a consensus on the evaluation score. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CodeVisionary achieves the best performance for evaluating LLMs in code generation, outperforming the best baseline methods with average improvements of 0.202, 0.139, and 0.117 in Pearson, Spearman, and Kendall-Tau coefficients, respectively. Besides, CodeVisionary provides detailed evaluation reports, which assist developers in identifying shortcomings and making improvements. The resources of CodeVisionary are available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/CodeVisionary.</p></details> |  |
| **[DocAgent: A Multi-Agent System for Automated Code Documentation Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08725v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-quality code documentation is crucial for software development especially in the era of AI. However, generating it automatically using Large Language Models (LLMs) remains challenging, as existing approaches often produce incomplete, unhelpful, or factually incorrect outputs. We introduce DocAgent, a novel multi-agent collaborative system using topological code processing for incremental context building. Specialized agents (Reader, Searcher, Writer, Verifier, Orchestrator) then collaboratively generate documentation. We also propose a multi-faceted evaluation framework assessing Completeness, Helpfulness, and Truthfulness. Comprehensive experiments show DocAgent significantly outperforms baselines consistently. Our ablation study confirms the vital role of the topological processing order. DocAgent offers a robust approach for reliable code documentation generation in complex and proprietary repositories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Public Repo: https://github.com/facebookresearch/DocAgent</p></details> |
| **[Quantifying the benefits of code hints for refactoring deprecated Java APIs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08041v3)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When done manually, refactoring legacy code in order to eliminate uses of deprecated APIs is an error-prone and time-consuming process. In this paper, we investigate to which degree refactorings for deprecated Java APIs can be automated, and quantify the benefit of Javadoc code hints for this task. To this end, we build a symbolic and a neural engine for the automatic refactoring of deprecated APIs. The former is based on type-directed and component-based program synthesis, whereas the latter uses LLMs. We applied our engines to refactor the deprecated methods in the Oracle JDK 15. Our experiments show that code hints are enabling for the automation of this task: even the worst engine correctly refactors 71% of the tasks with code hints, which drops to at best 14% on tasks without. Adding more code hints to Javadoc can hence boost the refactoring of code that uses deprecated APIs.</p></details> |  |

However, incorporating cryptosystems into dynamic controllers significantly increases the computational load. This paper aims to provide an accessible guideline for running encrypted controllers using an open-source library Lattigo, which supports an efficient implementation of Ring-Learing With Errors (LWE) based encrypted controllers, and our explanations are assisted with example codes that are fully available at https://github.com/CDSL-EncryptedControl/CDSL.</p></details> | 6 pages |
| **[Improved Decoding Algorithm of BD-LRPC Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.13381v1)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A Bounded-Degree Low-Rank Parity-Check (BD-LRPC) code is a rank-metric code that admits a parity-check matrix whose support is generated by a set of powers of an element. This specific structure of the parity-check matrix was employed to enhance the first phase of the decoding algorithm through the expansion of the syndrome support. However, this expansion decreases the probability of recovering the error support in the second phase of the decoding algorithm. This paper introduces a novel method based on successive intersections to recover the error support. This method offers two key advantages: it increases the probability of successful decoding and enables the decoding of a greater number of errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Natural Language Outlines for Code: Literate Programming in the LLM Era](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.04820v4)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose using natural language outlines as a novel modality and interaction surface for providing AI assistance to developers throughout the software development process. An NL outline for a code function comprises multiple statements written in concise prose, which partition the code and summarize its main ideas in the style of literate programming. Crucially, we find that modern LLMs can generate accurate and high-quality NL outlines in practice. Moreover, NL outlines enable a bidirectional sync between code and NL, where a developer can change either code or NL and have the LLM automatically update the other. We discuss many use cases for NL outlines: they can accelerate understanding and navigation of code and diffs, simplify code maintenance, augment code search, steer code generation, and more. We then propose and compare multiple LLM prompting techniques for generating outlines and ask professional developers to judge outline quality. Finally, we present two case studies applying NL outlines toward code review and malware detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to FSE'25 Industry Track</p></details> |
| **[Towards Translating Real-World Code with LLMs: A Study of Translating to Rust](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11514v3)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) show promise in code translation - the task of translating code written in one programming language to another language - due to their ability to write code in most programming languages. However, LLM's effectiveness on translating real-world code remains largely unstudied. In this work, we perform the first substantial study on LLM-based translation to Rust by assessing the ability of five state-of-the-art LLMs, GPT4, Claude 3, Claude 2.1, Gemini Pro, and Mixtral. We conduct our study on code extracted from real-world open source projects. To enable our study, we develop FLOURINE, an end-to-end code translation tool that uses differential fuzzing to check if a Rust translation is I/O equivalent to the original source program, eliminating the need for pre-existing test cases. As part of our investigation, we assess both the LLM's ability to produce an initially successful translation, as well as their capacity to fix a previously generated buggy one. If the original and the translated programs are not I/O equivalent, we apply a set of automated feedback strategies, including feedback to the LLM with counterexamples. Our results show that the most successful LLM can translate 47% of our benchmarks, and also provides insights into next steps for improvements.</p></details> | 12 pages, 12 figures |
| **[A Coding-Theoretic Analysis of Hyperspherical Prototypical Learning Geometry](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07664v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspherical Prototypical Learning (HPL) is a supervised approach to representation learning that designs class prototypes on the unit hypersphere. The prototypes bias the representations to class separation in a scale invariant and known geometry. Previous approaches to HPL have either of the following shortcomings: (i) they follow an unprincipled optimisation procedure; or (ii) they are theoretically sound, but are constrained to only one possible latent dimension. In this paper, we address both shortcomings. To address (i), we present a principled optimisation procedure whose solution we show is optimal. To address (ii), we construct well-separated prototypes in a wide range of dimensions using linear block codes. Additionally, we give a full characterisation of the optimal prototype placement in terms of achievable and converse bounds, showing that our proposed methods are near-optimal.</p></details> | <details><summary>Chang...</summary><p>Changes in version 2: Minor formatting changes.

| **[Unexpected but informative: What fixation-related potentials tell us about the processing of confusing program code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.10099v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As software pervades more and more areas of our professional and personal lives, there is an ever-increasing need to maintain software, and for programmers to be able to efficiently write and understand program code. In the first study of its kind, we analyze fixation-related potentials (FRPs) to explore the online processing of program code patterns that are ambiguous to programmers, but not the computer (so-called atoms of confusion), and their underlying neurocognitive mechanisms in an ecologically valid setting. Relative to unambiguous counterparts in program code, atoms of confusion elicit a late frontal positivity with a duration of about 400 to 700 ms after first looking at the atom of confusion. As the frontal positivity shows high resemblance with an event-related potential (ERP) component found during natural language processing that is elicited by unexpected but plausible words in sentence context, we take these data to suggest that the brain engages similar neurocognitive mechanisms in response to unexpected and informative inputs in program code and in natural language. In both domains, these inputs lead to an update of a comprehender's situation model that is essential for information extraction from a quickly unfolding input.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pandora: A Code-Driven Large Language Model Agent for Unified Reasoning Across Diverse Structured Knowledge](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12734v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unified Structured Knowledge Reasoning (USKR) aims to answer natural language questions (NLQs) by using structured sources such as tables, databases, and knowledge graphs in a unified way. Existing USKR methods either rely on employing task-specific strategies or custom-defined representations, which struggle to leverage the knowledge transfer between different SKR tasks or align with the prior of LLMs, thereby limiting their performance. This paper proposes a novel USKR framework named \textsc{Pandora}, which takes advantage of \textsc{Python}'s \textsc{Pandas} API to construct a unified knowledge representation for alignment with LLM pre-training. It employs an LLM to generate textual reasoning steps and executable Python code for each question. Demonstrations are drawn from a memory of training examples that cover various SKR tasks, facilitating knowledge transfer. Extensive experiments on four benchmarks involving three SKR tasks demonstrate that \textsc{Pandora} outperforms existing unified frameworks and competes effectively with task-specific methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Malicious Code Detection in Smart Contracts via Opcode Vectorization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12720v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the booming development of blockchain technology, smart contracts have been widely used in finance, supply chain, Internet of things and other fields in recent years. However, the security problems of smart contracts become increasingly prominent. Security events caused by smart contracts occur frequently, and the existence of malicious codes may lead to the loss of user assets and system crash. In this paper, a simple study is carried out on malicious code detection of intelligent contracts based on machine learning. The main research work and achievements are as follows: Feature extraction and vectorization of smart contract are the first step to detect malicious code of smart contract by using machine learning method, and feature processing has an important impact on detection results. In this paper, an opcode vectorization method based on smart contract text is adopted. Based on considering the structural characteristics of contract opcodes, the opcodes are classified and simplified. Then, N-Gram (N=2) algorithm and TF-IDF algorithm are used to convert the simplified opcodes into vectors, and then put into the machine learning model for training. In contrast, N-Gram algorithm and TF-IDF algorithm are directly used to quantify opcodes and put into the machine learning model training. Judging which feature extraction method is better according to the training results. Finally, the classifier chain is applied to the intelligent contract malicious code detection.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Vector Quantized Graph Autoencoder with Annealing-Based Code Selection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12715v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Graph self-supervised learning has gained significant attention recently. However, many existing approaches heavily depend on perturbations, and inappropriate perturbations may corrupt the graph's inherent information. The Vector Quantized Variational Autoencoder (VQ-VAE) is a powerful autoencoder extensively used in fields such as computer vision; however, its application to graph data remains underexplored. In this paper, we provide an empirical analysis of vector quantization in the context of graph autoencoders, demonstrating its significant enhancement of the model's capacity to capture graph topology. Furthermore, we identify two key challenges associated with vector quantization when applying in graph data: codebook underutilization and codebook space sparsity. For the first challenge, we propose an annealing-based encoding strategy that promotes broad code utilization in the early stages of training, gradually shifting focus toward the most effective codes as training progresses. For the second challenge, we introduce a hierarchical two-layer codebook that captures relationships between embeddings through clustering. The second layer codebook links similar codes, encouraging the model to learn closer embeddings for nodes with similar features and structural topology in the graph. Our proposed model outperforms 16 representative baseline methods in self-supervised link prediction and node classification tasks across multiple datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[Data-efficient LLM Fine-tuning for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12687v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated significant potential in code generation tasks. However, there remains a performance gap between open-source and closed-source models. To address this gap, existing approaches typically generate large amounts of synthetic data for fine-tuning, which often leads to inefficient training. In this work, we propose a data selection strategy in order to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of training for code-based LLMs. By prioritizing data complexity and ensuring that the sampled subset aligns with the distribution of the original dataset, our sampling strategy effectively selects high-quality data. Additionally, we optimize the tokenization process through a "dynamic pack" technique, which minimizes padding tokens and reduces computational resource consumption. Experimental results show that when training on 40% of the OSS-Instruct dataset, the DeepSeek-Coder-Base-6.7B model achieves an average performance of 66.9%, surpassing the 66.1% performance with the full dataset. Moreover, training time is reduced from 47 minutes to 34 minutes, and the peak GPU memory decreases from 61.47 GB to 42.72 GB during a single epoch. Similar improvements are observed with the CodeLlama-Python-7B model on the Evol-Instruct dataset. By optimizing both data selection and tokenization, our approach not only improves model performance but also improves training efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2408.02193</p></details> |
| **[Code Copycat Conundrum: Demystifying Repetition in LLM-based Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12608v1)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation, the quality of LLM-generated code still faces significant challenges. One significant issue is code repetition, which refers to the model's tendency to generate structurally redundant code, resulting in inefficiencies and reduced readability. To address this, we conduct the first empirical study to investigate the prevalence and nature of repetition across 19 state-of-the-art code LLMs using three widely-used benchmarks. Our study includes both quantitative and qualitative analyses, revealing that repetition is pervasive and manifests at various granularities and extents, including character, statement, and block levels. We further summarize a taxonomy of 20 repetition patterns. Building on our findings, we propose DeRep, a rule-based technique designed to detect and mitigate repetition in generated code. We evaluate DeRep using both open-source benchmarks and in an industrial setting. Our results demonstrate that DeRep significantly outperforms baselines in reducing repetition (with an average improvements of 91.3%, 93.5%, and 79.9% in rep-3, rep-line, and sim-line metrics) and enhancing code quality (with a Pass@1 increase of 208.3% over greedy search). Furthermore, integrating DeRep improves the performance of existing repetition mitigation methods, with Pass@1 improvements ranging from 53.7% to 215.7%.</p></details> |  |

We obtain the complete weight enumerators MacWilliams identity and the symmetrized weight enumerators MacWilliams identity based on the theory of theta function. We extend the main work by Bannai, Dougherty, Harada and Oura to the finite ring $\mathbb{Z}_k$ for any positive integer $k$ and present the complete weight enumerators MacWilliams identity in genus $g$. When $k=p$ is a prime number, we establish the relationship between the theta function of associated lattices over a cyclotomic field and the complete weight enumerators with Hamming weight of codes, which is an analogy of the results by G. Van der Geer and F. Hirzebruch since they showed the identity with the Lee weight enumerators.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code Improvement Practices at Meta](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12517v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The focus on rapid software delivery inevitably results in the accumulation of technical debt, which, in turn, affects quality and slows future development. Yet, companies with a long history of rapid delivery exist. Our primary aim is to discover how such companies manage to keep their codebases maintainable. Method: we investigate Meta's practices by collaborating with engineers on code quality and by analyzing rich source code change history to reveal a range of practices used for continual improvement of the codebase. In addition, we replicate several aspects of previous industry cases studies investigating the impact of code reengineering. Results: Code improvements at Meta range from completely organic grass-roots done at the initiative of individual engineers, to regularly blocked time and engagement via gamification of Better Engineering (BE) work, to major explicit initiatives aimed at reengineering the complex parts of the codebase or deleting accumulations of dead code. Over 14% of changes are explicitly devoted to code improvement and the developers are given ``badges'' to acknowledge the type of work and the amount of effort. Our investigation to prioritize which parts of the codebase to improve lead to the development of metrics to guide this decision making. Our analysis of the impact of reengineering activities revealed substantial improvements in quality and speed as well as a reduction in code complexity. Overall, such continual improvement is an effective way to develop software with rapid releases, while maintaining high quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kernels for Storage Capacity and Dual Index Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12274v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The storage capacity of a graph measures the maximum amount of information that can be stored across its vertices, such that the information at any vertex can be recovered from the information stored at its neighborhood. The study of this graph quantity is motivated by applications in distributed storage and by its intimate relations to the index coding problem from the area of network information theory. In the latter, one wishes to minimize the amount of information that has to be transmitted to a collection of receivers, in a way that enables each of them to discover its required data using some prior side information. In this paper, we initiate the study of the Storage Capacity and Index Coding problems from the perspective of parameterized complexity. We prove that the Storage Capacity problem parameterized by the solution size admits a kernelization algorithm producing kernels of linear size. We also provide such a result for the Index Coding problem, in the linear and non-linear settings, where it is parameterized by the dual value of the solution, i.e., the length of the transmission that can be saved using the side information. A key ingredient in the proofs is the crown decomposition technique due to Chor, Fellows, and Juedes (WG 2003, WG 2004). As an application, we significantly extend an algorithmic result of Dau, Skachek, and Chee (IEEE Trans. Inform. Theory, 2014).</p></details> | 15 pages |
| **[Coding-Prior Guided Diffusion Network for Video Deblurring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12222v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While recent video deblurring methods have advanced significantly, they often overlook two valuable prior information: (1) motion vectors (MVs) and coding residuals (CRs) from video codecs, which provide efficient inter-frame alignment cues, and (2) the rich real-world knowledge embedded in pre-trained diffusion generative models. We present CPGDNet, a novel two-stage framework that effectively leverages both coding priors and generative diffusion priors for high-quality deblurring. First, our coding-prior feature propagation (CPFP) module utilizes MVs for efficient frame alignment and CRs to generate attention masks, addressing motion inaccuracies and texture variations. Second, a coding-prior controlled generation (CPC) module network integrates coding priors into a pretrained diffusion model, guiding it to enhance critical regions and synthesize realistic details. Experiments demonstrate our method achieves state-of-the-art perceptual quality with up to 30% improvement in IQA metrics. Both the code and the codingprior-augmented dataset will be open-sourced.</p></details> |  |

Nevertheless, this paper challenges the conventional JSCC paradigm, and advocates for adoption of Separate Source Channel Coding (SSCC) to enjoy the underlying more degree of freedom for optimization. We demonstrate that SSCC, after leveraging the strengths of Large Language Model (LLM) for source coding and Error Correction Code Transformer (ECCT) complemented for channel decoding, offers superior performance over JSCC. Our proposed framework also effectively highlights the compatibility challenges between SemCom approaches and digital communication systems, particularly concerning the resource costs associated with the transmission of high precision floating point numbers. Through comprehensive evaluations, we establish that empowered by LLM-based compression and ECCT-enhanced error correction, SSCC remains a viable and effective solution for modern communication systems. In other words, separate source and channel coding is still what we need!</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in deep learning have improved homography estimation, particularly with unsupervised learning approaches, offering increased robustness and generalizability. However, accurately predicting homography, especially in complex motions, remains a challenge. In response, this work introduces a novel method leveraging video coding, particularly by harnessing inherent motion vectors (MVs) present in videos. We present CodingHomo, an unsupervised framework for homography estimation. Our framework features a Mask-Guided Fusion (MGF) module that identifies and utilizes beneficial features among the MVs, thereby enhancing the accuracy of homography prediction. Additionally, the Mask-Guided Homography Estimation (MGHE) module is presented for eliminating undesired features in the coarse-to-fine homography refinement process. CodingHomo outperforms existing state-of-the-art unsupervised methods, delivering good robustness and generalizability.

| **[Overlapping Error Correction Codes on Two-Dimensional Structures](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12142v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for highly reliable communication systems drives the research and development of algorithms that identify and correct errors during data transmission and storage. This need becomes even more critical in hard-to-access or sensitive systems, such as those used in space applications, passenger transportation, and the financial sector. In this context, Error Correction Codes (ECCs) are essential tools for ensuring a certain level of reliability. This work proposes a technique to enhance ECC error correction capability by overlapping data regions. The approach consists of protecting the same data area with multiple ECCs organized in a two-dimensional structure, enabling logical inferences that correlate the codes and improve their error detection and correction capabilities. More specifically, the overlapping is characterized by the organization of multiple ECCs, whose intersection exclusively covers the entire data region. Different configurations of overlapping ECCs were analyzed to evaluate the proposal regarding error detection and correction capability, scalability, and reliability. Experimental results confirm the technique's effectiveness and demonstrate its high scalability potential, reducing the need for redundancy bits relative to the number of data bits. Furthermore, comparisons with state-of-the-art ECC approaches indicate the technique's applicability in critical systems that require high reliability.</p></details> |  |

Recently, the first infinite family of Euclidean self-dual binary and nonbinary cyclic codes, whose minimum distances have a square-root lower bound and have a lower bound better than square-root lower bounds are constructed in \cite{Chen23} for the lengths of these codes being unbounded. Let $q$ be a power of a prime number and $Q=q^2$. In this paper, we first improve the lower bounds on the minimum distances of Euclidean and Hermitian duals of BCH codes with length $\frac{q^m-1}{q^s-1}$ over $\mathbb{F}_q$ and $\frac{Q^m-1}{Q-1}$ over $\mathbb{F}_Q$ in \cite{Fan23,GDL21,Wang24} for the designed distances in some ranges, respectively, where $\frac{m}{s}\geq 3$. Then based on matrix-product construction and some lower bounds on the minimum distances of BCH codes and their duals, we obtain several classes of Euclidean and Hermitian self-dual codes, whose minimum distances have square-root lower bounds or a square-root-like lower bounds. Our lower bounds on the minimum distances of Euclidean and Hermitian self-dual cyclic codes improved many results in \cite{Chen23}. In addition, our lower bounds on the minimum distances of the duals of BCH codes are almost $q^s-1$ or $q$ times that of the existing lower bounds.</p></details> | <details><summary>29 pa...</summary><p>29 pages, submitted to IEEE</p></details> |

Comparisons with Dynamic SC Flip (DSCF) and SC Perturbation (SCP) are carried out since the proposed DSCF and Perturbation (DSCFP) and Perturbed DSCF (PDSCF) algorithms combine both methods. The analysis includes comparisons with several code lengths $N$ and various number of decoding attempts $T_{max}$. For $N=1024$ and the coding rate $R=\frac{1}{2}$, the DSCFP and the SCP algorithms with $T_{max}=17$ are bested by approximately $0.1$\,dB at block error rate (BLER) of $0.001$. At $\text{BLER}=10^{-6}$ and for $T_{max}=64$, the gain is of $0.375$ dB and $>0.5$ dB with respect to DSCF and SCP, respectively. At high signal-to-noise ratio, the average computational complexity of the proposed algorithms is virtually equivalent to that of SC.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 9 figures, 1 table.

| **[Generalized Restart Mechanism for Successive-Cancellation Flip Decoding of Polar Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.12071v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Polar codes are a class of linear error-correction codes that have received a lot of attention due to their ability to achieve channel capacity in an arbitrary binary discrete memoryless channel (B-DMC) with low-complexity successive-cancellation (SC) decoding. However, practical implementations often require better error-correction performance than what SC decoding provides, particularly at short to moderate code lengths. Successive-cancellation flip (SCF) decoding algorithm was proposed to improve error-correction performance with an aim to detect and correct the first wrongly estimated bit in a codeword before resuming SC decoding. At each additional SC decoding trial, i.e., decoding attempt beyond the initial unsuccessful trial, one bit estimated as the least reliable is flipped. Dynamic SCF (DSCF) is a variation of SCF, where multiple bits may be flipped simultaneously per trial. Despite the improved error-correction performance compared to the SC decoder, SCF-based decoders have variable execution time, which leads to high average execution time and latency. In this work, we propose the generalized restart mechanism (GRM) that allows to skip decoding computations that are identical between the initial trial and any additional trial. Under DSCF decoding with up to 3-bit flips per decoding trial, our proposed GRM is shown to reduce the average execution time by 25% to 60% without any negative effect on error-correction performance. The proposed mechanism is adaptable to state-of-the-art latency-reduction techniques. When applied to Fast-DSCF-3 decoding, the additional reduction brought by the GRM is 15% to 22%. For the DSCF-3 decoder, the proposed mechanism requires approximately 4% additional memory.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted in Journal of Signal Processing Systems, 21 pages, 8 figures, 6 tables</p></details> |

We derive an explicit Wedderburn-like decomposition of finite split metacyclic group algebras over fields with characteristic coprime to the group order. Utilizing this decomposition, we develop a systematic theory of metacyclic codes, providing their algebraic description and proving that they can be viewed as generalized concatenated codes with cyclic inner codes and skew quasi-cyclic outer codes. We establish bounds on the minimum distance of metacyclic codes and investigate the class of induced codes. Furthermore, we show the feasibility of constructing a partial key-recovery attack against certain McEliece-type cryptosystems based on metacyclic codes by exploiting their generalized concatenated structure.</p></details> |  |
| **[Puncturing Quantum Stabilizer Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.17754v3)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Classical coding theory contains several techniques to obtain new codes from other codes, including puncturing and shortening. For quantum codes, a form of puncturing is known, but its description is based on the code space rather than its generators. In this work, we generalize the puncturing procedure to allow more freedom in the choice of which coded states are kept and which are removed. We describe this puncturing by focusing on the stabilizer matrix containing the generators of the code. In this way, we are able to explicitly describe the stabilizer matrix of the punctured code given the stabilizer matrix of the original stabilizer code. The additional freedom in the procedure also opens up new ways to construct new codes from old, and we present several ways to utilize this for the search of codes with good or even optimal parameters. In particular, we use the construction to obtain codes whose parameters exceed the best previously known. Lastly, we generalize the proof of the Griesmer bound from the classical setting to stabilizer codes since the proof relies heavily on the puncturing technique.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted version for IEEE Journal on Selected Areas in Information Theory</p></details> |

These trustless architectures, characterized by their decentralized nature and elimination of third-party intermediaries, have garnered substantial institutional attention. Consequently, the escalating security challenges confronting DApp demand rigorous scholarly investigation. This study initiates with a systematic analysis of behavioral patterns derived from empirical DApp datasets, establishing foundational insights for subsequent methodological developments. The principal security vulnerabilities in Ethereum-based smart contracts developed via Solidity are then critically examined. Specifically, reentrancy vulnerability attacks are addressed by formally representing contract logic using highly expressive code fragments. This enables precise source code-level detection via bidirectional long short-term memory networks with attention mechanisms (BLSTM-ATT). Regarding privacy preservation challenges, contemporary solutions are evaluated through dual analytical lenses: identity privacy preservation and transaction anonymity enhancement, while proposing future research trajectories in cryptographic obfuscation techniques.</p></details> |  |
| **[Local Grammar-Based Coding Revisited](http://arxiv.org/abs/2209.13636v3)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the setting of minimal local grammar-based coding, the input string is represented as a grammar with the minimal output length defined via simple symbol-by-symbol encoding. This paper discusses four contributions to this field. First, we invoke a simple harmonic bound on ranked probabilities, which reminds Zipf's law and simplifies universality proofs for minimal local grammar-based codes. Second, we refine known bounds on the vocabulary size, showing its partial power-law equivalence with mutual information and redundancy. These bounds are relevant for linking Zipf's law with the neural scaling law for large language models. Third, we develop a framework for universal codes with fixed infinite vocabularies, recasting universal coding as matching ranked patterns that are independent of empirical data. Finally, we analyze grammar-based codes with finite vocabularies being empirical rank lists, proving that that such codes are also universal. These results extend foundations of universal grammar-based coding and reaffirm previously stated connections to power laws for human language and language models.</p></details> | 41 pages, no figures |
| **[DALC: Distributed Arithmetic Coding Aided by Linear Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11784v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed Arithmetic Coding (DAC) has emerged as a feasible solution to the Slepian-Wolf problem, particularly in scenarios with non-stationary sources and for data sequences with lengths ranging from small to medium. Due to the inherent decoding ambiguity in DAC, the number of candidate paths grows exponentially with the increase in source length. To select the correct decoding path from the set of candidates, DAC decoders utilize the Maximum A Posteriori (MAP) metric to rank the decoding sequences, outputting the path with the highest MAP metric as the decoding result of the decoder. However, this method may still inadvertently output incorrect paths that have a MAP metric higher than the correct decoding path, despite not being the correct decoding path. To address the issue, we propose Distributed Arithmetic Coding Aided by Linear Codes (DALC), which employs linear codes to constrain the decoding process, thereby eliminating some incorrect paths and preserving the correct one. During the encoding phase, DALC generates the parity bits of the linear code for encoding the source data. In the decoding phase, each path in the set of candidate paths is verified in descending order according to the MAP metric until a path that meets the verification criteria is encountered, which is then outputted as the decoding result. DALC enhances the decoding performance of DAC by excluding candidate paths that do not meet the constraints imposed by linear codes. Our experimental results demonstrate that DALC reduces the Bit Error Rate(BER), with especially improvements in skewed source data scenarios.</p></details> | 7 pages, 7 figures |

In this paper we focus on codes that allow for multi-erasure pattern decoding with low computational effort. Different optimality requirements, measured by the code's rate, minimum distance, locality, availability as well as field size, influence each other and can not all be maximized at the same time. We focus on the notion of easy repair, more specifically on the construction of codes that can repair correctable erasure patterns with minimal computational effort. In particular, we introduce the easy repair property and then present codes of different rates that possess this property. The presented codes are all in some way related to simplex codes and comprise block codes as well as unit-memory convolutional codes. We also formulate conditions under which the easy repairs can be performed in parallel, thus improving access speed of the distributed storage system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Proof Generation for Rust Code via Self-Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15756v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring correctness is crucial for code generation. Formal verification offers a definitive assurance of correctness, but demands substantial human effort in proof construction and hence raises a pressing need for automation. The primary obstacle lies in the severe lack of data-there is much fewer proofs than code snippets for Large Language Models (LLMs) to train upon. In this paper, we introduce SAFE, a framework that overcomes the lack of human-written proofs to enable automated proof generation of Rust code. SAFE establishes a self-evolving cycle where data synthesis and fine-tuning collaborate to enhance the model capability, leveraging the definitive power of a symbolic verifier in telling correct proofs from incorrect ones. SAFE also re-purposes the large number of synthesized incorrect proofs to train the self-debugging capability of the fine-tuned models, empowering them to fix incorrect proofs based on the verifier's feedback. SAFE demonstrates superior efficiency and precision compared to GPT-4o. Through tens of thousands of synthesized proofs and the self-debugging mechanism, we improve the capability of open-source models, initially unacquainted with formal verification, to automatically write proofs for Rust code. This advancement leads to a significant improvement in performance, achieving a 52.52% accuracy rate in a benchmark crafted by human experts, a significant leap over GPT-4o's performance of 14.39%.</p></details> |  |

A range of methods, from simple template-based summaries to complex machine learning techniques -- and more recently, large language models -- have been employed to generate these summaries. Summarising software design patterns is important because it helps developers quickly understand and reuse complex design concepts, thereby improving software maintainability and development efficiency. However, the generation of summaries for software design patterns has not yet been explored. Our approach utilises code features and JavaParser to parse the code and create a JSON representation. Using an NLG library on this JSON representation, we convert it into natural language text that acts as a summary of the code, capturing the contextual information of the design pattern. Our empirical results indicate that the summaries generated by our approach capture the context in which patterns are applied in the codebase. Statistical evaluations demonstrate that our summaries closely align with human-written summaries, as evident from high values in the ROUGE-L, BLEU-4, NIST, and FrugalScore metrics. A follow-up survey further shows that DPS summaries were rated as capturing context better than human-generated summaries.</p></details> | <details><summary>26 pa...</summary><p>26 pages, 2 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[New Constructions of Binary Cyclic Codes with Both Relatively Large Minimum Distance and Dual Distance](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11010v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary cyclic codes are worth studying due to their applications and theoretical importance. It is an important problem to construct an infinite family of cyclic codes with large minimum distance $d$ and dual distance $d^{\perp}$. In recent years, much research has been devoted to improving the lower bound on $d$, some of which have exceeded the square-root bound. The constructions presented recently seem to indicate that when the minimum distance increases, the minimum distance of its dual code decreases. In this paper, we focus on the new constructions of binary cyclic codes with length $n=2^m-1$, dimension near $n/2$, and both relatively large minimum distance and dual distance. For $m$ is even, we construct a family of binary cyclic codes with parameters $[2^m-1,2^{m-1}\pm1,d]$, where $d\ge 2^{m/2}-1$ and $d^\perp\ge2^{m/2}$. Both the minimum distance and the dual distance are significantly better than the previous results. When $m$ is the product of two distinct primes, we construct some cyclic codes with dimensions $k=(n+1)/2$ and $d>\frac{n}{\log_2n},$ where the lower bound on the minimum distance is much larger than the square-root bound. For $m$ is odd, we present two families of binary $[2^m-1,2^{m-1},d]$ cyclic codes with $d\ge2^{(m+1)/2}-1$, $d^\perp\ge2^{(m+1)/2}$ and $d\ge2^{(m+3)/2}-15$, $d^\perp\ge2^{(m-1)/2}$ respectively, which leads that $d\cdot d^\perp$ can reach $2n$ asymptotically. To the best of our knowledge, except for the punctured binary Reed-Muller codes, there is no other construction of binary cyclic codes that reaches this bound.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Code LLM Training with Programmer Attention](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.14936v2)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Human attention provides valuable yet underexploited signals for code LLM training, offering a perspective beyond purely machine-driven attention. Despite the complexity and cost of collecting eye-tracking data, there has also been limited progress in systematically using these signals for code LLM training. To address both issues, we propose a cohesive pipeline spanning augmentation and reward-based fine-tuning. Specifically, we introduce (1) an eye-tracking path augmentation method to expand programmer attention datasets, (2) a pattern abstraction step that refines raw fixations into learnable attention motifs, and (3) a reward-guided strategy for integrating these insights directly into a CodeT5 supervised fine-tuning process. Our experiments yield +7.16 in CodeBLEU on the CodeXGlue benchmark for code summarization, underscoring how uniting human and machine attention can boost code intelligence. We hope this work encourages broader exploration of human-centric methods in next-generation AI4SE.</p></details> |  |
| **[Uplink Assisted Joint Channel Estimation and CSI Feedback: An Approach Based on Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10836v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In frequency division duplex (FDD) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems, the acquisition of downlink channel state information (CSI) is essential for maximizing spatial resource utilization and improving system spectral efficiency. The separate design of modules in AI-based CSI feedback architectures under traditional modular communication frameworks, including channel estimation (CE), CSI compression and feedback, leads to sub-optimal performance. In this paper, we propose an uplink assisted joint CE and and CSI feedback approach via deep learning for downlink CSI acquisition, which mitigates performance degradation caused by distribution bias across separately trained modules in traditional modular communication frameworks. The proposed network adopts a deep joint source-channel coding (DJSCC) architecture to mitigate the cliff effect encountered in the conventional separate source-channel coding. Furthermore, we exploit the uplink CSI as auxiliary information to enhance CSI reconstruction accuracy by leveraging the partial reciprocity between the uplink and downlink channels in FDD systems, without introducing additional overhead. The effectiveness of uplink CSI as assisted information and the necessity of an end-toend multi-module joint training architecture is validated through comprehensive ablation and scalability experiments.</p></details> |  |

Conventional NLP models misclassify or ignore code-mixed text, when mix with low resource languages such as Sinhala-English and fail to capture domain-specific knowledge. This study introduces a hybrid NLP method to improve keyword extraction, content filtering, and aspect-based classification of banking content. Keyword extraction in English is performed with a hybrid approach comprising a fine-tuned SpaCy NER model, FinBERT-based KeyBERT embeddings, YAKE, and EmbedRank, which results in a combined accuracy of 91.2%. Code-mixed and Sinhala keywords are extracted using a fine-tuned XLM-RoBERTa model integrated with a domain-specific Sinhala financial vocabulary, and it results in an accuracy of 87.4%. To ensure data quality, irrelevant comment filtering was performed using several models, with the BERT-base-uncased model achieving 85.2% for English and XLM-RoBERTa 88.1% for Sinhala, which was better than GPT-4o, SVM, and keyword-based filtering. Aspect classification followed the same pattern, with the BERT-base-uncased model achieving 87.4% for English and XLM-RoBERTa 85.9% for Sinhala, both exceeding GPT-4 and keyword-based approaches. These findings confirm that fine-tuned transformer models outperform traditional methods in multilingual financial text analysis. The present framework offers an accurate and scalable solution for brand reputation monitoring in code-mixed and low-resource banking environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 Pag...</summary><p>6 Pages, 2 figures, 7 Tables</p></details> |

Prior work addressing this challenge has mostly focused on the surface code and lattice surgery schemes. In this work, we broaden the scope by considering lattice surgery compilation for topological codes beyond the surface code. We begin by defining a code substrate - a blueprint for implementing topological codes and lattice surgery. We then abstract from the microscopic details and rephrase the compilation task as a mapping and routing problem on a macroscopic routing graph, potentially subject to substrate-specific constraints. We explore specific substrates and codes, including the color code and the folded surface code, providing detailed microscopic constructions. For the color code, we present numerical simulations analyzing how design choices at the microscopic and macroscopic levels affect the depth of compiled logical $\mathrm{CNOT}+\mathrm{T}$ circuits.

Bar graphs, tables, and AST visuals clarify results. This offers a scalable AI-driven path to cleaner codebases, which is crucial for software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unique Decoding of Reed-Solomon and Related Codes for Semi-Adversarial Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10399v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For over a quarter century, the Guruswami-Sudan algorithm has served as the state-of-the-art for list-decoding Reed-Solomon (RS) codes up to the Johnson bound against adversarial errors. However, some recent structural results on the combinatorial list decoding of randomly punctured Reed-Solomon codes suggest that Johnson bound can likely be broken for some subclasses of RS codes. Motivated by these results, we seek to make traction on understanding adversarial decoding by considering a new model: semi-adversarial errors. This error model bridges between fully random errors and fully adversarial errors by allowing some symbols of a message to be corrupted by an adversary while others are replaced with uniformly random symbols. As our main quest, we seek to understand optimal efficient unique decoding algorithms in the semi-adversarial model. In particular, we revisit some classical results on decoding interleaved Reed-Solomon codes (aka subfield evaluation RS codes) in the random error model by Bleichenbacher-Kiayias-Yung (BKY) and work to improve and extend their analysis. First, we give an improved implementation and analysis of the BKY algorithm for interleaved Reed-Solomon codes in the semi-adversarial model. In particular, our algorithm runs in near-linear time, and for most mixtures of random and adversarial errors, our analysis matches the information-theoretic optimum. Moreover, inspired by the BKY algorithm, we use a novel interpolation to extend our approach to the settings of folded Reed-Solomon codes, resulting in fast algorithms for unique decoding against semi-adversarial errors. A particular advantage of our near-linear time algorithm over state-of-the-art decoding algorithms for adversarial errors is that its running time depends only on a polynomial function of the folding parameter rather than on an exponential function.</p></details> | 45 pages |

Manual rewriting, guided by synthesis feedback, can yield high-quality results but is time-consuming and error-prone. Most existing compiler-based approaches have difficulty handling complex design constraints. Large Language Model (LLM)-based methods have emerged as a promising alternative to address these challenges. However, LLM-based approaches often face difficulties in ensuring alignment between the generated code and the provided prompts. This paper presents SymRTLO, a novel neuron-symbolic RTL optimization framework that seamlessly integrates LLM-based code rewriting with symbolic reasoning techniques. Our method incorporates a retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) system of optimization rules and Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)-based templates, enabling LLM-based rewriting that maintains syntactic correctness while minimizing undesired circuit behaviors. A symbolic module is proposed for analyzing and optimizing finite state machine (FSM) logic, allowing fine-grained state merging and partial specification handling beyond the scope of pattern-based compilers. Furthermore, a fast verification pipeline, combining formal equivalence checks with test-driven validation, further reduces the complexity of verification. Experiments on the RTL-Rewriter benchmark with Synopsys Design Compiler and Yosys show that SymRTLO improves power, performance, and area (PPA) by up to 43.9%, 62.5%, and 51.1%, respectively, compared to the state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables.

| **[The Code Barrier: What LLMs Actually Understand?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10557v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding code represents a core ability needed for automating software development tasks. While foundation models like LLMs show impressive results across many software engineering challenges, the extent of their true semantic understanding beyond simple token recognition remains unclear. This research uses code obfuscation as a structured testing framework to evaluate LLMs' semantic understanding capabilities. We methodically apply controlled obfuscation changes to source code and measure comprehension through two complementary tasks: generating accurate descriptions of obfuscated code and performing deobfuscation, a skill with important implications for reverse engineering applications. Our testing approach includes 13 cutting-edge models, covering both code-specialized (e.g., StarCoder2) and general-purpose (e.g., GPT-4o) architectures, evaluated on a benchmark created from CodeNet and consisting of filtered 250 Java programming problems and their solutions. Findings show a statistically significant performance decline as obfuscation complexity increases, with unexpected resilience shown by general-purpose models compared to their code-focused counterparts. While some models successfully identify obfuscation techniques, their ability to reconstruct the underlying program logic remains constrained, suggesting limitations in their semantic representation mechanisms. This research introduces a new evaluation approach for assessing code comprehension in language models and establishes empirical baselines for advancing research in security-critical code analysis applications such as reverse engineering and adversarial code analysis.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Semantic-based Optimization Approach for Repairing LLMs: Case Study on Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.12899v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language Models (LMs) are widely used in software engineering for code generation, but they may produce code with errors. Rather than repairing the generated code, an alternative way is to address the underlying failures of models. LM repair offers a lightweight solution to this challenge: it requires minimal data, reduces computational costs, and reduces the side effects. Unlike retraining, LM repair focuses on applying tailored updates to targeted neurons, making it ideal for scenarios with limited resources, high-performance demands, or strict safety requirements. In this paper, we propose \ul{S}emantic \ul{T}argeting for \ul{A}nalytical \ul{R}epair (\textsc{STAR}), a pioneering and novel semantic-based optimization approach for repairing LLMs. \textsc{STAR} realizes main operations in LM repair methods in an optimization process, including locating ``buggy neurons'', solving ``neuron patches'', and patching ``buggy neurons''. Correspondingly, it computes the deltas of weight matrix as the prior information to guide optimization; and attributes the targeted layers and neurons leveraging statistical insights. The neuron patches are computed with a solid semantic-based analytical formula, which directly bridges the changes to logits with the deltas of neurons, by steering latent representations. Compared to the prior work of LM repair (\textsc{MINT}) and optimization methods (\textsc{SGD}), \textsc{STAR} integrates their strengths while mitigating their limitations. \textsc{STAR} supports solving multiple failures together, significantly improving the usefulness. Evaluated on three code generation tasks using popular code LMs, \textsc{STAR} demonstrates superior effectiveness. Additionally, \textsc{STAR} exhibits better efficiency. In terms of side effects, namely the balance between generalization and specificity, \textsc{STAR} outperforms prior work by a significant margin.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figure, 6 tables, under peer-review</p></details> |
| **[CleanVul: Automatic Function-Level Vulnerability Detection in Code Commits Using LLM Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.17274v5)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate identification of software vulnerabilities is crucial for system integrity. Vulnerability datasets, often derived from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) or directly from GitHub, are essential for training machine learning models to detect these security flaws. However, these datasets frequently suffer from significant noise, typically 40% to 75%, due primarily to the automatic and indiscriminate labeling of all changes in vulnerability-fixing commits (VFCs) as vulnerability-related. This misclassification occurs because not all changes in a commit aimed at fixing vulnerabilities pertain to security threats; many are routine updates like bug fixes or test improvements. This paper introduces the first methodology that uses the Large Language Model (LLM) with a heuristic enhancement to automatically identify vulnerability-fixing changes from VFCs, achieving an F1-score of 0.82. VulSifter was applied to a large-scale study, where we conducted a crawl of 127,063 repositories on GitHub, resulting in the acquisition of 5,352,105 commits. VulSifter involves utilizing an LLM to comprehend code semantics and contextual information, while applying heuristics to filter out unrelated changes. We then developed CleanVul, a high-quality dataset comprising 8,203 functions using our LLM heuristic enhancement approach, demonstrating Correctness (90.6%) comparable to established datasets such as SVEN and PrimeVul. To evaluate the CleanVul dataset, we conducted experiments focusing on fine-tuning various LLMs on CleanVul and other high-quality datasets. Evaluation results reveal that LLMs fine-tuned on CleanVul not only exhibit enhanced accuracy but also superior generalization capabilities compared to those trained on uncleaned datasets. Specifically, models trained on CleanVul and tested on PrimeVul achieve accuracy higher than those trained and tested exclusively on PrimeVul.</p></details> |  |

Using proprietary intellectual property (IP) for FT presents a serious risk, as FT data can be leaked through LLM inference. This leads to a critical dilemma for design houses: seeking to build externally accessible LLMs offering competitive Verilog coding, how can they leverage in-house IP to enhance FT utility while ensuring IP protection? For the first time in the literature, we study this dilemma. Using LLaMA 3.1-8B, we conduct in-house FT on a baseline Verilog dataset (RTLCoder) supplemented with our own in-house IP, which is validated through multiple tape-outs. To rigorously assess IP leakage, we quantify structural similarity (AST/Dolos) and functional equivalence (Synopsys Formality) between generated codes and our in-house IP. We show that our IP can indeed be leaked, confirming the threat. As defense, we evaluate logic locking of Verilog codes (ASSURE). This offers some level of protection, yet reduces the IP's utility for FT and degrades the LLM's performance. Our study shows the need for novel strategies that are both effective and minimally disruptive to FT, an essential effort for enabling design houses to fully utilize their proprietary IP toward LLM-driven Verilog coding.</p></details> |  |

The first strategy employs direct diagonalization, while the second is based on an iterative solver. The BSE matrix is constructed with the Yambo code, and the two strategies are implemented by interfacing Yambo with the ScaLAPACK and ELPA libraries for direct diagonalization, and with the SLEPc library for the iterative approach. We consider both the hermitian (Tamm-Dancoff approximation) and pseudo-hermitian forms, addressing dense matrices of three different sizes. A description of the implementation is also provided, with details for the pseudo-hermitian case. Timing and memory utilization are analyzed on both CPU and GPU clusters. The CPU simulations are performed on a local cluster in Rome, while the GPU simulations are performed on the Leonardo HPC cluster of CINECA. Our results demonstrate that it is now feasible to handle dense BSE matrices of the order 10$^5$.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Euro-Par 2025 conference</p></details> |
| **[Code size constraints in b-symbol read channels: A bound analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10088v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In classical coding theory, error-correcting codes are designed to protect against errors occurring at individual symbol positions in a codeword. However, in practical storage and communication systems, errors often affect multiple adjacent symbols rather than single symbols independently. To address this, symbol-pair read channels were introduced \cite{Yuval2011}, and later generalized to $b$-symbol read channels \cite{yaakobi2016} to better model such error patterns. $b$-Symbol read channels generalize symbol-pair read channels to account for clustered errors in modern storage and communication systems. By developing bounds and efficient codes, researchers improve data reliability in applications such as storage devices, wireless networks, and DNA-based storage. Given integers $q$, $n$, $d$, and $b \geq 2$, let $A_b(n,d,q)$ denote the largest possible code size for which there exists a $q$-ary code of length $n$ with minimum $b$-symbol distance at least $d$. In \cite{chen2022}, various upper and lower bounds on $A_b(n,d,q)$ are given for $b=2$. In this paper, we generalize some of these bounds to the $b$-symbol read channels for $b>2$ and present several new bounds on $A_b(n,d,q)$. In particular, we establish the linear programming bound, a recurrence relation on $A_b(n,d,q)$, the Johnson bound (even), the restricted Johnson bound, the Gilbert-Varshamov-type bound, and the Elias bound for the metric of symbols $b$, $b\geq 2$. Furthermore, we provide examples demonstrating that the Gilbert-Varshamov bound we establish offers a stronger lower bound than the one presented in \cite{Song2018}. Additionally, we introduce an alternative approach to deriving the Sphere-packing and Plotkin bounds.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Vulnerabilities to Remediation: A Systematic Literature Review of LLMs in Code Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.15004v3)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for automating various programming tasks, including security-related ones, such as detecting and fixing vulnerabilities. Despite their promising capabilities, when required to produce or modify pre-existing code, LLMs could introduce vulnerabilities unbeknown to the programmer. When analyzing code, they could miss clear vulnerabilities or signal nonexistent ones. In this Systematic Literature Review (SLR), we aim to investigate both the security benefits and potential drawbacks of using LLMs for a variety of code-related tasks. In particular, first we focus on the types of vulnerabilities that could be introduced by LLMs, when used for producing code. Second, we analyze the capabilities of LLMs to detect and fix vulnerabilities, in any given code, and how the prompting strategy of choice impacts their performance in these two tasks. Last, we provide an in-depth analysis on how data poisoning attacks on LLMs can impact performance in the aforementioned tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[VeriContaminated: Assessing LLM-Driven Verilog Coding for Data Contamination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.13572v2)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have revolutionized code generation, achieving exceptional results on various established benchmarking frameworks. However, concerns about data contamination - where benchmark data inadvertently leaks into pre-training or fine-tuning datasets - raise questions about the validity of these evaluations. While this issue is known, limiting the industrial adoption of LLM-driven software engineering, hardware coding has received little to no attention regarding these risks. For the first time, we analyze state-of-the-art (SOTA) evaluation frameworks for Verilog code generation (VerilogEval and RTLLM), using established methods for contamination detection (CCD and Min-K% Prob). We cover SOTA commercial and open-source LLMs (CodeGen2.5, Minitron 4b, Mistral 7b, phi-4 mini, LLaMA-{1,2,3.1}, GPT-{2,3.5,4o}, Deepseek-Coder, and CodeQwen 1.5), in baseline and fine-tuned models (RTLCoder and Verigen). Our study confirms that data contamination is a critical concern. We explore mitigations and the resulting trade-offs for code quality vs fairness (i.e., reducing contamination toward unbiased benchmarking).</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeRAG: Supportive Code Retrieval on Bigraph for Real-World Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10046v1)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown promising performance in automated code generation, especially excelling in simple tasks such as generating standalone codes. Different from simple tasks, real-world code generation usually depends on specific programming environment (e.g., code repositories). It contains complex dependencies and domain knowledge, which is needed for LLMs when generating target code snippets. In this paper, we propose CodeRAG, a retrieval-augmented code generation (RAG) framework to comprehensively retrieve supportive codes for real-world code generation. Beginning with the requirement, CodeRAG first constructs a requirement graph for the current repository, and retrieves sub- and similar- requirement nodes of the target requirement on the graph. Meanwhile, it models the repository into a DS-code graph. CodeRAG then maps these relevant requirement nodes into their corresponding code nodes, and treats these code nodes as archors for LLM reasoning on DS-code graph. Finally, CodeRAG introduces a code-oriented agentic reasoning process, seamlessly allowing LLMs to reason and comprehensively retrieve for supportive codes which LLMs' need for generating correct programs. Experiments show that CodeRAG achieves significant improvements (i.e., increasing 40.90 and 37.79 Pass@1 on GPT-4o and Gemini-Pro on DevEval) compared to no RAG scenarios. Further tests on reasoning LLMs (i.e., QwQ-32B) confirm CodeRAG's adaptability and efficacy across various types of LLMs. In addition, CodeRAG outperforms commercial programming products such as Copilit and Cursor. We further investigate the performance of our framework on different dependency types, and observe that CodeRAG is superior in generating examples where target codes invoke predefined cross-file code snippets. These results demonstrate CodeRAG's potential in solving real-world repo-level coding challenges.</p></details> |  |
| **[ClassEval-T: Evaluating Large Language Models in Class-Level Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.06145v4)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have dramatically advanced the performance of automated code translation, making their computational accuracy score reach up to over 80% on many previous benchmarks. However, most code samples in these benchmarks are short, standalone, statement/method-level, and algorithmic, which is not aligned with practical coding tasks. Therefore, it is still unknown the actual capability of LLMs in translating code samples written for daily development. To achieve this, we construct a class-level code translation benchmark, ClassEval-T, and make the first attempt to extensively assess recent LLMs' performance on class-level code translation. ClassEval-T is extended from ClassEval, a well-known class-level Python code generation benchmark consisting of multiple practical coding topics, such as database operation and game design, and diverse contextual dependencies (e.g., fields, methods, and libraries). It cost us 360 person-hours to accomplish the manual migration to Java and C++ with complete code samples and associated test suites. Subsequently, we design three translation strategies (i.e., holistic, min-dependency, and standalone) for class-level code translations and evaluate eight recent LLMs of commercial, general, and code kinds in diverse families and sizes on ClassEval-T. Experimental results demonstrate a remarkable performance drop compared with the most widely studied method-level code translation benchmark, and obvious discrepancies among LLMs appear, showing the effectiveness of ClassEval-T in measuring recent LLMs. Afterwards, we further discuss the usage scenarios for diverse translation strategies and LLMs' ability to dependency awareness when translating class samples. Finally, 1,243 failure cases made by the best-performing LLM under test are analyzed and categorized in this paper for practical guidance and future enlightenment.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, focusing on a common synthesis machine, which generates multiple DNA strands in parallel following a fixed supersequence,we propose constrained codes with polynomial-time encoding and decoding algorithms. Compared to the existing works, our codes simultaneously satisfy both l-runlength limited and {\epsilon}-balanced constraints. By enumerating all valid sequences, our codes achieve the maximum rate, matching the capacity. Additionally, we design constrained error-correcting codes capable of correcting one insertion or deletion in the obtained DNA sequence while still adhering to the constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Explicit Folded Reed-Solomon and Multiplicity Codes Achieve Relaxed Generalized Singleton Bounds](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.15925v3)** | 2025-04-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we prove that explicit FRS codes and multiplicity codes achieve relaxed generalized Singleton bounds for list size $L\ge1.$ Specifically, we show the following: (1) FRS code of length $n$ and rate $R$ over the alphabet $\mathbb{F}_q^s$ with distinct evaluation points is $\left(\frac{L}{L+1}\left(1-\frac{sR}{s-L+1}\right),L\right)$ list-decodable (LD) for list size $L\in[s]$. (2) Multiplicity code of length $n$ and rate $R$ over the alphabet $\mathbb{F}_p^s$ with distinct evaluation points is $\left(\frac{L}{L+1}\left(1-\frac{sR}{s-L+1}\right),L\right)$ LD for list size $L\in[s]$. Choosing $s=\Theta(1/\epsilon^2)$ and $L=O(1/\epsilon)$, our results imply that both FRS codes and multiplicity codes achieve LD capacity $1-R-\epsilon$ with optimal list size $O(1/\epsilon)$. This exponentially improves the previous state of the art $(1/\epsilon)^{O(1/\epsilon)}$ established by Kopparty et. al. (FOCS 2018) and Tamo (IEEE TIT, 2024). In particular, our results on FRS codes fully resolve a open problem proposed by Guruswami and Rudra (STOC 2006). Furthermore, our results imply the first explicit constructions of $(1-R-\epsilon,O(1/\epsilon))$ LD codes of rate $R$ with poly-sized alphabets. Our method can also be extended to analyze the list-recoverability (LR) of FRS codes. We provide a tighter radius upper bound that FRS codes cannot be $(\frac{L+1-\ell}{L+1}(1-\frac{mR}{m-1})+o(1),\ell, L)$ LR where $m=\lceil\log_{\ell}{(L+1)}\rceil$. We conjecture this bound is almost tight when $L+1=\ell^a$ for any $a\in\mathbb{N}^{\ge 2}$. To give some evidences, we show FRS codes are $\left(\frac{1}{2}-\frac{sR}{s-2},2,3\right)$ LR, which proves the tightness in the smallest non-trivial case. Our bound refutes the possibility that FRS codes could achieve LR capacity $(1-R-\epsilon, \ell, O(\frac{\ell}{\epsilon}))$. This implies an intrinsic separation between LD and LR of FRS codes.</p></details> | STOC 2025 |

Large language models (LLMs) although have brought impressive improvement to source code tasks, do not directly generalize to assembly code due to the unique challenges of assembly: (1) the low information density of assembly and (2) the diverse optimizations in assembly code. To overcome these challenges, this work proposes a hierarchical attention mechanism that builds attention summaries to capture the semantics more effectively and designs contrastive learning objectives to train LLMs to learn assembly optimization. Equipped with these techniques, this work develops Nova, a generative LLM for assembly code. Nova outperforms existing techniques on binary code decompilation by up to 14.84 -- 21.58% (absolute percentage point improvement) higher Pass@1 and Pass@10, and outperforms the latest binary code similarity detection techniques by up to 6.17% Recall@1, showing promising abilities on both assembly generation and understanding tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Migrating Code At Scale With LLMs At Google](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09691v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Developers often evolve an existing software system by making internal changes, called migration. Moving to a new framework, changing implementation to improve efficiency, and upgrading a dependency to its latest version are examples of migrations. Migration is a common and typically continuous maintenance task undertaken either manually or through tooling. Certain migrations are labor intensive and costly, developers do not find the required work rewarding, and they may take years to complete. Hence, automation is preferred for such migrations. In this paper, we discuss a large-scale, costly and traditionally manual migration project at Google, propose a novel automated algorithm that uses change location discovery and a Large Language Model (LLM) to aid developers conduct the migration, report the results of a large case study, and discuss lessons learned. Our case study on 39 distinct migrations undertaken by three developers over twelve months shows that a total of 595 code changes with 93,574 edits have been submitted, where 74.45% of the code changes and 69.46% of the edits were generated by the LLM. The developers reported high satisfaction with the automated tooling, and estimated a 50% reduction on the total time spent on the migration compared to earlier manual migrations. Our results suggest that our automated, LLM-assisted workflow can serve as a model for similar initiatives.</p></details> |  |

In code generation, even minor errors can easily break the entire solution. Leveraging multiple sampled solutions can significantly improve the overall output quality. One effective way to enhance code generation is by pairing a code generation model with a reranker model, which selects the best solution from the generated samples. We propose a novel iterative self-training approach for self-training reranker models using Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), aimed at improving both reranking accuracy and the overall code generation process. Unlike traditional PPO approaches, where the focus is on optimizing a generative model with a reward model, our approach emphasizes the development of a robust reward/reranking model. This model improves the quality of generated code through reranking and addresses problems and errors that the reward model might overlook during PPO alignment with the reranker. Our method iteratively refines the training dataset by re-evaluating outputs, identifying high-scoring negative examples, and incorporating them into the training loop, that boosting model performance. Our evaluation on the MultiPL-E dataset demonstrates that our 13.4B parameter model outperforms a 33B model in code generation quality while being three times faster. Moreover, it achieves performance comparable to GPT-4 and surpasses it in one programming language.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published at ECIR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Bounds and Optimal Constructions of Generalized Merge-Convertible Codes for Code Conversion into LRCs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09580v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Error-correcting codes are essential for ensuring fault tolerance in modern distributed data storage systems. However, in practice, factors such as the failure rates of storage devices can vary significantly over time, resulting in changes to the optimal code parameters. To reduce storage costs while maintaining efficiency, Maturana and Rashmi introduced a theoretical framework known as code conversion, which enables dynamic adjustment of code parameters according to device performance. In this paper, we focus exclusively on the bounds and constructions of generalized merge-convertible codes. First, we establish a new lower bound on the access cost when the final code is an $(r,\delta)$-LRC. This bound unifies and generalizes all previously known bounds for merge conversion where the initial and final codes are either an LRC or an MDS code. We then construct a family of access-optimal MDS convertible codes by leveraging subgroups of the automorphism group of a rational function field. It is worth noting that our construction is also per-symbol read access-optimal. Next, we further extend our MDS-based construction to design access-optimal convertible codes for the conversion between $(r,\delta)$-LRCs. Finally, using the parity-check matrix approach, we present a construction of access-optimal convertible codes that enable merge conversion from MDS codes to an $(r,\delta)$-LRC. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first explicit optimal construction of code conversion between MDS codes and LRCs. All of our constructions are over finite fields whose sizes grow linearly with the code length.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Rate-Immediacy Barrier in Explicit Tree Code Constructions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09388v1)** | 2025-04-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Since the introduction of tree codes by Schulman (STOC 1993), explicit construction of such codes has remained a notorious challenge. While the construction of asymptotically-good explicit tree codes continues to be elusive, a work by Cohen, Haeupler and Schulman (STOC 2018), as well as the state-of-the-art construction by Ben Yaacov, Cohen, and Yankovitz (STOC 2022) have achieved codes with rate $\Omega(1/\log\log n)$, exponentially improving upon the original construction of Evans, Klugerman and Schulman from 1994. All of these constructions rely, at least in part, on increasingly sophisticated methods of combining (block) error-correcting codes. In this work, we identify a fundamental barrier to constructing tree codes using current techniques. We introduce a key property, which we call immediacy, that, while not required by the original definition of tree codes, is shared by all known constructions and inherently arises from recursive combinations of error-correcting codes. Our main technical contribution is the proof of a rate-immediacy tradeoff, which, in particular, implies that any tree code with constant distance and non-trivial immediacy must necessarily have vanishing rate. By applying our rate-immediacy tradeoff to existing constructions, we establish that their known rate analyses are essentially optimal. More broadly, our work highlights the need for fundamentally new ideas--beyond the recursive use of error-correcting codes--to achieve substantial progress in explicitly constructing asymptotically-good tree codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Type-Constrained Code Generation with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.09246v1)** | 2025-04-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved notable success in code generation. However, they still frequently produce uncompilable output because their next-token inference procedure does not model formal aspects of code. Although constrained decoding is a promising approach to alleviate this issue, it has only been applied to handle either domain-specific languages or syntactic language features. This leaves typing errors, which are beyond the domain of syntax and generally hard to adequately constrain. To address this challenge, we introduce a type-constrained decoding approach that leverages type systems to guide code generation. We develop novel prefix automata for this purpose and introduce a sound approach to enforce well-typedness based on type inference and a search over inhabitable types. We formalize our approach on a simply-typed language and extend it to TypeScript to demonstrate practicality. Our evaluation on HumanEval shows that our approach reduces compilation errors by more than half and increases functional correctness in code synthesis, translation, and repair tasks across LLMs of various sizes and model families, including SOTA open-weight models with more than 30B parameters.</p></details> |  |

In this article, we find generators for trace dual spaces of different families of $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. In particular, given the field extension $\mathbb{F}_q\leq \mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ with $q$ an odd prime power, we determine the trace Euclidean and trace Hermitian dual codes for the general $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear cyclic $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$-code. In addition, we also determine the trace Euclidean and trace Hermitian duals for general $\mathbb{F}_q$-linear skew cyclic $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$-codes, which are defined to be left $\mathbb{F}_q[X]$-submodules of $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[X;\sigma]/(X^n-1)$, where $\sigma$ denotes the Frobenius automorphism and $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[X;\sigma]$ the induced skew polynomial ring.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Code-Craft: Hierarchical Graph-Based Code Summarization for Enhanced Context Retrieval](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08975v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding and navigating large-scale codebases remains a significant challenge in software engineering. Existing methods often treat code as flat text or focus primarily on local structural relationships, limiting their ability to provide holistic, context-aware information retrieval. We present Hierarchical Code Graph Summarization (HCGS), a novel approach that constructs a multi-layered representation of a codebase by generating structured summaries in a bottom-up fashion from a code graph. HCGS leverages the Language Server Protocol for language-agnostic code analysis and employs a parallel level-based algorithm for efficient summary generation. Through extensive evaluation on five diverse codebases totaling 7,531 functions, HCGS demonstrates significant improvements in code retrieval accuracy, achieving up to 82 percentage relative improvement in top-1 retrieval precision for large codebases like libsignal (27.15 percentage points), and perfect Pass@3 scores for smaller repositories. The system's hierarchical approach consistently outperforms traditional code-only retrieval across all metrics, with particularly substantial gains in larger, more complex codebases where understanding function relationships is crucial.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optuna vs Code Llama: Are LLMs a New Paradigm for Hyperparameter Tuning?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06006v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Optimal hyperparameter selection is critical for maximizing neural network performance, especially as models grow in complexity. This work investigates the viability of leveraging large language models (LLMs) for hyperparameter optimization by fine-tuning a parameter-efficient version of Code Llama using LoRA. The adapted LLM is capable of generating accurate and efficient hyperparameter recommendations tailored to diverse neural network architectures. Unlike traditional approaches such as Optuna, which rely on computationally intensive trial-and-error procedures, our method achieves competitive or superior results in terms of Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) while significantly reducing computational overhead. Our findings demonstrate that LLM-based optimization not only matches the performance of state-of-the-art techniques like Tree-structured Parzen Estimators (TPE) but also substantially accelerates the tuning process. This positions LLMs as a promising alternative for rapid experimentation, particularly in resource-constrained environments such as edge devices and mobile platforms, where computational efficiency is essential. In addition to improved efficiency, the method offers time savings and consistent performance across various tasks, highlighting its robustness and generalizability. All generated hyperparameters are included in the LEMUR Neural Network (NN) Dataset, which is publicly available and serves as an open-source benchmark for hyperparameter optimization research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robo-Instruct: Simulator-Augmented Instruction Alignment For Finetuning Code LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.20179v3)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code LLMs have shown promising results with converting tasks in natural language to programs that can be executed by service robots. We are interested in finetuning small, specialized LLMs for this purpose, but collecting datasets of task-program pairs specific to each robot is time-consuming and expensive. While approaches such as SELF-INSTRUCT and EVOL-INSTRUCT are capable of generating novel tasks given a few examples, they are unable to provide the corresponding programs that correctly abide by physical-world and robot-constraints using the provided programming interface. Using a simulator is a natural potential solution to checking for such constraints, but building simulation environments that can handle arbitrary tasks and their necessary objects and locations, is challenging. To address these challenges, we introduce ROBO-INSTRUCT, which synthesizes task-specific simulation environments on the fly during program execution, by opportunistically inferring entity properties and enforcing corresponding constraints based on how the entities are used in the task program. Additionally, ROBO-INSTRUCT integrates an LLM-aided post-processing procedure to refine instructions for better alignment with robot programs. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ROBO-INSTRUCT across multiple LLMs, showing that our fine-tuned models outperform all baseline methods and even match or surpass the performance of several larger and proprietary models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards an Understanding of Context Utilization in Code Intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08734v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code intelligence is an emerging domain in software engineering, aiming to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of various code-related tasks. Recent research suggests that incorporating contextual information beyond the basic original task inputs (i.e., source code) can substantially enhance model performance. Such contextual signals may be obtained directly or indirectly from sources such as API documentation or intermediate representations like abstract syntax trees can significantly improve the effectiveness of code intelligence. Despite growing academic interest, there is a lack of systematic analysis of context in code intelligence. To address this gap, we conduct an extensive literature review of 146 relevant studies published between September 2007 and August 2024. Our investigation yields four main contributions. (1) A quantitative analysis of the research landscape, including publication trends, venues, and the explored domains; (2) A novel taxonomy of context types used in code intelligence; (3) A task-oriented analysis investigating context integration strategies across diverse code intelligence tasks; (4) A critical evaluation of evaluation methodologies for context-aware methods. Based on these findings, we identify fundamental challenges in context utilization in current code intelligence systems and propose a research roadmap that outlines key opportunities for future research.</p></details> |  |

Identifying EVM-Inequivalent Code Smells in Multi-chain Reuse Contracts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07589v2)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the development of Solidity contracts on Ethereum, more developers are reusing them on other compatible blockchains. However, developers may overlook the differences between the designs of the blockchain system, such as the Gas Mechanism and Consensus Protocol, leading to the same contracts on different blockchains not being able to achieve consistent execution as on Ethereum. This inconsistency reveals design flaws in reused contracts, exposing code smells that hinder code reusability, and we define this inconsistency as EVM-Inequivalent Code Smells. In this paper, we conducted the first empirical study to reveal the causes and characteristics of EVM-Inequivalent Code Smells. To ensure the identified smells reflect real developer concerns, we collected and analyzed 1,379 security audit reports and 326 Stack Overflow posts related to reused contracts on EVM-compatible blockchains, such as Binance Smart Chain (BSC) and Polygon. Using the open card sorting method, we defined six types of EVM-Inequivalent Code Smells. For automated detection, we developed a tool named EquivGuard. It employs static taint analysis to identify key paths from different patterns and uses symbolic execution to verify path reachability. Our analysis of 905,948 contracts across six major blockchains shows that EVM-Inequivalent Code Smells are widespread, with an average prevalence of 17.70%. While contracts with code smells do not necessarily lead to financial loss and attacks, their high prevalence and significant asset management underscore the potential threats of reusing these smelly Ethereum contracts. Thus, developers are advised to abandon Copy-and-Paste programming practices and detect EVM-Inequivalent Code Smells before reusing Ethereum contracts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ISSTA2025</p></details> |

First, we generalize previous results to multiplicity rational codes by considering modular reductions with respect to prime power moduli. Then, using hybrid analysis techniques, we extend our approach to vectors of fractions that may present bad primes. Our contributions include: a decoding algorithm for simultaneous rational number reconstruction with multiplicities, a rigorous analysis of the algorithm's failure probability that generalizes several previous results, an extension to a hybrid model handling situations where not all errors can be assumed random, and a unified approach to handle bad primes within multiplicities. The theoretical results provide a comprehensive probabilistic analysis of reconstruction failure in these more complex scenarios, advancing the state of the art in error correction for rational number codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[RTLRepoCoder: Repository-Level RTL Code Completion through the Combination of Fine-Tuning and Retrieval Augmentation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08862v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As an essential part of modern hardware design, manually writing Register Transfer Level (RTL) code such as Verilog is often labor-intensive. Following the tremendous success of large language models (LLMs), researchers have begun to explore utilizing LLMs for generating RTL code. However, current studies primarily focus on generating simple single modules, which can not meet the demands in real world. In fact, due to challenges in managing long-context RTL code and complex cross-file dependencies, existing solutions cannot handle large-scale Verilog repositories in practical hardware development. As the first endeavor to exclusively adapt LLMs for large-scale RTL development, we propose RTLRepoCoder, a groundbreaking solution that incorporates specific fine-tuning and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for repository-level Verilog code completion. Open-source Verilog repositories from the real world, along with an extended context size, are used for domain-specific fine-tuning. The optimized RAG system improves the information density of the input context by retrieving relevant code snippets. Tailored optimizations for RAG are carried out, including the embedding model, the cross-file context splitting strategy, and the chunk size. Our solution achieves state-of-the-art performance on public benchmark, significantly surpassing GPT-4 and advanced domain-specific LLMs on Edit Similarity and Exact Match rate. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our approach and offer insights for future work.</p></details> |  |

With the aid of B\.ezier extraction technique, a derived explicit stiffness matrix computation formula is applied to all B-spline IGA elements with rectangular shape under linear elasticity assumption. Using the aforementioned explicit formula, the stiffness matrix calculation and updating of IGA are significantly simplified, which leads to the current ITO code implemented only in one main function without calling subroutines, such as IGA mesh generation and Gaussian quadrature. Both two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) cases are taken into consideration, which result into iga_top120 and iga_top3D257 MATLAB codes for 2D and 3D design problems. Numerical examples validate the effectiveness of our open-source codes, with several user-defined input parameters basically identical to those used in top88 and top3D. Therefore, iga_top120 and iga_top3D257 provide an effective entry for the code transforming from FEM-based TO into ITO.</p></details> |  |

Existing code search datasets face limitations: they rely on human annotators who assess code primarily through semantic understanding rather than functional verification, leading to potential inaccuracies and scalability issues. Additionally, current evaluation metrics often overlook the multi-choice nature of code search. This paper introduces CoSQA+, pairing high-quality queries from CoSQA with multiple suitable codes. We develop an automated pipeline featuring multiple model-based candidate selections and the novel test-driven agent annotation system. Among a single Large Language Model (LLM) annotator and Python expert annotators (without test-based verification), agents leverage test-based verification and achieve the highest accuracy of 92.0%. Through extensive experiments, CoSQA+ has demonstrated superior quality over CoSQA. Models trained on CoSQA+ exhibit improved performance.

| **[A Vulnerability Code Intent Summary Dataset](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08180v1)** | 2025-04-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the era of Large Language Models (LLMs), the code summarization technique boosts a lot, along with the emergence of many new significant works. However, the potential of code summarization in the Computer Security Area still remains explored. Can we generate a code summary of a code snippet for its security intention? Thus, this work proposes an innovative large-scale multi-perspective Code Intent Summary Dataset named BADS , aiming to increase the understanding of a given code snippet and reduce the risk in the code developing process. The procedure of establishing a dataset can be divided into four steps: First, we collect samples of codes with known vulnerabilities as well as code generated by AI from multiple sources. Second, we do the data clean and format unification, then do the data combination. Third, we utilize the LLM to automatically Annotate the code snippet. Last, We do the human evaluation to double-check. The dataset contains X code examples which cover Y categories of vulnerability. Our data are from Z open-source projects and CVE entries, and compared to existing work, our dataset not only contains original code but also code function summary and security intent summary, providing context information for research in code security analysis. All information is in CSV format. The contributions of this paper are four-fold: the establishment of a high-quality, multi-perspective Code Intent Summary Dataset; an innovative method in data collection and processing; A new multi-perspective code analysis framework that promotes cross-disciplinary research in the fields of software engineering and cybersecurity; improving the practicality and scalability of the research outcomes by considering the code length limitations in real-world applications.

| **[Large Language Model for Verilog Generation with Code-Structure-Guided Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.18271v3)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have sparked significant interest in the automatic generation of Register Transfer Level (RTL) designs, particularly using Verilog. Current research on this topic primarily focuses on pre-training and instruction tuning, but the effectiveness of these methods is constrained by the limited availability of training data, as public Verilog code is far less abundant than software code. In particular, these methods struggle to effectively capture Verilog parallel code structures, which fundamentally differ from the imperative, sequential control flow typical in most software programming languages. This paper introduces VeriSeek, an LLM enhanced by reinforcement learning using a limited amount of high-quality training data to achieve high Verilog code generation performance. Our reinforcement learning approach employs code structure information as feedback signals to refine the pre-trained model, enabling it to effectively learn important patterns from Verilog code with parallel structures. Experiments show that VeriSeek outperforms state-of-the-art methods across multiple benchmarks.</p></details> |  |

Consequently, we establish a condition under which a linear code has a trivial intersection with another linear code (or its Galois dual). Furthermore, we provide a condition for reversibility and propose a generator matrix formula for the largest reversible subcode of any linear code. We then focus on the comprehensive class of multi-twisted (MT) codes, which are naturally and more effectively represented using generator polynomial matrices (GPMs). We prove that the reversed code of an MT code remains MT and derive an explicit formula for its GPM. Additionally, we examine the intersection of a pair of MT codes, possibly with different shift constants, and demonstrate that this intersection is not necessarily MT. However, when the intersection admits an MT structure, we propose the corresponding shift constants. We also establish a GPM formula for the intersection of a pair of MT codes with the same shift constants. This result enables us to derive a GPM formula for the intersection of an MT code and the Galois dual of another MT code. Finally, we examine conditions for various properties on MT codes. Perhaps most importantly, the necessary and sufficient conditions for an MT code to be Galois self-orthogonal, Galois dual-containing, Galois linear complementary dual (LCD), or reversible.</p></details> |  |

We propose an upper bound on the redundancy of these codes, based on the minimum possible length of an error-correcting code with a given number of codewords and minimum distance. Additionally, we provide a sufficient optimality condition for the function-correcting codes when $\lambda = 4$. We also demonstrate that any function can be represented as a $\rho$-locally $\lambda$-function, illustrating this with a representation of Hamming weight distribution functions. Furthermore, we present another construction of function-correcting codes for Hamming weight distribution functions.</p></details> |  |

By leveraging the strengths of both optimization techniques and machine learning, this method introduces a robust framework for solving complex optimization problems where traditional methods may fall short. The proposed approach encapsulates the constraints and objectives of a linear programming problem directly into the loss function, guiding the learning process to adhere to these constraints while optimizing the desired outcomes. This technique not only preserves the interpretability of linear programming but also benefits from the flexibility and adaptability of machine learning, making it particularly well-suited for unsupervised or semi-supervised learning scenarios.</p></details> |  |

One potential application of these models in the educational field would be to provide feedback to students in university introductory programming courses, so that a student struggling to solve a basic implementation problem could seek help from an LLM available 24/7. This article focuses on studying three aspects related to such an application. First, the performance of two well-known models, GPT-3.5T and GPT-4T, in providing feedback to students is evaluated. The empirical results showed that GPT-4T performs much better than GPT-3.5T, however, it is not yet ready for use in a real-world scenario. This is due to the possibility of generating incorrect information that potential users may not always be able to detect. Second, the article proposes a carefully designed prompt using in-context learning techniques that allows automating important parts of the evaluation process, as well as providing a lower bound for the fraction of feedbacks containing incorrect information, saving time and effort. This was possible because the resulting feedback has a programmatically analyzable structure that incorporates diagnostic information about the LLM's performance in solving the requested task. Third, the article also suggests a possible strategy for implementing a practical learning tool based on LLMs, which is rooted on the proposed prompting techniques. This strategy opens up a whole range of interesting possibilities from a pedagogical perspective.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Road to Hybrid Quantum Programs: Characterizing the Evolution from Classical to Hybrid Quantum Software](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.11450v2)** | 2025-04-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum computing exhibits the unique capability to natively and efficiently encode various natural phenomena, promising theoretical speedups of several orders of magnitude. However, not all computational tasks can be efficiently executed on quantum machines, giving rise to hybrid systems, where some portions of an application run on classical machines, while others utilize quantum resources. Efforts to identify quantum candidate code fragments that can meaningfully execute on quantum machines primarily rely on static code analysis. Yet, the state-of-the-art in static code analysis for quantum candidates remains in its infancy, with limited applicability to specific frameworks and languages, and a lack of generalizability. Existing methods often involve a trial-and-error approach, relying on the intuition and expertise of computer scientists, resulting in varying identification durations ranging from minutes to days for a single application. This paper aims to systematically formalize the process of identifying quantum candidates and their proper encoding within classical programs. Our work addresses the critical initial step in the development of automated reasoning techniques for code-to-code translation, laying the foundation for more efficient quantum software engineering. Particularly, this study investigates a sociotechnical phenomenon where the starting point is not a problem directly solvable with QC, but rather an existing classical program that addresses the problem. In doing so, it underscores the interdisciplinary nature of QC application development, necessitating collaboration between domain experts, computer scientists, and physicists to harness the potential of quantum computing effectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in the First International Workshop on Quantum Software Engineering: The Next Evolution</p></details> |

In distributed learning, manual parallelism (MP) methods demand considerable human effort and have limited flexibility. Hence, automatic parallelism (AP) methods have recently been proposed for automating the parallel strategy optimization process. Existing AP methods suffer from sub-optimal solutions because they do not jointly optimize the two categories of parallel strategies (i.e., inter-layer parallelism and intra-layer parallelism). In this paper, we propose a novel AP method called UniAP, which unifies inter- and intra-layer automatic parallelism by mixed integer quadratic programming. To the best of our knowledge, UniAP is the first parallel method that can jointly optimize the two categories of parallel strategies to find an optimal solution. Experimental results show that UniAP outperforms state-of-the-art methods by up to 3.80$\times$ in throughput and reduces strategy optimization time by up to 107$\times$ across five Transformer-based models.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 10 figures, CVPR 2025</p></details> |

An NL outline for a code function comprises multiple statements written in concise prose, which partition the code and summarize its main ideas in the style of literate programming. Crucially, we find that modern LLMs can generate accurate and high-quality NL outlines in practice. Moreover, NL outlines enable a bidirectional sync between code and NL, where a developer can change either code or NL and have the LLM automatically update the other. We discuss many use cases for NL outlines: they can accelerate understanding and navigation of code and diffs, simplify code maintenance, augment code search, steer code generation, and more. We then propose and compare multiple LLM prompting techniques for generating outlines and ask professional developers to judge outline quality. Finally, we present two case studies applying NL outlines toward code review and malware detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to FSE'25 Industry Track</p></details> |
| **[Unlocking LLM Repair Capabilities in Low-Resource Programming Languages Through Cross-Language Translation and Multi-Agent Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22512v3)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in leveraging LLMs for APR have demonstrated impressive capabilities in fixing software defects. However, current LLM-based approaches predominantly focus on mainstream programming languages like Java and Python, neglecting less prevalent but emerging languages such as Rust due to expensive training resources, limited datasets, and insufficient community support. This narrow focus creates a significant gap in repair capabilities across the programming language spectrum, where the full potential of LLMs for comprehensive multilingual program repair remains largely unexplored. To address this limitation, we introduce a novel cross-language program repair approach LANTERN that leverages LLMs' differential proficiency across languages through a multi-agent iterative repair paradigm. Our technique strategically translates defective code from languages where LLMs exhibit weaker repair capabilities to languages where they demonstrate stronger performance, without requiring additional training. A key innovation of our approach is an LLM-based decision-making system that dynamically selects optimal target languages based on bug characteristics and continuously incorporates feedback from previous repair attempts. We evaluate our method on xCodeEval, a comprehensive multilingual benchmark comprising 5,068 bugs across 11 programming languages. Results demonstrate significant enhancement in repair effectiveness, particularly for underrepresented languages, with Rust showing a 22.09% improvement in Pass@10 metrics. Our research provides the first empirical evidence that cross-language translation significantly expands the repair capabilities of LLMs and effectively bridges the performance gap between programming languages with different levels of popularity, opening new avenues for truly language-agnostic automated program repair.</p></details> |  |
| **[Is Productivity in Quantum Programming Equivalent to Expressiveness?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08876v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The expressiveness of quantum programming languages plays a crucial role in the efficient and comprehensible representation of quantum algorithms. Unlike classical programming languages, which offer mature and well-defined abstraction mechanisms, quantum languages must integrate cognitively challenging concepts such as superposition, interference and entanglement while maintaining clarity and usability. However, identifying and characterizing differences in expressiveness between quantum programming paradigms remains an open area of study. Our work investigates the landscape of expressiveness through a comparative analysis of hosted quantum programming languages such as Qiskit, Cirq, Qrisp, and quAPL, and standalone languages including Q# and Qmod. We focused on evaluating how different quantum programming languages support the implementation of core quantum algorithms -- Deutsch-Jozsa, Simon, Bernstein-Vazirani, and Grover -- using expressiveness metrics: Lines of Code (LOC), Cyclomatic Complexity (CC), and Halstead Complexity (HC) metrics as proxies for developer productivity. Our findings suggest that different quantum programming paradigms offer distinct trade-offs between expressiveness and productivity, highlighting the importance of language design in quantum software development.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |

In the first study of its kind, we analyze fixation-related potentials (FRPs) to explore the online processing of program code patterns that are ambiguous to programmers, but not the computer (so-called atoms of confusion), and their underlying neurocognitive mechanisms in an ecologically valid setting. Relative to unambiguous counterparts in program code, atoms of confusion elicit a late frontal positivity with a duration of about 400 to 700 ms after first looking at the atom of confusion. As the frontal positivity shows high resemblance with an event-related potential (ERP) component found during natural language processing that is elicited by unexpected but plausible words in sentence context, we take these data to suggest that the brain engages similar neurocognitive mechanisms in response to unexpected and informative inputs in program code and in natural language. In both domains, these inputs lead to an update of a comprehender's situation model that is essential for information extraction from a quickly unfolding input.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context Switching for Secure Multi-programming of Near-Term Quantum Computers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07048v3)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-programming quantum computers improve device utilization and throughput. However, crosstalk from concurrent two-qubit CNOT gates poses security risks, compromising the fidelity and output of co-running victim programs. We design Zero Knowledge Tampering Attacks (ZKTAs), using which attackers can exploit crosstalk without knowledge of the hardware error profile. ZKTAs can alter victim program outputs in 40% of cases on commercial systems. We identify that ZKTAs succeed because the attacker's program consistently runs with the same victim program in a fixed context. To mitigate this, we propose QONTEXTS: a context-switching technique that defends against ZKTAs by running programs across multiple contexts, each handling only a subset of trials. QONTEXTS uses multi-programming with frequent context switching while identifying a unique set of programs for each context. This helps limit only a fraction of execution to ZKTAs. We enhance QONTEXTS with attack detection capabilities that compare the distributions from different contexts against each other to identify noisy contexts executed with ZKTAs. Our evaluations on real IBMQ systems show that QONTEXTS increases program resilience by three orders of magnitude and fidelity by 1.33$\times$ on average. Moreover, QONTEXTS improves throughput by 2$\times$, advancing security in multi-programmed environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Hitchhiker's Guide to Program Analysis, Part II: Deep Thoughts by LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11711v2)** | 2025-04-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static analysis is a cornerstone for software vulnerability detection, yet it often struggles with the classic precision-scalability trade-off. In practice, such tools often produce high false positive rates, particularly in large codebases like the Linux kernel. This imprecision can arise from simplified vulnerability modeling and over-approximation of path and data constraints. While large language models (LLMs) show promise in code understanding, their naive application to program analysis yields unreliable results due to inherent reasoning limitations. We introduce BugLens, a post-refinement framework that significantly improves static analysis precision. BugLens guides an LLM to follow traditional analysis steps by assessing buggy code patterns for security impact and validating the constraints associated with static warnings. Evaluated on real-world Linux kernel bugs, BugLens raises precision from 0.10 (raw) and 0.50 (semi-automated refinement) to 0.72, substantially reducing false positives and revealing four previously unreported vulnerabilities. Our results suggest that a structured LLM-based workflow can meaningfully enhance the effectiveness of static analysis tools.</p></details> |  |

While the use of blocks prevents syntax errors, learners can still make semantic mistakes, requiring feedback and help. As teachers may be overwhelmed by help requests in a classroom, may lack programming expertise themselves, or may be unavailable in independent learning scenarios, automated hint generation is desirable. Automated program repair (APR) can provide the foundation for this, but relies on multiple assumptions: (1) APR usually targets isolated bugs, but learners may fundamentally misunderstand tasks or request help for substantially incomplete code. (2) Software tests are required to guide the search and localize broken blocks, but tests for block-based programs are different to those in past APR research: They consist of system tests, and very few of them already fully cover the code. At the same time, they have vastly longer runtimes due to animations and interactions on Scratch programs, which inhibits the applicability of search. (3) The plastic surgery hypothesis assumes the code necessary for repairs already exists in the codebase. Block-based programs tend to be small and may lack this redundancy. To study if APR of such programs is still feasible, we introduce, to the best of our knowledge, the first APR approach for Scratch based on evolutionary search. Our RePurr prototype includes novel refinements of fault localization to improve the guidance of test suites, recovers the plastic surgery hypothesis by exploiting that learning scenarios provide model and student solutions, and reduces the costs of fitness evaluations via test parallelization and acceleration. Empirical evaluation on a set of real learners' programs confirms the anticipated challenges, but also demonstrates APR can still effectively improve and fix learners' programs, enabling automated generation of hints and feedback.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Generating Pragmatic Examples to Train Neural Program Synthesizers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2311.05740v2)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Programming-by-example is the task of synthesizing a program that is consistent with a set of user-provided input-output examples. As examples are often an under-specification of one's intent, a good synthesizer must choose the intended program from the many that are consistent with the given set of examples. Prior work frames program synthesis as a cooperative game between a listener (that synthesizes programs) and a speaker (a user choosing examples), and shows that models of computational pragmatic inference are effective in choosing the user intended programs. However, these models require counterfactual reasoning over a large set of programs and examples, which is infeasible in realistic program spaces. In this paper, we propose PraX, a novel way to amortize this search with neural networks. We sample pairs of programs and examples via self-play between listener and speaker models, and use pragmatic inference to choose informative training examples from this sample. We then use the informative dataset to train models to improve the synthesizer's ability to disambiguate user-provided examples without human supervision. We validate PraX on the challenging task of synthesizing regular expressions from example strings, and find that our method (1) outperforms models trained without choosing pragmatic examples by 23% (a 51% relative increase) (2) matches the performance of supervised learning on a dataset of pragmatic examples provided by humans, despite using no human data in training.</p></details> | ICLR 2024 |

We previously introduced EdgeWise, a hybrid approach that combines declarative programming with Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) to determine optimal placements that minimise operational costs and unnecessary data transfers. The declarative stage pre-processes infrastructure constraints to improve the efficiency of the MILP solver, achieving optimal placements in terms of operational costs, with significantly reduced execution times. In this extended version, we improve the declarative stage with continuous reasoning, presenting EdgeWiseCR, which enables the system to reuse existing placements and reduce unnecessary recomputation and service migrations. In addition, we conducted an expanded experimental evaluation considering multiple applications, diverse network topologies, and large-scale infrastructures with dynamic failures. The results show that EdgeWiseCR achieves up to 65% faster execution compared to EdgeWise, while preserving placement stability under dynamic conditions.</p></details> |  |

Early engagement is vital for building interest in computing careers and achieving equitable participation. Recent work has shown that the use of sensor-enabled tools and block-based programming can improve engagement and self-efficacy for students from under-represented groups, but these findings lack replication in diverse, resource-constrained settings. This study addresses this gap by implementing sensor-based programming workshops with rural students in Sri Lanka. Replicating methods from the literature, we conduct a between-group study (sensor vs. non-sensor) using Scratch and real-time environmental sensors. We found that students in both groups reported significantly higher confidence in programming in Scratch after the workshop. In addition, average changes in both self-efficacy and outcome expectancy were higher in the experimental (sensor) group than in the control (non-sensor) group, mirroring trends observed in the original study being replicated. We also found that using the sensors helped to enhance creativity and inspired some students to express an interest in information and communications technology (ICT) careers, supporting the value of such hands-on activities in building programming confidence among under-represented groups.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ITiCSE 2025</p></details> |

This opportunistic behavior hinders the effective generation of programs that trigger bugs in compilers and analyzers, even when such programs closely resemble those generated. To address this limitation, we propose bounded exhaustive random program generation, a novel method that focuses the search space of program generation with the aim of more quickly identifying bug-triggering programs. Our approach comprises two stages: 1) generating random program templates, which are incomplete test programs containing bug-related placeholders, and 2) conducting a bounded exhaustive enumeration of valid values for each placeholder within these templates. To ensure efficiency, we maintain a solvable constraint set during the template generation phase and then methodically explore all possible values of placeholders within these constraints during the exhaustive enumeration phase. We have implemented this approach for Solidity, a popular smart contract language for the Ethereum blockchain, in a tool named Erwin. Based on a recent study of Solidity compiler bugs, the placeholders used by Erwin relate to language features commonly associated with compiler bugs. Erwin has successfully identified 23 previously unknown bugs across two Solidity compilers, solc and solang, and one Solidity static analyzer, slither. Evaluation results demonstrate that Erwin outperforms state-of-the-art Solidity fuzzers in bug detection and complements developer-written test suites by covering 4,582 edges and 14,737 lines of the solc compiler that were missed by solc unit tests.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing the Unknown: Exploring Student Interactions with Probeable Problems at Scale in Introductory Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.11723v1)** | 2025-04-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Introductory programming courses often rely on small code-writing exercises that have clearly specified problem statements. This limits opportunities for students to practice how to clarify ambiguous requirements -- a critical skill in real-world programming. In addition, the emerging capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to produce code from well-defined specifications may harm student engagement with traditional programming exercises. This study explores the use of ``Probeable Problems'', automatically gradable tasks that have deliberately vague or incomplete specifications. Such problems require students to submit test inputs, or `probes', to clarify requirements before implementation. Through analysis of over 40,000 probes in an introductory course, we identify patterns linking probing behaviors to task success. Systematic strategies, such as thoroughly exploring expected behavior before coding, resulted in fewer incorrect code submissions and correlated with course success. Feedback from nearly 1,000 participants highlighted the challenges and real-world relevance of these tasks, as well as benefits to critical thinking and metacognitive skills. Probeable Problems are easy to set up and deploy at scale, and help students recognize and resolve uncertainties in programming problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ITiCSE 2025</p></details> |

Despite the extensive research on identifying and quantifying TD, there remains a significant gap in understanding the diversity of TD topics and their temporal development. To address this, we have conducted an explorative analysis of TD data extracted from GitHub issues spanning from 2015 to September 2023. We employed BERTopic for sophisticated topic modelling. This study categorises the TD topics and tracks their progression over time. Furthermore, we have incorporated sentiment analysis for each identified topic, providing a deeper insight into the perceptions and attitudes associated with these topics. This offers a more nuanced understanding of the trends and shifts in TD topics through time, programming language, and repository.</p></details> |  |

A central challenge lies in fast fitness evaluations on large training datasets, especially for complex real-world problems involving time-consuming simulations. Surrogate models, like phenotypic characterization (PC)-based K-nearest neighbors (KNN), have been applied to reduce computational cost. However, the PC-based similarity measure is confined to behavioral characteristics, overlooking genotypic differences, which can limit surrogate quality and impair performance. To address these issues, this paper proposes a pheno-geno unified surrogate GP algorithm, PGU-SGP, integrating phenotypic and genotypic characterization (GC) to enhance surrogate sample selection and fitness prediction. A novel unified similarity metric combining PC and GC distances is proposed, along with an effective and efficient GC representation. Experimental results of a real-life vehicle scheduling problem demonstrate that PGU-SGP reduces training time by approximately 76% while achieving comparable performance to traditional GP. With the same training time, PGU-SGP significantly outperforms traditional GP and the state-of-the-art algorithm on most datasets. Additionally, PGU-SGP shows faster convergence and improved surrogate quality by maintaining accurate fitness rankings and appropriate selection pressure, further validating its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 8 figures, 8 tables.

The fitness evaluation in genetic programming suffers from high computational requirements, limiting the performance on difficult problems. Consequently, there is no efficient genetic programming framework that is usable for a wide range of tasks. To this end, we developed Kozax, a genetic programming framework that evolves symbolic expressions for arbitrary problems. We implemented Kozax using JAX, a framework for high-performance and scalable machine learning, which allows the fitness evaluation to scale efficiently to large populations or datasets on GPU. Furthermore, Kozax offers constant optimization, custom operator definition and simultaneous evolution of multiple trees. We demonstrate successful applications of Kozax to discover equations of natural laws, recover equations of hidden dynamic variables, evolve a control policy and optimize an objective function. Overall, Kozax provides a general, fast, and scalable library to optimize white-box solutions in the realm of scientific computing.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 fig...</summary><p>6 figures, 3 tables, 1 algorithm, 13 pages</p></details> |

The DS obtained, which reveals closely related entities, has been found to be useful in various application domains such as e-commerce, social science, and biology. However, in a big graph that contains billions of edges, it is desirable to find more than one subgraph cluster that is not necessarily the densest, yet they reveal closely related vertices. In this paper, we study the locally densest subgraph (LDS), a recently proposed variant of DS. An LDS is a subgraph which is the densest among the ``local neighbors''. Given a graph $G$, a number of LDSs can be returned, which reflect different dense regions of $G$ and thus give more information than DS. The existing LDS solution suffers from low efficiency. We thus develop a convex-programming-based solution that enables powerful pruning. We also extend our algorithm to triangle-based density to solve LTDS problem. Based on current algorithms, we propose a unified framework for the LDS and LTDS problems. Extensive experiments on thirteen real large graph datasets show that our proposed algorithm is up to four orders of magnitude faster than the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |
| **[Products of Recursive Programs for Hypersafety Verification](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.10800v1)** | 2025-04-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of automated hypersafety verification of infinite-state recursive programs. We propose an infinite class of product programs, specifically designed with recursion in mind, that reduce the hypersafety verification of a recursive program to standard safety verification. For this, we combine insights from language theory and concurrency theory to propose an algorithmic solution for constructing an infinite class of recursive product programs. One key insight is that, using the simple theory of visibly pushdown languages, one can maintain the recursive structure of syntactic program alignments which is vital to constructing a new product program that can be viewed as a classic recursive program -- that is, one that can be executed on a single stack. Another key insight is that techniques from concurrency theory can be generalized to help define product programs based on the view that the parallel composition of individual recursive programs includes all possible alignments from which a sound set of alignments that faithfully preserve the satisfaction of the hypersafety property can be selected. On the practical side, we formulate a family of parametric canonical product constructions that are intuitive to programmers and can be used as building blocks to specify recursive product programs for the purpose of relational and hypersafety verification, with the idea that the right product program can be verified automatically using existing techniques. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques through an implementation and highly promising experimental results.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 pa...</summary><p>23 pages of main text (7 figures) and 13 pages of appendix</p></details> |

One such principle is quantum no-cloning which has led to the emerging field of revocable cryptography. Roughly speaking, in a revocable cryptographic primitive, a cryptographic object (such as a ciphertext or program) is represented as a quantum state in such a way that surrendering it effectively translates into losing the capability to use this cryptographic object. All of the revocable cryptographic systems studied so far have a major drawback: the recipient only receives one copy of the quantum state. Worse yet, the schemes become completely insecure if the recipient receives many identical copies of the same quantum state -- a property that is clearly much more desirable in practice. While multi-copy security has been extensively studied for a number of other quantum cryptographic primitives, it has so far received only little treatment in context of unclonable primitives. Our work, for the first time, shows the feasibility of revocable primitives, such as revocable encryption and revocable programs, which satisfy multi-copy security in oracle models. This suggest that the stronger notion of multi-copy security is within reach in unclonable cryptography more generally, and therefore could lead to a new research direction in the field.</p></details> | 42 pages |

This work presents a computational methodology for searching for pathways in reaction networks which is based on integer linear programming and the modeling of reaction networks by directed hypergraphs. Often multiple pathways fit the given search criteria. To rank them, we develop an objective function based on physical arguments maximizing the probability of the pathway. We furthermore develop an automated pipeline to estimate the energy barriers of individual reactions in reaction networks. Combined, the methodology facilitates flexible and kinetically informed pathway investigations on large reaction networks by computational means, even for networks coming without kinetic annotation, such as those created via generative approaches for expanding molecular spaces.</p></details> |  |

Latency, bandwidth constraints, and the heterogeneity of edge environments hinder the efficiency of centralized cloud solutions. While major cloud providers extend their platforms to the edge, these approaches often overlook its unique characteristics, limiting its potential. To tackle these challenges, we introduce Radon, a flexible programming model and platform designed for the edge-to-cloud continuum. Radon applications are structured as atoms, isolated stateful entities that communicate through messaging and can be composed into complex systems. The Radon runtime, based on WebAssembly (WASM), enables language- and deployment-independent execution, ensuring portability and adaptability across heterogeneous environments. This decoupling allows developers to focus on application logic while the runtime optimizes for diverse infrastructure conditions. We present a prototype implementation of Radon and evaluate its effectiveness through a distributed key-value store case study. We analyze the implementation in terms of code complexity and performance. Our results demonstrate that Radon facilitates the development and operation of scalable applications across the edge-to-cloud continuum advancing the current state-of-the-art.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to EDCCS 2025</p></details> |

Rel is a new relational language whose key design goal is to go beyond this paradigm with features that allow for programming in the large, making it possible to fully describe end to end application semantics. With the new approach we can model the semantics of entire enterprise applications relationally, which helps significantly reduce architecture complexity and avoid the well-known impedance mismatch problem. This paradigm shift is enabled by 50 years of database research, making it possible to revisit the sublanguage/host language paradigm, starting from the fundamental principles. We present the main features of Rel: those that give it the power to express traditional query language operations and those that are designed to grow the language and allow programming in the large.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing code generation models mainly focus on a single or a few programming languages, resulting in unsatisfactory performance in a multilingual environment. Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning can significantly improve the performance of the model without the need for retraining or fine-tuning the code generation model by reasonably decomposing complex code generation tasks into multiple subtasks and gradually deriving solutions for each subtask. Nevertheless, the existing CoT generation methods mainly concentrate on Python code, and the performance on other programming languages remains unclear. To fill this gap, we first constructed a CoT generation dataset for 12 programming languages through multi-agent technology. On this basis, we proposed a CoT generation method MSCoT applicable to multiple programming languages. By introducing CoT into the code generation large model, the performance of the code generation large model in a multilingual environment can be improved. Through large-scale empirical research, we compared the generalization abilities of MSCoT and the existing CoT generation methods on multiple programming languages and proved the effectiveness of MSCoT for multiple programming languages. In addition, we also designed a human study to prove the quality of the CoT generated by MSCoT. Finally, we opensourced the model and dataset of MSCoT to promote the research on CoT generation for multiple programming languages.</p></details> | Accepted |

During the program optimisation process, it would be desirable to have a tool which can automatically verify whether an optimised subprogram can replace the original subprogram. Formally this corresponds to the problem of verifying the strong equivalence of two programs. In order to do so, the translation tool anthem was developed. It can be used in conjunction with an automated theorem prover for classical logic to verify that two programs are strongly equivalent. With the current version of anthem, only the strong equivalence of positive programs with a restricted input language can be verified. This is a result of the translation $\tau^*$ implemented in anthem that produces formulas in the logic of here-and-there, which coincides with classical logic only for positive programs. This thesis extends anthem in order to overcome these limitations. First, the transformation $\sigma^*$ is presented, which transforms formulas from the logic of here-and-there to classical logic. A theorem formalises how $\sigma^*$ can be used to express equivalence in the logic of here-and-there in classical logic. Second, the translation $\tau^*$ is extended to programs containing pools. Another theorem shows how $\sigma^*$ can be combined with $\tau^*$ to express the strong equivalence of two programs in classical logic. With $\sigma^*$ and the extended $\tau^*$, it is possible to express the strong equivalence of logic programs containing negation, simple choices, and pools. Both the extended $\tau^*$ and $\sigma^*$ are implemented in a new version of anthem. Several examples of logic programs containing pools, negation, and simple choice rules, which the new version of anthem can translate to classical logic, are presented.

For example, programs encoding the formal rules and properties of a system have been useful in fields ranging from RL (procedural environments) to physics (simulation engines). These programs can be seen as functions which execute to different outputs based on their parameterizations (e.g., gridworld configuration or initial physical conditions). We introduce the term EFA (Executable Functional Abstraction) to denote such programs for math problems. EFA-like constructs have been shown to be useful for math reasoning as problem generators for stress-testing models. However, prior work has been limited to abstractions for grade-school math (whose simple rules are easy to encode in programs), while generating EFAs for advanced math has thus far required human engineering. We explore the automatic construction of EFAs for advanced math problems. We operationalize the task of automatically constructing EFAs as a program synthesis task, and develop EFAGen, which conditions an LLM on a seed math problem and its step-by-step solution to generate candidate EFA programs that are faithful to the generalized problem and solution class underlying the seed problem. Furthermore, we formalize properties any valid EFA must possess in terms of executable unit tests, and show how the tests can be used as verifiable rewards to train LLMs to become better writers of EFAs. We demonstrate that EFAs constructed by EFAGen behave rationally by remaining faithful to seed problems, produce learnable problem variations, and that EFAGen can infer EFAs across multiple diverse sources of competition-level math problems. Finally, we show downstream uses of model-written EFAs e.g. finding problem variations that are harder or easier for a learner to solve, as well as data generation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Proje...</summary><p>Project Page: https://zaidkhan.me/EFAGen/</p></details> |

However, these problems are often autograded on the correctness of the final submission through test cases, and students cannot get feedback on their planning process. Large language models (LLM) may be able to generate this feedback by detecting the overall code structure even for submissions with syntax errors. To this end, we propose an approach that detects which high-level goals and patterns (i.e. programming plans) exist in a student program with LLMs. We show that both the full GPT-4o model and a small variant (GPT-4o-mini) can detect these plans with remarkable accuracy, outperforming baselines inspired by conventional approaches to code analysis. We further show that the smaller, cost-effective variant (GPT-4o-mini) achieves results on par with state-of-the-art (GPT-4o) after fine-tuning, creating promising implications for smaller models for real-time grading. These smaller models can be incorporated into autograders for open-ended code-writing exercises to provide feedback for students' implicit planning skills, even when their program is syntactically incorrect. Furthermore, LLMs may be useful in providing feedback for problems in other domains where students start with a set of high-level solution steps and iteratively compute the output, such as math and physics problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as full paper at AIED 2025</p></details> |

Automated quantum circuit synthesis via quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising solution, employing trainable parametric quantum circuits to alleviate this. The circuit ansatz in these solutions is often designed through reinforcement learning-based quantum architecture search when the domain knowledge of the problem and hardware are not effective. However, the interpretability of these synthesized circuits remains a significant bottleneck, limiting their scalability and applicability across diverse problem domains. This work addresses the challenge of explainability in quantum architecture search (QAS) by introducing a novel genetic programming-based decompiler framework for reverse-engineering high-level quantum algorithms from low-level circuit representations. The proposed approach, implemented in the open-source tool DeQompile, employs program synthesis techniques, including symbolic regression and abstract syntax tree manipulation, to distill interpretable Qiskit algorithms from quantum assembly language. Validation of benchmark algorithms demonstrates the efficacy of our tool. By integrating the decompiler with online learning frameworks, this research potentiates explainable QAS by fostering the development of generalizable and provable quantum algorithms.</p></details> |  |

Inequality constraints are handled using a primal-dual interior point formulation and step acceptance for equality constraints follows a line-search filter approach.

A single and simple definition is possible, removing this split. A loop is just the limit (a variant of the reflexive transitive closure) of a Noetherian (well-founded) relation. To prove the loop correct there is no need to devise an invariant and a variant; it suffices to identify the relation, yielding both partial correctness and termination. The present note develops the (small) theory and applies it to standard loop examples and proofs of their correctness.</p></details> |  |

To systematically evaluate this capability, we introduce L0-Bench, a language model benchmark for testing procedural correctness -- the ability to generate correct reasoning processes, complementing existing benchmarks that primarily focus on outcome correctness. Given synthetic Python functions with simple operations, L0-Bench grades models on their ability to generate step-by-step, error-free execution traces. The synthetic nature of L0-Bench enables systematic and scalable generation of test programs along various axes (e.g., number of trace steps). We evaluate a diverse array of recent closed-source and open-weight models on a baseline test set. All models exhibit degradation as the number of target trace steps increases, while larger models and reasoning-enhanced models better maintain correctness over multiple steps. Additionally, we use L0-Bench to explore test-time scaling along three dimensions: input context length, number of solutions for majority voting, and inference steps. Our results suggest substantial room to improve "level-0" reasoning and potential directions to build more reliable reasoning systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Genetic Programming with Reinforcement Learning Trained Transformer for Real-World Dynamic Scheduling Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07779v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic scheduling in real-world environments often struggles to adapt to unforeseen disruptions, making traditional static scheduling methods and human-designed heuristics inadequate. This paper introduces an innovative approach that combines Genetic Programming (GP) with a Transformer trained through Reinforcement Learning (GPRT), specifically designed to tackle the complexities of dynamic scheduling scenarios. GPRT leverages the Transformer to refine heuristics generated by GP while also seeding and guiding the evolution of GP. This dual functionality enhances the adaptability and effectiveness of the scheduling heuristics, enabling them to better respond to the dynamic nature of real-world tasks. The efficacy of this integrated approach is demonstrated through a practical application in container terminal truck scheduling, where the GPRT method outperforms traditional GP, standalone Transformer methods, and other state-of-the-art competitors. The key contribution of this research is the development of the GPRT method, which showcases a novel combination of GP and Reinforcement Learning (RL) to produce robust and efficient scheduling solutions. Importantly, GPRT is not limited to container port truck scheduling; it offers a versatile framework applicable to various dynamic scheduling challenges. Its practicality, coupled with its interpretability and ease of modification, makes it a valuable tool for diverse real-world scenarios.</p></details> |  |

A unique adaptive intervention design paradigm is presented in this work, where causal directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) are for effectively recovered with practical budgetary considerations. In order to choose treatments that optimize information gain under these considerations, an iterative integer programming (IP) approach is proposed, which drastically reduces the number of experiments required. Simulations over a broad range of graph sizes and edge densities are used to assess the effectiveness of the suggested approach. Results show that the proposed adaptive IP approach achieves full causal graph recovery with fewer intervention iterations and variable manipulations than random intervention baselines, and it is also flexible enough to accommodate a variety of practical constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Formal Verification of Quantum Error Correcting Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07732v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum error correction (QEC) is fundamental for suppressing noise in quantum hardware and enabling fault-tolerant quantum computation. In this paper, we propose an efficient verification framework for QEC programs. We define an assertion logic and a program logic specifically crafted for QEC programs and establish a sound proof system. We then develop an efficient method for handling verification conditions (VCs) of QEC programs: for Pauli errors, the VCs are reduced to classical assertions that can be solved by SMT solvers, and for non-Pauli errors, we provide a heuristic algorithm. We formalize the proposed program logic in Coq proof assistant, making it a verified QEC verifier. Additionally, we implement an automated QEC verifier, Veri-QEC, for verifying various fault-tolerant scenarios. We demonstrate the efficiency and broad functionality of the framework by performing different verification tasks across various scenarios. Finally, we present a benchmark of 14 verified stabilizer codes.</p></details> | 41 pages, 10 figures |
| **[Parallel Domain-Decomposition Algorithms for Complexity Certification of Branch-and-Bound Algorithms for Mixed-Integer Linear and Quadratic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16411v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When implementing model predictive control (MPC) for hybrid systems with a linear or a quadratic performance measure, a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) or a mixed-integer quadratic program (MIQP) needs to be solved, respectively, at each sampling instant. Recent work has introduced the possibility to certify the computational complexity of branch-and-bound (B&B) algorithms when solving MILP and MIQP problems formulated as multi-parametric MILPs (mp-MILPs) and mp-MIQPs. Such a framework allows for computing the worst-case computational complexity of standard B&B-based MILP and MIQP solvers, quantified by metrics such as the total number of LP/QP iterations and B&B nodes. These results are highly relevant for real-time hybrid MPC applications. In this paper, we extend this framework by developing parallel, domain-decomposition versions of the previously proposed algorithm, allowing it to scale to larger problem sizes and enable the use of high-performance computing (HPC) resources. Furthermore, to reduce peak memory consumption, we introduce two novel modifications to the existing (serial) complexity certification framework, integrating them into the proposed parallel algorithms. Numerical experiments show that the parallel algorithms significantly reduce computation time while maintaining the correctness of the original framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Unifying Complexity-Certification Framework for Branch-and-Bound Algorithms for Mixed-Integer Linear and Quadratic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16235v2)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In model predictive control (MPC) for hybrid systems, solving optimization problems efficiently and with guarantees on worst-case computational complexity is critical to satisfy the real-time constraints in these applications. These optimization problems often take the form of mixed-integer linear programs (MILPs) or mixed-integer quadratic programs (MIQPs) that depend on system parameters. A common approach for solving such problems is the branch-and-bound (B&B) method. This paper extends existing complexity certification methods by presenting a unified complexity-certification framework for B&B-based MILP and MIQP solvers, specifically for the family of multi-parametric MILP and MIQP problems that arise in, e.g., hybrid MPC applications. The framework provides guarantees on worst-case computational measures, including the maximum number of iterations or relaxations B&B algorithms require to reach optimality. It systematically accounts for different branching and node selection strategies, as well as heuristics integrated into B&B, ensuring a comprehensive certification framework. By offering theoretical guarantees and practical insights for solver customization, the proposed framework enhances the reliability of B&B for real-time application. The usefulness of the proposed framework is demonstrated through numerical experiments on both random MILPs and MIQPs, as well as on MIQPs arising from a hybrid MPC problem.</p></details> |  |

We investigate its capabilities in providing high-quality programming tasks to students. Despite promising advancements in task generation, a quality gap remains between AI-generated and expert-created tasks. The AI-generated tasks may not align with target programming concepts, could be incomprehensible for students to solve, or may contain critical issues such as incorrect tests. Existing works often require interventions from human teachers for validation. We address these challenges by introducing PyTaskSyn, a novel synthesis technique that first generates a programming task and then decides whether it meets certain quality criteria to be given to students. The key idea is to break this process into multiple stages performed by expert and student agents simulated using both strong and weaker generative models. Through extensive evaluation, we show that PyTaskSyn significantly improves task quality compared to baseline techniques and showcases the importance of each specialized agent type in our validation pipeline. Additionally, we conducted user studies using our publicly available web application and show that PyTaskSyn can deliver high-quality programming tasks comparable to expert-designed ones while reducing workload and costs, and being more engaging than programming tasks that are available in online resources.</p></details> | AIED'25 paper |
| **[Cache-a-lot: Pushing the Limits of Unsatisfiable Core Reuse in SMT-Based Program Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07642v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solvers are integral to program analysis techniques like concolic and symbolic execution, where they help assess the satisfiability of logical formulae to explore execution paths of the program under test. However, frequent solver invocations are still the main performance bottleneck of these techniques. One way to mitigate this challenge is through optimizations such as caching and reusing solver results. While current methods typically focus on reusing results from fully equivalent or closely related formulas, they often miss broader opportunities for reuse. In this paper, we propose a novel approach, Cache-a-lot, that extends the reuse of unsatisfiable (unsat) results by systematically considering all possible variable substitutions. This enables more extensive reuse of results, thereby reducing the number of SMT solver invocations and improving the overall efficiency of concolic and symbolic execution. Our evaluation, conducted against the state-of-the-art Utopia solution using two benchmark sets, shows significant improvements, particularly with more complex formulas. Our method achieves up to 74% unsat core reuse, compared to Utopia's 41%, and significant increase in the time savings. These results demonstrate that, despite the additional computational complexity, the broader reuse of unsat results significantly enhances performance, offering valuable advancements for formal verification and program analysis.</p></details> |  |

We explore two key frameworks that provide both logical and computational foundations for quantum programming languages. The first framework, the Lambda-$S$ calculus, extends the lambda calculus by incorporating quantum superposition, enforcing linearity, and ensuring unitarity, to model quantum control. Its categorical semantics establishes a structured connection between classical and quantum computation through an adjunction between Cartesian closed categiries and additive symmetric monoidal closed categories. The second framework, the $\mathcal L^{\mathbb C}$ calculus, introduces a proof language for intuitionistic linear logic augmented with sum and scalar operations. This enables the formal encoding of quantum superpositions and measurements, leading to a computational model grounded in categorical structures with biproducts. These approaches suggest a fundamental duality between quantum computation and linear logic, highlighting structural correspondences between logical proofs and quantum programs. We discuss ongoing developments, including extensions to polymorphism, categorical and realizability models, as well as the integration of the modality !, which further solidify the connection between logic and quantum programming languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>Invit...</summary><p>Invited talk at the Quantum Computing session at CiE 2025</p></details> |
| **[Program Skeletons for Automated Program Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07483v1)** | 2025-04-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating software between programming languages is a challenging task, for which automated techniques have been elusive and hard to scale up to larger programs. A key difficulty in cross-language translation is that one has to re-express the intended behavior of the source program into idiomatic constructs of a different target language. This task needs abstracting away from the source language-specific details, while keeping the overall functionality the same. In this work, we propose a novel and systematic approach for making such translation amenable to automation based on a framework we call program skeletons. A program skeleton retains the high-level structure of the source program by abstracting away and effectively summarizing lower-level concrete code fragments, which can be mechanically translated to the target programming language. A skeleton, by design, permits many different ways of filling in the concrete implementation for fragments, which can work in conjunction with existing data-driven code synthesizers. Most importantly, skeletons can conceptually enable sound decomposition, i.e., if each individual fragment is correctly translated, taken together with the mechanically translated skeleton, the final translated program is deemed to be correct as a whole. We present a prototype system called Skel embodying the idea of skeleton-based translation from Python to JavaScript. Our results show promising scalability compared to prior works. For 9 real-world Python programs, some with more than about 1k lines of code, 95% of their code fragments can be automatically translated, while about 5% require manual effort. All the final translations are correct with respect to whole-program test suites.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by PLDI 2025 (46th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation)</p></details> |
| **[Resource-efficient Inference with Foundation Model Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07247v1)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The inference-time resource costs of large language and vision models present a growing challenge in production deployments. We propose the use of foundation model programs, i.e., programs that can invoke foundation models with varying resource costs and performance, as an approach to this problem. Specifically, we present a method that translates a task into a program, then learns a policy for resource allocation that, on each input, selects foundation model "backends" for each program module. The policy uses smaller, cheaper backends to handle simpler subtasks, while allowing more complex subtasks to leverage larger, more capable models. We evaluate the method on two new "streaming" visual question-answering tasks in which a system answers a question on a sequence of inputs, receiving ground-truth feedback after each answer. Compared to monolithic multi-modal models, our implementation achieves up to 98% resource savings with minimal accuracy loss, demonstrating its potential for scalable and resource-efficient multi-modal inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pruner: A Draft-then-Verify Exploration Mechanism to Accelerate Tensor Program Tuning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.02361v3)** | 2025-04-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor program tuning is essential for the efficient deployment of deep neural networks. Search-based approaches have demonstrated scalability and effectiveness in automatically finding high-performance programs for specific hardware. However, the search process is often inefficient, taking hours or even days to discover optimal programs due to the exploration mechanisms guided by an accurate but slow-learned cost model. Meanwhile, the learned cost model trained on one platform cannot seamlessly adapt online to another, which we call cross-platform online unawareness. In this work, we propose Pruner and MoA-Pruner. Pruner is a "Draft-then-Verify" exploration mechanism that accelerates the schedule search process. Instead of applying the complex learned cost model to all explored candidates, Pruner drafts small-scale potential candidates by introducing a naive Symbol-based Analyzer (draft model), then identifies the best candidates by the learned cost model. MoA-Pruner introduces a Momentum online Adaptation strategy to address the cross-platform online unawareness. We incorporate Pruner into the TVM and conduct extensive experiments on three GPU-based platforms. Results show considerable speedup in schedule search time. In online tuning scenarios, Pruner and MoA-Pruner achieve an average speedup of $2.6 \times$ and $4.82 \times$ compared to Ansor. In offline tuning scenarios, Pruner achieves an average speedup of $4.75 \times$ and $4.05\times$ compared to TenSet and TLP, respectively. Furthermore, Pruner achieves an average speedup of $4.08 \times$ compared to MetaSchedule on TensorCore.</p></details> |  |

Evaluating and analyzing their logical reasoning abilities has therefore become essential. However, existing datasets and benchmarks are often limited to overly simplistic, unnatural, or contextually constrained examples. In response to the growing demand, we introduce SmartyPat-Bench, a challenging, naturally expressed, and systematically labeled benchmark derived from real-world high-quality Reddit posts containing subtle logical fallacies. Unlike existing datasets and benchmarks, it provides more detailed annotations of logical fallacies and features more diverse data. To further scale up the study and address the limitations of manual data collection and labeling - such as fallacy-type imbalance and labor-intensive annotation - we introduce SmartyPat, an automated framework powered by logic programming-based oracles. SmartyPat utilizes Prolog rules to systematically generate logically fallacious statements, which are then refined into fluent natural-language sentences by LLMs, ensuring precise fallacy representation. Extensive evaluation demonstrates that SmartyPat produces fallacies comparable in subtlety and quality to human-generated content and significantly outperforms baseline methods. Finally, experiments reveal nuanced insights into LLM capabilities, highlighting that while excessive reasoning steps hinder fallacy detection accuracy, structured reasoning enhances fallacy categorization performance.</p></details> |  |

However, existing uni-modal sewing pattern generation models struggle to effectively encode complex design concepts with a multi-modal nature and correlate them with vectorized sewing patterns that possess precise geometric structures and intricate sewing relations. In this work, we propose a novel sewing pattern generation approach \textbf{Design2GarmentCode} based on Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), to generate parametric pattern-making programs from multi-modal design concepts. LMM offers an intuitive interface for interpreting diverse design inputs, while pattern-making programs could serve as well-structured and semantically meaningful representations of sewing patterns, and act as a robust bridge connecting the cross-domain pattern-making knowledge embedded in LMMs with vectorized sewing patterns. Experimental results demonstrate that our method can flexibly handle various complex design expressions such as images, textual descriptions, designer sketches, or their combinations, and convert them into size-precise sewing patterns with correct stitches. Compared to previous methods, our approach significantly enhances training efficiency, generation quality, and authoring flexibility.</p></details> | <details><summary>The I...</summary><p>The IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (2025)</p></details> |

However, a notable challenge with current manifold learning methods is their lack of explicit functional mappings, crucial for explainability in many real-world applications. Genetic programming, known for its interpretable functional tree-based models, has emerged as a promising approach to address this challenge. Previous research leveraged multi-objective GP to balance manifold quality against embedding dimensionality, producing functional mappings across a range of embedding sizes. Yet, these mapping trees often became complex, hindering explainability. In response, in this paper, we introduce Genetic Programming for Explainable Manifold Learning (GP-EMaL), a novel approach that directly penalises tree complexity. Our new method is able to maintain high manifold quality while significantly enhancing explainability and also allows customisation of complexity measures, such as symmetry balancing, scaling, and node complexity, catering to diverse application needs. Our experimental analysis demonstrates that GP-EMaL is able to match the performance of the existing approach in most cases, while using simpler, smaller, and more interpretable tree structures. This advancement marks a significant step towards achieving interpretable manifold learning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Pre-r...</summary><p>Pre-review pre-print of paper accepted by IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence</p></details> |

Repeatedly evaluating equivalent expressions is inefficient, as it does not immediately lead to better solutions. However, evolutionary algorithms require diversity and should allow the accumulation of inactive building blocks that can play an important role at a later point. The equality graph is a data structure capable of compactly storing expressions and their equivalent forms allowing an efficient verification of whether an expression has been visited in any of their stored equivalent forms. We exploit the e-graph to adapt the subtree operators to reduce the chances of revisiting expressions. Our adaptation, called eggp, stores every visited expression in the e-graph, allowing us to filter out from the available selection of subtrees all the combinations that would create already visited expressions. Results show that, for small expressions, this approach improves the performance of a simple GP algorithm to compete with PySR and Operon without increasing computational cost. As a highlight, eggp was capable of reliably delivering short and at the same time accurate models for a selected set of benchmarks from SRBench and a set of real-world datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 5 figures, 4 tables.

Assigning uniform bit-widths across all layers can result in significant accuracy degradation at low precision and inefficiency at high precision. Mixed-precision quantization (MPQ) addresses this by assigning varied bit-widths to layers, optimizing the accuracy-efficiency trade-off. Existing sensitivity-based methods for MPQ assume that quantization errors across layers are independent, which leads to suboptimal choices. We introduce CLADO, a practical sensitivity-based MPQ algorithm that captures cross-layer dependency of quantization error. CLADO approximates pairwise cross-layer errors using linear equations on a small data subset. Layerwise bit-widths are assigned by optimizing a new MPQ formulation based on cross-layer quantization errors using an Integer Quadratic Program. Experiments with CNN and vision transformer models on ImageNet demonstrate that CLADO achieves state-of-the-art mixed-precision quantization performance.

While traditional methods like technical analysis have long served as foundational tools for traders to recognize and act upon market patterns, the evolving landscape has called for more advanced techniques. We explore the use of Vectorial Genetic Programming (VGP) for this task, introducing two new variants of VGP, one that allows operations with complex numbers and another that implements a strongly-typed version of VGP. We evaluate the different variants on three financial instruments, with datasets spanning more than seven years. Despite the inherent difficulty of this task, it was possible to evolve profitable trading strategies. A comparative analysis of the three VGP variants and standard GP revealed that standard GP is always among the worst whereas strongly-typed VGP is always among the best.</p></details> | 9 pages, 6 figures |

Existing temporal reasoning frameworks operate at the level of models such as traces and automata. Reasoning happens at a very low-level, requiring complex nested (co-)inductive proof techniques and familiarity with proof assistant mechanics (e.g., the guardedness checker). Further, reasoning at the level of models instead of program constructs creates a verification gap that loses the benefits of modularity and composition enjoyed by structural program logics such as Hoare Logic. To address this verification gap, and the lack of compositional proof techniques for temporal specifications, we propose Ticl, a new structural temporal logic. Using ticl, we encode complex (co-)inductive proof techniques as structural lemmas and focus our reasoning on variants and invariants. We show that it is possible to perform compositional proofs of general temporal properties in a proof assistant, while working at a high level of abstraction. We demonstrate the benefits of Ticl by giving mechanized proofs of safety and liveness properties for programs with scheduling, concurrent shared memory, and distributed consensus, demonstrating a low proof-to-code ratio.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Constraint Programming Model For Serial Batch Scheduling With Minimum Batch Size](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.08793v1)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In serial batch (s-batch) scheduling, jobs are grouped in batches and processed sequentially within their batch. This paper considers multiple parallel machines, nonidentical job weights and release times, and sequence-dependent setup times between batches of different families. Although s-batch has been widely studied in the literature, very few papers have taken into account a minimum batch size, typical in practical settings such as semiconductor manufacturing and the metal industry. The problem with this minimum batch size requirement has been mostly tackled with dynamic programming and meta-heuristics, and no article has ever used constraint programming (CP) to do so. This paper fills this gap by proposing, for the first time, a CP model for s-batching with minimum batch size. The computational experiments on standard cases compare the CP model with two existing mixed-integer programming (MIP) models from the literature. The results demonstrate the versatility of the proposed CP model to handle multiple variations of s-batching; and its ability to produce, in large instances, better solutions than the MIP models faster.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

Quantum-specific linting tools, such as LintQ, have been developed to detect quantum-specific programming problems; however, they typically rely on manually crafted analysis queries. The manual effort required to update these tools limits their adaptability to evolving quantum programming practices. To address this challenge, this study investigates the feasibility of employing Large Language Models (LLMs) to develop a novel linting technique for quantum software development and explores potential avenues to advance linting approaches. We introduce LintQ-LLM, an LLM-based linting tool designed to detect quantum-specific problems comparable to those identified by LintQ. Through an empirical comparative study using real-world Qiskit programs, our results show that LintQ-LLM is a viable solution that complements LintQ, with particular strengths in problem localization, explanation clarity, and adaptability potential for emerging quantum programming frameworks, thus providing a basis for further research. Furthermore, this study discusses several research opportunities for developing more advanced, adaptable, and feedback-aware quantum software quality assurance methods by leveraging LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Normal Nested Answer Set Programs: Syntactics, Semantics and Logical Calculi](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.06407v2)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nested answer set programming (NASP; Lifschitz et al., 1999) generalizes answer set programming (ASP) by admitting nested expressions in rule bodies and heads, and thus, NASP aims at exploiting program succinctness. Yet, although NASP expressiveness is undoubtedly superior to ASP one, the former's reasoning capabilities remain unexplored. This reality seems subsequent to the next existing wide-ranging gap: normal nested programs (NNPs) are not known, or in other words, the nested normal-disjunctive boundary is unidentified thus far. Such an unfavorable situation is yet antagonistic to that of ASP as its normal programs (NPs) have been vital for propelling ASP. We will fill such a gap by defining the NNPs, their semantics and their associated nested logical calculi. Besides, while the unique known way to compute nested programs is unfold them back, we propose to do so in their original form. Firstly, we give the syntax of NNPs. For that, we initially define the positive-Horn nested-expressions and then an NNP rule as one whose head (resp. body) is a positive-Horn (resp. general) nested-expression. Secondly, we set up the semantics of NNPs by lifting to the nesting level, classical NP notions including: answer set, minimal and least model, closedness, supported-ness, immediate consequence operator and program consistency. We besides show that NNP restricted to ASP coincides with NP. Thirdly, we introduce nested logical calculi, concretely, nested unit-resolution and nested hyper unit-resolution, proving that they recover unit-resolution and hyper unit-resolution in the ASP setting. We also show how both nested logical calculi allow to process the least model of not-free NNP programs. To end, we demonstrate that computing answer sets of (resp. not-free) NNP programs is (resp. P-complete) NP-complete.</p></details> |  |

However, many of these tools operate independently from institutional Learning Management Systems, which creates a significant disconnect. This isolation limits the ability to leverage learning materials and exercise context for generating tailored, context-aware feedback. Furthermore, previous research on self-regulated learning and LLM support mainly focused on knowledge acquisition, not the development of important self-regulation skills. To address these challenges, we developed CodeRunner Agent, an LLM-based programming assistant that integrates the CodeRunner, a student-submitted code executing and automated grading plugin in Moodle. CodeRunner Agent empowers educators to customize AI-generated feedback by incorporating detailed context from lecture materials, programming questions, student answers, and execution results. Additionally, it enhances students' self-regulated learning by providing strategy-based AI responses. This integrated, context-aware, and skill-focused approach offers promising avenues for data-driven improvements in programming education.</p></details> |  |
| **[Parallel Batch Scheduling With Incompatible Job Families Via Constraint Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11981v3)** | 2025-04-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the incompatible case of parallel batch scheduling, where compatible jobs belong to the same family, and jobs from different families cannot be processed together in the same batch. The state-of-the-art constraint programming (CP) model for this problem relies on specific functions and global constraints only available in a well established commercial CP solver. This paper expands the literature around this problem by proposing four new CP models that can be implemented in commercial and open-source solvers: a new model that relies on automaton constraints, and three alternative models that integrate assignment and scheduling decisions with different strategies and global constraints. Extensive computational experiments on standard test cases under multiple objectives and multiple solvers demonstrate the implementation flexibility and competitive performance of the proposed models.</p></details> | 16 pages, 9 figures |
| **[High Probability Complexity Bounds of Trust-Region Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming with Heavy-Tailed Noise](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19091v2)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we consider nonlinear optimization problems with a stochastic objective and deterministic equality constraints. We propose a Trust-Region Stochastic Sequential Quadratic Programming (TR-SSQP) method and establish its high-probability iteration complexity bounds for identifying first- and second-order $\epsilon$-stationary points. In our algorithm, we assume that exact objective values, gradients, and Hessians are not directly accessible but can be estimated via zeroth-, first-, and second-order probabilistic oracles. Compared to existing complexity studies of SSQP methods that rely on a zeroth-order oracle with sub-exponential tail noise (i.e., light-tailed) and focus mostly on first-order stationarity, our analysis accommodates irreducible and heavy-tailed noise in the zeroth-order oracle and significantly extends the analysis to second-order stationarity. We show that under heavy-tailed noise conditions, our SSQP method achieves the same high-probability first-order iteration complexity bounds as in the light-tailed noise setting, while further exhibiting promising second-order iteration complexity bounds. Specifically, the method identifies a first-order $\epsilon$-stationary point in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations and a second-order $\epsilon$-stationary point in $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-3})$ iterations with high probability, provided that $\epsilon$ is lower bounded by a constant determined by the irreducible noise level in estimation. We validate our theoretical findings and evaluate the practical performance of our method on CUTEst benchmark test set.</p></details> | 50 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Distributed Mixed-Integer Quadratic Programming for Mixed-Traffic Intersection Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04618v1)** | 2025-04-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a distributed algorithm utilizing the proximal alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) in conjunction with sequential constraint tightening to address mixed-integer quadratic programming (MIQP) problems associated with traffic light systems and connected automated vehicles (CAVs) in mixed-traffic intersections. We formulate a comprehensive MIQP model aimed at optimizing the coordination of traffic light systems and CAVs, thereby fully capitalizing on the advantages of CAV integration under conditions of high penetration rates. To effectively approximate the intricate multi-agent MIQP challenges, we develop a distributed algorithm that employs proximal ADMM for solving the convex relaxation of the MIQP while systematically tightening the constraint coefficients to uphold integrality requirements. The performance of our control framework and the efficacy of the distributed algorithm are rigorously validated through a series of simulations conducted across varying penetration rates and traffic volumes.</p></details> | 13 pages |

| **[Automated Assessment in Mobile Programming Courses: Leveraging GitHub Classroom and Flutter for Enhanced Student Outcomes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04230v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The growing demand for skilled mobile developers has made mobile programming courses an essential component of computer science curricula. However, these courses face unique challenges due to the complexity of mobile development environments and the graphical, interactive nature of mobile applications. This paper explores the potential of using GitHub Classroom, combined with the Flutter framework, for the automated assessment of mobile programming assignments. By leveraging GitHub Actions for continuous integration and Flutter's robust support for test automation, the proposed approach enables an auto-grading cost-effective solution. We evaluate the feasibility of integrating these tools through an experiment in a Mobile Programming course and present findings from a student survey that assesses their perceptions of the proposed evaluation model. The results are encouraging, showing that the approach is well-received by students.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ranking and Invariants for Lower-Bound Inference in Quantitative Verification of Probabilistic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04132v1)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantitative properties of probabilistic programs are often characterised by the least fixed point of a monotone function $K$. Giving lower bounds of the least fixed point is crucial for quantitative verification. We propose a new method for obtaining lower bounds of the least fixed point. Drawing inspiration from the verification of non-probabilistic programs, we explore the relationship between the uniqueness of fixed points and program termination, and then develop a framework for lower-bound verification. We introduce a generalisation of ranking supermartingales, which serves as witnesses to the uniqueness of fixed points. Our method can be applied to a wide range of quantitative properties, including the weakest preexpectation, expected runtime, and higher moments of runtime. We provide a template-based algorithm for the automated verification of lower bounds. Our implementation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed method via an experiment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextual Augmented Multi-Model Programming (CAMP): A Hybrid Local-Cloud Copilot Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15285v2)** | 2025-04-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancements in cloud-based Large Languages Models (LLMs) have revolutionized AI-assisted programming. However, their integration into certain local development environments like ones within the Apple software ecosystem (e.g., iOS apps, macOS) remains challenging due to computational demands and sandboxed constraints. This paper presents CAMP, a multi-model AI-assisted programming framework that consists of a local model that employs Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to retrieve contextual information from the codebase to facilitate context-aware prompt construction thus optimizing the performance of the cloud model, empowering LLMs' capabilities in local Integrated Development Environments (IDEs). The methodology is actualized in Copilot for Xcode, an AI-assisted programming tool crafted for Xcode that employs the RAG module to address software constraints and enables diverse generative programming tasks, including automatic code completion, documentation, error detection, and intelligent user-agent interaction. The results from objective experiments on generated code quality and subjective experiments on user adoption collectively demonstrate the pilot success of the proposed system and mark its significant contributions to the realm of AI-assisted programming.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work is accepted to IEEE CAI2025</p></details> |
| **[Diverse In-Context Example Selection After Decomposing Programs and Aligned Utterances Improves Semantic Parsing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03541v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs are increasingly used as seq2seq translators from natural language utterances to structured programs, a process called semantic interpretation. Unlike atomic labels or token sequences, programs are naturally represented as abstract syntax trees (ASTs). Such structured representation raises novel issues related to the design and selection of in-context examples (ICEs) presented to the LLM. We focus on decomposing the pool of available ICE trees into fragments, some of which may be better suited to solving the test instance. Next, we propose how to use (additional invocations of) an LLM with prompted syntax constraints to automatically map the fragments to corresponding utterances. Finally, we adapt and extend a recent method for diverse ICE selection to work with whole and fragmented ICE instances. We evaluate our system, SCUD4ICL, on popular diverse semantic parsing benchmarks, showing visible accuracy gains from our proposed decomposed diverse demonstration method. Benefits are particularly notable for smaller LLMs, ICE pools having larger labeled trees, and programs in lower resource languages.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear at NAACL 2025 (Main)</p></details> |
| **[Programming Distributed Collective Processes in the eXchange Calculus](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.11212v3)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent trends like the Internet of Things (IoT) suggest a vision of dense and multi-scale deployments of computing devices in nearly all kinds of environments. A prominent engineering challenge revolves around programming the collective adaptive behaviour of such computational ecosystems. This requires abstractions able to capture concepts like ensembles (dynamic groups of cooperating devices) and collective tasks (joint activities carried out by ensembles). In this work, we consider collections of devices interacting with neighbours and that execute in nearly-synchronised sense-compute-interact rounds, where the computation is given by a single program mapping sensing values and incoming messages to output and outcoming messages. To support programming whole computational collectives, we propose the abstraction of a distributed collective process, which can be used to define at once the ensemble formation logic and its collective task. We formalise the abstraction in the eXchange Calculus (XC), a core functional language based on neighbouring values (maps from neighbours to values) where state and interaction is handled through a single primitive, exchange, and provide a corresponding implementation in the FCPP language. Then, we exercise distributed collective processes using two case studies: multi-hop message propagation and distributed monitoring of spatial properties. Finally, we discuss the features of the abstraction and its suitability for different kinds of distributed computing applications.</p></details> | 41 pages, 17 figures |
| **[PyTorchGeoNodes: Enabling Differentiable Shape Programs for 3D Shape Reconstruction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.10620v2)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose PyTorchGeoNodes, a differentiable module for reconstructing 3D objects and their parameters from images using interpretable shape programs. Unlike traditional CAD model retrieval, shape programs allow reasoning about semantic parameters, editing, and a low memory footprint. Despite their potential, shape programs for 3D scene understanding have been largely overlooked. Our key contribution is enabling gradient-based optimization by parsing shape programs, or more precisely procedural models designed in Blender, into efficient PyTorch code. While there are many possible applications of our PyTochGeoNodes, we show that a combination of PyTorchGeoNodes with genetic algorithm is a method of choice to optimize both discrete and continuous shape program parameters for 3D reconstruction and understanding of 3D object parameters. Our modular framework can be further integrated with other reconstruction algorithms, and we demonstrate one such integration to enable procedural Gaussian splatting. Our experiments on the ScanNet dataset show that our method achieves accurate reconstructions while enabling, until now, unseen level of 3D scene understanding.</p></details> | Accepted at CVPR |
| **[Extending Data Spatial Semantics for Scale Agnostic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03109v1)** | 2025-04-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce extensions to Data Spatial Programming (DSP) that enable scale-agnostic programming for application development. Building on DSP's paradigm shift from data-to-compute to compute-to-data, we formalize additional intrinsic language constructs that abstract persistent state, multi-user contexts, multiple entry points, and cross-machine distribution for applications. By introducing a globally accessible root node and treating walkers as potential entry points, we demonstrate how programs can be written once and executed across scales, from single-user to multi-user, from local to distributed, without modification. These extensions allow developers to focus on domain logic while delegating runtime concerns of persistence, multi-user support, distribution, and API interfacing to the execution environment. Our approach makes scale-agnostic programming a natural extension of the topological semantics of DSP, allowing applications to seamlessly transition from single-user to multi-user scenarios, from ephemeral to persistent execution contexts, and from local to distributed execution environments.</p></details> | 16 pages |
| **[Unlocking the AMD Neural Processing Unit for ML Training on the Client Using Bare-Metal-Programming Tools](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03083v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There has been a growing interest in executing machine learning (ML) workloads on the client side for reasons of customizability, privacy, performance, and availability. In response, hardware manufacturers have begun to incorporate so-called Neural Processing Units (NPUs) into their processors for consumer devices. Such dedicated hardware optimizes both power efficiency and throughput for common machine learning tasks. AMD's NPU, part of their Ryzen AI processors, is one of the first such accelerators integrated into a chip with an x86 processor. AMD supports bare-metal programming of their NPU rather than limiting programmers to pre-configured libraries. In this paper, we explore the potential of using a bare-metal toolchain to accelerate the weight fine-tuning of a large language model, GPT-2, entirely on the client side using the AMD NPU. Fine-tuning on the edge allows for private customization of a model to a specific use case. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time such an accelerator has been used to perform training on the client side. We offload time-intensive matrix multiplication operations from the CPU onto the NPU, achieving a speedup of over 2.8x for these operations. This improves end-to-end performance of the model in terms of throughput (1.7x and 1.2x speedup in FLOPS/s on mains and battery power, respectively) and energy efficiency (1.4x improvement in FLOPS/Ws on battery power). We detail our implementation approach and present an in-depth exploration of the NPU hardware and bare-metal tool-flow.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 pa...</summary><p>10 pages, 8 figures; abridged version to appear in the 33rd IEEE International Symposium on Field-Programmable Custom Computing Machines (FCCM), 2025</p></details> |
| **[BOOST: Bootstrapping Strategy-Driven Reasoning Programs for Program-Guided Fact-Checking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.02467v1)** | 2025-04-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program-guided reasoning has shown promise in complex claim fact-checking by decomposing claims into function calls and executing reasoning programs. However, prior work primarily relies on few-shot in-context learning (ICL) with ad-hoc demonstrations, which limit program diversity and require manual design with substantial domain knowledge. Fundamentally, the underlying principles of effective reasoning program generation still remain underexplored, making it challenging to construct effective demonstrations. To address this, we propose BOOST, a bootstrapping-based framework for few-shot reasoning program generation. BOOST explicitly integrates claim decomposition and information-gathering strategies as structural guidance for program generation, iteratively refining bootstrapped demonstrations in a strategy-driven and data-centric manner without human intervention. This enables a seamless transition from zero-shot to few-shot strategic program-guided learning, enhancing interpretability and effectiveness. Experimental results show that BOOST outperforms prior few-shot baselines in both zero-shot and few-shot settings for complex claim verification.</p></details> | 18 pages, 5 figures |
