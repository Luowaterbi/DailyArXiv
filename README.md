| **[RECODE-H: A Benchmark for Research Code Development with Interactive Human Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06186v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) show the promise in supporting scientific research implementation, yet their ability to generate correct and executable code remains limited. Existing works largely adopt one-shot settings, ignoring the iterative and feedback-driven nature of realistic workflows of scientific research development. To address this gap, we present RECODE-H, a benchmark of 102 tasks from research papers and repositories that evaluates LLM agents through multi-turn interactions with LLM-simulated human feedback. It includes structured instructions,unit tests, and a five-level feedback hierarchy to reflect realistic researcher-agent collaboration. We further present ReCodeAgent, a framework that integrates feedback into iterative code generation. Experiments with leading LLMs, including GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, DeepSeek-V3.1, and Gemini 2.5, show substantial performance gains with richer feedback, while also highlighting ongoing challenges in the generation of complex research code. RECODE-H establishes a foundation for developing adaptive, feedback-driven LLM agents in scientific research implementation</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code and dataset are available at github.com/ChunyuMiao98/RECODE</p></details> |
| **[Huxley-GÃ¶del Machine: Human-Level Coding Agent Development by an Approximation of the Optimal Self-Improving Machine](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21614v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies operationalize self-improvement through coding agents that edit their own codebases. They grow a tree of self-modifications through expansion strategies that favor higher software engineering benchmark performance, assuming that this implies more promising subsequent self-modifications. However, we identify a mismatch between the agent's self-improvement potential (metaproductivity) and its coding benchmark performance, namely the Metaproductivity-Performance Mismatch. Inspired by Huxley's concept of clade, we propose a metric ($\mathrm{CMP}$) that aggregates the benchmark performances of the descendants of an agent as an indicator of its potential for self-improvement. We show that, in our self-improving coding agent development setting, access to the true $\mathrm{CMP}$ is sufficient to simulate how the G\"odel Machine would behave under certain assumptions. We introduce the Huxley-G\"odel Machine (HGM), which, by estimating $\mathrm{CMP}$ and using it as guidance, searches the tree of self-modifications. On SWE-bench Verified and Polyglot, HGM outperforms prior self-improving coding agent development methods while using less wall-clock time. Last but not least, HGM demonstrates strong transfer to other coding datasets and large language models. The agent optimized by HGM on SWE-bench Verified with GPT-5-mini and evaluated on SWE-bench Lite with GPT-5 achieves human-level performance, matching the best officially checked results of human-engineered coding agents. Our code is available at https://github.com/metauto-ai/HGM.</p></details> |  |
| **[Source-Coded Online Algorithm for Multicast Subgraph Construction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21580v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multicast remains a fundamental mechanism for scalable content distribution, yet existing approaches face critical limitations. Traditional multicast trees suffer from path redundancy and inefficient utilization of network resources, while network coding, although capacity-achieving, incurs significant computational overhead and deployment challenges. In this paper, we introduce a source-coded multicast framework that exploits maximum-flow decomposition to construct multiple disjoint or partially overlapping paths from the source to all receivers. Our scheme incorporates a novel path redirection mechanism: when multiple overlaps occur between receiver flows, downstream paths are realigned at the first intersection, ensuring loop-free delivery while maximizing overall throughput. We develop algorithms for path construction, overlap detection, and iterative refinement of multicast subgraphs, and analyze their computational complexity. Through extensive evaluation on synthetic and real network topologies, we demonstrate that the proposed method consistently approaches the throughput of network coding with substantially lower encoding and decoding complexity, while significantly outperforming multicast tree constructions in terms of fairness, robustness to link failures, and delivery efficiency. These results position source-coded multicast as a practical and scalable solution for next-generation networks requiring high-throughput and adaptive group communication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Wisdom and Delusion of LLM Ensembles for Code Generation and Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21513v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Today's pursuit of a single Large Language Model (LMM) for all software engineering tasks is resource-intensive and overlooks the potential benefits of complementarity, where different models contribute unique strengths. However, the degree to which coding LLMs complement each other and the best strategy for maximizing an ensemble's potential are unclear, leaving practitioners without a clear path to move beyond single-model systems. To address this gap, we empirically compare ten individual LLMs from five families, and three ensembles of these LLMs across three software engineering benchmarks covering code generation and program repair. We assess the complementarity between models and the performance gap between the best individual model and the ensembles. Next, we evaluate various selection heuristics to identify correct solutions from an ensemble's candidate pool. We find that the theoretical upperbound for an ensemble's performance can be 83% above the best single model. Our results show that consensus-based strategies for selecting solutions fall into a "popularity trap," amplifying common but incorrect outputs. In contrast, a diversity-based strategy realizes up to 95% of this theoretical potential, and proves effective even in small two-model ensembles, enabling a cost-efficient way to enhance performance by leveraging multiple LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Reliable Code-as-Policies: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Embodied Task Planning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21302v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have enabled the automatic generation of executable code for task planning and control in embodied agents such as robots, demonstrating the potential of LLM-based embodied intelligence. However, these LLM-based code-as-policies approaches often suffer from limited environmental grounding, particularly in dynamic or partially observable settings, leading to suboptimal task success rates due to incorrect or incomplete code generation. In this work, we propose a neuro-symbolic embodied task planning framework that incorporates explicit symbolic verification and interactive validation processes during code generation. In the validation phase, the framework generates exploratory code that actively interacts with the environment to acquire missing observations while preserving task-relevant states. This integrated process enhances the grounding of generated code, resulting in improved task reliability and success rates in complex environments. We evaluate our framework on RLBench and in real-world settings across dynamic, partially observable scenarios. Experimental results demonstrate that our framework improves task success rates by 46.2% over Code-as-Policies baselines and attains over 86.8% executability of task-relevant actions, thereby enhancing the reliability of task planning in dynamic environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 Spotlight</p></details> |
| **[RethinkMCTS: Refining Erroneous Thoughts in Monte Carlo Tree Search for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.09584v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tree search methods have demonstrated impressive performance in code generation. Previous methods combine tree search with reflection that summarizes past mistakes to achieve iterative improvement. However, these methods face significant challenges. First, they search directly within the code language space, neglecting the underlying reasoning process critical for effective code generation. Second, reflection-based approaches merely accumulate historical errors in memory without providing correct reasoning pathways, making it difficult for subsequent search iterations to identify optimal solutions, resulting in decreased search quality. In this work, we propose RethinkMCTS, a framework that systematically explores and refines the reasoning process for code generation. Specifically, we employ MCTS to search for thoughts before code generation and integrate MCTS with a refinement mechanism called rethink, which incorporates fine-grained code execution feedback to refine erroneous thoughts during the search. It ensures the search path aligns with better reasoning, improving overall search quality. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that RethinkMCTS outperforms previous search-based and feedback-enhanced code generation baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Hierarchical Error Framework for Reliable Automated Coding in Communication Research: Applications to Health and Political Communication](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24841v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated content analysis increasingly supports communication research, yet scaling manual coding into computational pipelines raises concerns about measurement reliability and validity. We introduce a Hierarchical Error Correction (HEC) framework that treats model failures as layered measurement errors (knowledge gaps, reasoning limitations, and complexity constraints) and targets the layers that most affect inference. The framework implements a three-phase methodology: systematic error profiling across hierarchical layers, targeted intervention design matched to dominant error sources, and rigorous validation with statistical testing. Evaluating HEC across health communication (medical specialty classification) and political communication (bias detection), and legal tasks, we validate the approach with five diverse large language models. Results show average accuracy gains of 11.2 percentage points (p < .001, McNemar's test) and stable conclusions via reduced systematic misclassification. Cross-model validation demonstrates consistent improvements (range: +6.8 to +14.6pp), with effectiveness concentrated in moderate-to-high baseline tasks (50-85% accuracy). A boundary study reveals diminished returns in very high-baseline (>85%) or precision-matching tasks, establishing applicability limits. We map layered errors to threats to construct and criterion validity and provide a transparent, measurement-first blueprint for diagnosing error profiles, selecting targeted interventions, and reporting reliability/validity evidence alongside accuracy. This applies to automated coding across communication research and the broader social sciences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Versi...</summary><p>Version 2: Enhanced clarification of precision-matching task characteristics and framework applicability conditions. 20 pages, 4 figures, 4 tables.

| **[TaskEval: Assessing Difficulty of Code Generation Tasks for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.21227v3)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in code-related tasks like code generation, but benchmark evaluations often overlook task characteristics, such as difficulty. Moreover, benchmarks are usually built using tasks described with a single prompt, despite the formulation of prompts having a profound impact on the outcome. This paper introduces a generalist approach, TaskEval, a framework using diverse prompts and Item Response Theory (IRT) to efficiently assess LLMs' capabilities and benchmark task characteristics, improving the understanding of their performance. Using two code generation benchmarks, \textit{HumanEval}+ and \textit{ClassEval}, as well as 8 code generation LLMs, we show that \textit{TaskEval} is capable of characterising the properties of tasks. Using topic analysis, we identify and analyse the tasks of 17 and 21 topics within the benchmarks. We also cross-analyse tasks' characteristics with programming constructs (e.g., variable assignment, conditions, etc.) used by LLMs, emphasising some patterns with tasks' difficulty. Finally, we conduct a comparison between the difficulty assessment of tasks by human annotators and LLMs. Orthogonal to current benchmarking evaluation efforts, \textit{TaskEval} can assist researchers and practitioners in fostering better assessments of LLMs. The tasks' characteristics can be used to identify shortcomings within existing benchmarks or improve the evaluation of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology</p></details> |
| **[Ensuring Functional Correctness of Large Code Models with Selective Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13553v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The hallucination of code generation models hinders their applicability to systems requiring higher safety standards. One critical bottleneck in addressing code hallucination is the difficulty of identifying the functional correctness of generated code, due to its unnatural form. We address this core bottleneck by automatically generating unit tests using dynamic code analysis tools, leveraging the \emph{executable nature} of code. Accordingly, we propose \emph{selective code generator} that abstains from uncertain generations -- based on the functional correctness evaluated by generated unit tests -- to theoretically control the correctness among non-abstained answers, \ie the false discovery rate. Finally, we propose to use generated unit tests in evaluation as well as in learning for precise code evaluation, calling this paradigm \emph{FuzzEval}. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method along with the controllability of code hallucination and reasonable selection efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[PhoenixCodec: Taming Neural Speech Coding for Extreme Low-Resource Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21196v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents PhoenixCodec, a comprehensive neural speech coding and decoding framework designed for extremely low-resource conditions. The proposed system integrates an optimized asymmetric frequency-time architecture, a Cyclical Calibration and Refinement (CCR) training strategy, and a noise-invariant fine-tuning procedure. Under stringent constraints - computation below 700 MFLOPs, latency less than 30 ms, and dual-rate support at 1 kbps and 6 kbps - existing methods face a trade-off between efficiency and quality. PhoenixCodec addresses these challenges by alleviating the resource scattering of conventional decoders, employing CCR to escape local optima, and enhancing robustness through noisy-sample fine-tuning. In the LRAC 2025 Challenge Track 1, the proposed system ranked third overall and demonstrated the best performance at 1 kbps in both real-world noise and reverberation and intelligibility in clean tests, confirming its effectiveness.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 1 figure, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[R2ComSync: Improving Code-Comment Synchronization with In-Context Learning and Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21106v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code-Comment Synchronization (CCS) aims to synchronize the comments with code changes in an automated fashion, thereby significantly reducing the workload of developers during software maintenance and evolution. While previous studies have proposed various solutions that have shown success, they often exhibit limitations, such as a lack of generalization ability or the need for extensive task-specific learning resources. This motivates us to investigate the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) in this area. However, a pilot analysis proves that LLMs fall short of State-Of-The-Art (SOTA) CCS approaches because (1) they lack instructive demonstrations for In-Context Learning (ICL) and (2) many correct-prone candidates are not prioritized.To tackle the above challenges, we propose R2ComSync, an ICL-based code-Comment Synchronization approach enhanced with Retrieval and Re-ranking. Specifically, R2ComSync carries corresponding two novelties: (1) Ensemble hybrid retrieval. It equally considers the similarity in both code-comment semantics and change patterns when retrieval, thereby creating ICL prompts with effective examples. (2) Multi-turn re-ranking strategy. We derived three significant rules through large-scale CCS sample analysis. Given the inference results of LLMs, it progressively exploits three re-ranking rules to prioritize relatively correct-prone candidates. We evaluate R2ComSync using five recent LLMs on three CCS datasets covering both Java and Python programming languages, and make comparisons with five SOTA approaches. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superior performance of R2ComSync against other approaches. Moreover, both quantitative and qualitative analyses provide compelling evidence that the comments synchronized by our proposal exhibit significantly higher quality.}</p></details> |  |
| **[BDiff: Block-aware and Accurate Text-based Code Differencing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.21094v1)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code differencing is a fundamental technique in software engineering practice and research. While researchers have proposed text-based differencing techniques capable of identifying line changes over the past decade, existing methods exhibit a notable limitation in identifying edit actions (EAs) that operate on text blocks spanning multiple lines. Such EAs are common in developers' practice, such as moving a code block for conditional branching or duplicating a method definition block for overloading. Existing tools represent such block-level operations as discrete sequences of line-level EAs, compelling developers to manually correlate them and thereby substantially impeding the efficiency of change comprehension. To address this issue, we propose BDiff, a text-based differencing algorithm capable of identifying two types of block-level EAs and five types of line-level EAs. Building on traditional differencing algorithms, we first construct a candidate set containing all possible line mappings and block mappings. Leveraging the Kuhn-Munkres algorithm, we then compute the optimal mapping set that can minimize the size of the edit script (ES) while closely aligning with the original developer's intent. To validate the effectiveness of BDiff, we selected five state-of-the-art tools, including large language models (LLMs), as baselines and adopted a combined qualitative and quantitative approach to evaluate their performance in terms of ES size, result quality, and running time. Experimental results show that BDiff produces higher-quality differencing results than baseline tools while maintaining competitive runtime performance. Our experiments also show the unreliability of LLMs in code differencing tasks regarding result quality and their infeasibility in terms of runtime efficiency. We have implemented a web-based visual differencing tool.</p></details> |  |

By overlapping a small number of repetition codes, we enhance the asymptotic code rate fourfold. In the minimal-distance case $d = 3$, this construction reduces the overhead from $[[9,1,3]]$ to the more efficient $[[7,1,3]]$ configuration.</p></details> | 4 pages |
| **[Classical Planning with LLM-Generated Heuristics: Challenging the State of the Art with Python Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18809v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable capabilities in various artificial intelligence problems. However, they fail to plan reliably, even when prompted with a detailed definition of the planning task. Attempts to improve their planning capabilities, such as chain-of-thought prompting, fine-tuning, and explicit "reasoning" still yield incorrect plans and usually fail to generalize to larger tasks. In this paper, we show how to use LLMs to generate correct plans, even for out-of-distribution tasks of increasing size. For a given planning domain, we ask an LLM to generate several domain-dependent heuristic functions in the form of Python code, evaluate them on a set of training tasks within a greedy best-first search, and choose the strongest one. The resulting LLM-generated heuristics solve many more unseen test tasks than state-of-the-art domain-independent heuristics for classical planning. They are even competitive with the strongest learning algorithm for domain-dependent planning. These findings are especially remarkable given that our proof-of-concept implementation is based on an unoptimized Python planner and the baselines all build upon highly optimized C++ code. In some domains, the LLM-generated heuristics expand fewer states than the baselines, revealing that they are not only efficiently computable, but sometimes even more informative than the state-of-the-art heuristics. Overall, our results show that sampling a set of planning heuristic function programs can significantly improve the planning capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Code-enabled language models can outperform reasoning models on diverse tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20909v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reasoning models (RMs), language models (LMs) trained with reinforcement learning to produce long-form natural language reasoning, have been remarkably successful, but they still require large amounts of computation and data to train, and can be slow and expensive to run. In this paper, we show that standard instruct LMs can already be elicited to be strong reasoners at a level comparable to or even surpassing their corresponding RMs (e.g., DeepSeek V3 vs R1) without finetuning, across diverse domains from instruction following and creative generation to mathematical reasoning. This is achieved by CodeAdapt, our simple recipe that combines the CodeAct framework, where LMs interleave natural language reasoning with code execution in a multi-step fashion, with few-shot bootstrap in-context learning from as few as five training problems. Analyzing four matched pairs of LMs and RMs, we find that CodeAdapt enables three LMs to outperform the corresponding RMs on average over eight tasks (up to 22.9%) while being 10-81% more token efficient, and delivers superior performance on six tasks when averaged over the four models (up to 35.7%). Furthermore, the code-augmented reasoning traces display rich and varied problem-solving strategies. Our findings support that (1) CodeAdapt-style learning and reasoning may be robust and domain general and (2) code-enabled LMs are cognitively grounded and powerful systems, potentially providing a strong foundation for in-weight reinforcement learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Co-Designing Quantum Codes with Transversal Diagonal Gates via Multi-Agent Systems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20728v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present a multi-agent, human-in-the-loop workflow that co-designs quantum codes with prescribed transversal diagonal gates. It builds on the Subset-Sum Linear Programming (SSLP) framework (arXiv:2504.20847), which partitions basis strings by modular residues and enforces $Z$-marginal Knill-Laflamme (KL) equalities via small LPs. The workflow is powered by GPT-5 and implemented within TeXRA (https://texra.ai)-a multi-agent research assistant platform that supports an iterative tool-use loop agent and a derivation-then-edit workflow reasoning agent. We work in a LaTeX-Python environment where agents reason, edit documents, execute code, and synchronize their work to Git/Overleaf. Within this workspace, three roles collaborate: a Synthesis Agent formulates the problem; a Search Agent sweeps/screens candidates and exactifies numerics into rationals; and an Audit Agent independently checks all KL equalities and the induced logical action. As a first step we focus on distance $d=2$ with nondegenerate residues. For code dimension $K\in\{2,3,4\}$ and $n\le6$ qubits, systematic sweeps yield certificate-backed tables cataloging attainable cyclic logical groups-all realized by new codes-e.g., for $K=3$ we obtain order $16$ at $n=6$. From verified instances, Synthesis Agent abstracts recurring structures into closed-form families and proves they satisfy the KL equalities for all parameters. It further demonstrates that SSLP accommodates residue degeneracy by exhibiting a new $((6,4,2))$ code implementing the transversal controlled-phase $diag(1,1,1,i)$. Overall, the workflow recasts diagonal-transversal feasibility as an analytical pipeline executed at scale, combining systematic enumeration with exact analytical reconstruction. It yields reproducible code constructions, supports targeted extensions to larger $K$ and higher distances, and leads toward data-driven classification.</p></details> | 29 pages, 2 figures |

| **[AlgoTune: Can Language Models Speed Up General-Purpose Numerical Programs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15887v4)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite progress in language model (LM) capabilities, evaluations have thus far focused on models' performance on tasks that humans have previously solved, including in programming (Jimenez et al., 2024) and mathematics (Glazer et al., 2024). We therefore propose testing models' ability to design and implement algorithms in an open-ended benchmark: We task LMs with writing code that efficiently solves computationally challenging problems in computer science, physics, and mathematics. Our AlgoTune benchmark consists of 154 coding tasks collected from domain experts and a framework for validating and timing LM-synthesized solution code, which is compared to reference implementations from popular open-source packages. In addition, we develop a baseline LM agent, AlgoTuner, and evaluate its performance across a suite of frontier models. AlgoTuner uses a simple, budgeted loop that edits code, compiles and runs it, profiles performance, verifies correctness on tests, and selects the fastest valid version. AlgoTuner achieves an average 1.72x speedup against our reference solvers, which use libraries such as SciPy, sk-learn and CVXPY. However, we find that current models fail to discover algorithmic innovations, instead preferring surface-level optimizations. We hope that AlgoTune catalyzes the development of LM agents exhibiting creative problem solving beyond state-of-the-art human performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Principled Data Augmentation for Learning to Solve Quadratic Programming Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.01728v2)** | 2025-10-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear and quadratic optimization are crucial in numerous real-world applications, ranging from training machine learning models to solving integer linear programs. Recently, learning-to-optimize methods (L2O) for linear (LPs) or quadratic programs (QPs) using message-passing graph neural networks (MPNNs) have gained traction, promising lightweight, data-driven proxies for solving such optimization problems. For example, they replace the costly computation of strong branching scores in branch-and-bound solvers, thereby reducing the need to solve many such optimization problems. However, robust L2O MPNNs remain challenging in data-scarce settings, especially when addressing complex optimization problems such as QPs. This work introduces a principled approach to data augmentation tailored for QPs via MPNNs. Our method leverages theoretically justified data augmentation techniques to generate diverse yet optimality-preserving instances. Furthermore, we integrate these augmentations into a self-supervised contrastive learning framework, thereby pretraining MPNNs for improved performance on L2O tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach improves generalization in supervised scenarios and facilitates effective transfer learning to related optimization problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025 as spotlight</p></details> |
| **[Dependent Session Types for Verified Concurrent Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19129v2)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present TLLC which extends the Two-Level Linear dependent type theory (TLL) with session-based concurrency. Equipped with Martin-L\"{o}f style dependency, the session types of TLLC allow protocols to specify properties of communicated messages. When used in conjunction with the dependent type machinery already present in TLL, dependent session types facilitate a form of relational verification by relating concurrent programs with their idealized sequential counterparts. Correctness properties proven for sequential programs can be easily lifted to their corresponding concurrent implementations. TLLC makes session types a powerful tool for intrinsically verifying the correctness of data structures such as queues and concurrent algorithms such as map-reduce. To extend TLL with session types, we develop a novel formulation of intuitionistic session type which we believe to be widely applicable for integrating session types into other type systems beyond the context of TLLC. We study the meta-theory of our language, proving its soundness as both a term calculus and a process calculus. To demonstrate the practicality of TLLC, we have implemented a prototype compiler that translates TLLC programs into concurrent C code, which has been extensively evaluated.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Triage Taint Flows Reported by Dynamic Program Analysis in Node.js Packages](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.20739v1)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program analysis tools often produce large volumes of candidate vulnerability reports that require costly manual review, creating a practical challenge: how can security analysts prioritize the reports most likely to be true vulnerabilities? This paper investigates whether machine learning can be applied to prioritizing vulnerabilities reported by program analysis tools. We focus on Node.js packages and collect a benchmark of 1,883 Node.js packages, each containing one reported ACE or ACI vulnerability. We evaluate a variety of machine learning approaches, including classical models, graph neural networks (GNNs), large language models (LLMs), and hybrid models that combine GNN and LLMs, trained on data based on a dynamic program analysis tool's output. The top LLM achieves $F_{1} {=} 0.915$, while the best GNN and classical ML models reaching $F_{1} {=} 0.904$. At a less than 7% false-negative rate, the leading model eliminates 66.9% of benign packages from manual review, taking around 60 ms per package. If the best model is tuned to operate at a precision level of 0.8 (i.e., allowing 20% false positives amongst all warnings), our approach can detect 99.2% of exploitable taint flows while missing only 0.8%, demonstrating strong potential for real-world vulnerability triage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Solving 0-1 Integer Programs with Unknown Knapsack Constraints Using Membership Oracles](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.14090v4)** | 2025-10-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider solving a combinatorial optimization problem with unknown knapsack constraints using a membership oracle for each unknown constraint such that, given a solution, the oracle determines whether the constraint is satisfied or not with absolute certainty. The goal of the decision maker is to find the best possible solution subject to a budget on the number of oracle calls. Inspired by active learning for binary classification based on Support Vector Machines (SVMs), we devise a framework to solve the problem by learning and exploiting surrogate linear constraints. The framework includes training linear separators on the labeled points and selecting new points to be labeled, which is achieved by applying a sampling strategy and solving a 0-1 integer linear program. Following the active learning literature, a natural choice would be SVM as a linear classifier and the information-based sampling strategy known as simple margin, for each unknown constraint. We improve on both sides: we propose an alternative sampling strategy based on mixed-integer quadratic programming and a linear separation method inspired by an algorithm for convex optimization in the oracle model. We conduct experiments on classical problems and variants inspired by realistic applications to show how different linear separation methods and sampling strategies influence the quality of the results in terms of several metrics including objective value, dual bound and running time.</p></details> |  |
