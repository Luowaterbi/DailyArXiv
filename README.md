| **[Bias Unveiled: Investigating Social Bias in LLM-Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10351v4)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have significantly advanced the field of automated code generation. However, a notable research gap exists in evaluating social biases that may be present in the code produced by LLMs. To solve this issue, we propose a novel fairness framework, i.e., Solar, to assess and mitigate the social biases of LLM-generated code. Specifically, Solar can automatically generate test cases for quantitatively uncovering social biases of the auto-generated code by LLMs. To quantify the severity of social biases in generated code, we develop a dataset that covers a diverse set of social problems. We applied Solar and the crafted dataset to four state-of-the-art LLMs for code generation. Our evaluation reveals severe bias in the LLM-generated code from all the subject LLMs. Furthermore, we explore several prompting strategies for mitigating bias, including Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, combining positive role-playing with CoT prompting and dialogue with Solar. Our experiments show that dialogue with Solar can effectively reduce social bias in LLM-generated code by up to 90%. Last, we make the code and data publicly available is highly extensible to evaluate new social problems.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted for publication in the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI), 2025</p></details> |
| **[Grammar-Based Code Representation: Is It a Worthy Pursuit for LLMs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05507v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grammar serves as a cornerstone in programming languages and software engineering, providing frameworks to define the syntactic space and program structure. Existing research demonstrates the effectiveness of grammar-based code representations in small-scale models, showing their ability to reduce syntax errors and enhance performance. However, as language models scale to the billion level or beyond, syntax-level errors become rare, making it unclear whether grammar information still provides performance benefits. To explore this, we develop a series of billion-scale GrammarCoder models, incorporating grammar rules in the code generation process. Experiments on HumanEval (+) and MBPP (+) demonstrate a notable improvement in code generation accuracy. Further analysis shows that grammar-based representations enhance LLMs' ability to discern subtle code differences, reducing semantic errors caused by minor variations. These findings suggest that grammar-based code representations remain valuable even in billion-scale models, not only by maintaining syntax correctness but also by improving semantic differentiation.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Bot-based Approach to Manage Codes of Conduct in Open-Source Projects](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05479v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The development of Open-Source Software (OSS) projects relies on the collaborative work of contributors, generally scattered around the world. To enable this collaboration, OSS projects are hosted on social-coding platforms like GitHub, which provide the infrastructure to host the code as well as the support for enabling the participation of the community. The potentially rich and diverse mixture of contributors in OSS projects makes their management not only a technical challenge, where automation tools and bots are usually deployed, but also a social one. To this aim, OSS projects have been increasingly deploying a declaration of their code of conduct, which defines rules to ensure a respectful and inclusive participatory environment in the community, being the Contributor Covenant the main model to follow. However, the broad adoption and enforcement of codes of conduct in OSS projects is still limited. In particular, the definition, deployment, and enforcement of codes of conduct is a very challenging task. In this paper, we propose an approach to effectively manage codes of conduct in OSS projects based on the Contributor Covenant proposal. Our solution has been implemented as a bot-based solution where bots help in the definition of codes of conduct, the monitoring of OSS projects, and the enforcement of ethical rules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 2025 IEEE/ACM 47th International Conference on Software Engineering: Software Engineering in Society (ICSE-SEIS)</p></details> |

This task, evaluated on the DataBench dataset, assesses Large Language Models' (LLMs) ability to answer natural language questions over structured data while addressing topic diversity and table size limitations in previous benchmarks. We propose a system that employs effective LLM prompting to translate natural language queries into executable code, enabling accurate responses, error correction, and interpretability. Our approach ranks first in both subtasks of the competition in the proprietary model category, significantly outperforming the organizer's baseline.</p></details> |  |
| **[LoRACode: LoRA Adapters for Code Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05315v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code embeddings are essential for semantic code search; however, current approaches often struggle to capture the precise syntactic and contextual nuances inherent in code. Open-source models such as CodeBERT and UniXcoder exhibit limitations in scalability and efficiency, while high-performing proprietary systems impose substantial computational costs. We introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to construct task-specific adapters for code retrieval. Our approach reduces the number of trainable parameters to less than two percent of the base model, enabling rapid fine-tuning on extensive code corpora (2 million samples in 25 minutes on two H100 GPUs). Experiments demonstrate an increase of up to 9.1% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) for Code2Code search, and up to 86.69% for Text2Code search tasks across multiple programming languages. Distinction in task-wise and language-wise adaptation helps explore the sensitivity of code retrieval for syntactical and linguistic variations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Deep Learning for Code (DL4C) Workshop at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Assisted morbidity coding: the SISCO.web use case for identifying the main diagnosis in Hospital Discharge Records](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.09651v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Coding morbidity data using international standard diagnostic classifications is increasingly important and still challenging. Clinical coders and physicians assign codes to patient episodes based on their interpretation of case notes or electronic patient records. Therefore, accurate coding relies on the legibility of case notes and the coders' understanding of medical terminology. During the last ten years, many studies have shown poor reproducibility of clinical coding, even recently, with the application of Artificial Intelligence-based models. Given this context, the paper aims to present the SISCO.web approach designed to support physicians in filling in Hospital Discharge Records with proper diagnoses and procedures codes using the International Classification of Diseases (9th and 10th), and, above all, in identifying the main pathological condition. The web service leverages NLP algorithms, specific coding rules, as well as ad hoc decision trees to identify the main condition, showing promising results in providing accurate ICD coding suggestions.</p></details> | 18 pages |
| **[How Diversely Can Language Models Solve Problems? Exploring the Algorithmic Diversity of Model-Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00691v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models (LMs) have exhibited impressive abilities in generating code from natural language requirements. In this work, we highlight the diversity of code generated by LMs as a critical criterion for evaluating their code generation capabilities. There is a lack of studies focused on assessing the diversity of generated code, which overlooks its importance in code LMs. Therefore, we propose a systematic approach to evaluate code diversity, introducing various metrics with inter-code similarity. Specifically, we introduce code clustering methods that leverages LMs' capabilities in code understanding and reasoning, resulting in a set of metrics that represent the number of algorithms in model-generated solutions. We extensively investigate the property of model-generated solutions by contrasting them with human-written ones and quantifying the impact of various factors on code diversity: model size, temperature, instruction tuning, and problem complexity. Our analysis demonstrates that model-generated solutions exhibit low algorithmic diversity, which was neglected by the research community. Moreover, we explore methods to increase code diversity by combining solutions from different models and increasing sampling temperatures. Our findings highlight that code diversity can be enhanced with the help of heterogeneous models and setting temperature beyond 1.0 that has not been fully explored due to the functional correctness degradation. To facilitate our research direction, we publicly share our code and datasets through open-source repositories.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quasi-linear time decoding of RS and AG codes for burst errors up to the Singleton bound](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05062v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite of tremendous research on decoding Reed-Solomon (RS) and algebraic geometry (AG) codes under the random and adversary substitution error models, few studies have explored these codes under the burst substitution error model. Burst errors are prevalent in many communication channels, such as wireless networks, magnetic recording systems, and flash memory. Compared to random and adversarial errors, burst errors often allow for the design of more efficient decoding algorithms. However, achieving both an optimal decoding radius and quasi-linear time complexity for burst error correction remains a significant challenge. The goal of this paper is to design (both list and probabilistic unique) decoding algorithms for RS and AG codes that achieve the Singleton bound for decoding radius while maintaining quasi-linear time complexity. Our idea is to build a one-to-one correspondence between AG codes (including RS codes) and interleaved RS codes with shorter code lengths (or even constant lengths). By decoding the interleaved RS codes with burst errors, we derive efficient decoding algorithms for RS and AG codes. For decoding interleaved RS codes with shorter code lengths, we can employ either the naive methods or existing algorithms. This one-to-one correspondence is constructed using the generalized fast Fourier transform (G-FFT) proposed by Li and Xing (SODA 2024). The G-FFT generalizes the divide-and-conquer technique from polynomials to algebraic function fields. More precisely speaking, assume that our AG code is defined over a function field $E$ which has a sequence of subfields $\mathbb{F}_q(x)=E_r\subseteq E_{r-1}\subseteq \cdots\subset E_1\subseteq E_0=E$ such that $E_{i-1}/E_i$ are Galois extensions for $1\le i\le r$. Then the AG code based on $E$ can be transformed into an interleaved RS code over the rational function field $\mathbb{F}_q(x)$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Double Backdoored: Converting Code Large Language Model Backdoors to Traditional Malware via Adversarial Instruction Tuning Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18567v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Instruction-tuned Large Language Models designed for coding tasks are increasingly employed as AI coding assistants. However, the cybersecurity vulnerabilities and implications arising from the widespread integration of these models are not yet fully understood due to limited research in this domain. This work investigates novel techniques for transitioning backdoors from the AI/ML domain to traditional computer malware, shedding light on the critical intersection of AI and cyber/software security. To explore this intersection, we present MalInstructCoder, a framework designed to comprehensively assess the cybersecurity vulnerabilities of instruction-tuned Code LLMs. MalInstructCoder introduces an automated data poisoning pipeline to inject malicious code snippets into benign code, poisoning instruction fine-tuning data while maintaining functional validity. It presents two practical adversarial instruction tuning attacks with real-world security implications: the clean prompt poisoning attack and the backdoor attack. These attacks aim to manipulate Code LLMs to generate code incorporating malicious or harmful functionality under specific attack scenarios while preserving intended functionality. We conduct a comprehensive investigation into the exploitability of the code-specific instruction tuning process involving three state-of-the-art Code LLMs: CodeLlama, DeepSeek-Coder, and StarCoder2. Our findings reveal that these models are highly vulnerable to our attacks. Specifically, the clean prompt poisoning attack achieves the ASR@1 ranging from over 75% to 86% by poisoning only 1% (162 samples) of the instruction fine-tuning dataset. Similarly, the backdoor attack achieves the ASR@1 ranging from 76% to 86% with a 0.5% poisoning rate. Our study sheds light on the critical cybersecurity risks posed by instruction-tuned Code LLMs and highlights the urgent need for robust defense mechanisms.</p></details> |  |
| **[Ultra-Low-Latency Edge Intelligent Sensing: A Source-Channel Tradeoff and Its Application to Coding Rate Adaptation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04645v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The forthcoming sixth-generation (6G) mobile network is set to merge edge artificial intelligence (AI) and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) extensively, giving rise to the new paradigm of edge intelligent sensing (EI-Sense). This paradigm leverages ubiquitous edge devices for environmental sensing and deploys AI algorithms at edge servers to interpret the observations via remote inference on wirelessly uploaded features. A significant challenge arises in designing EI-Sense systems for 6G mission-critical applications, which demand high performance under stringent latency constraints. To tackle this challenge, we focus on the end-to-end (E2E) performance of EI-Sense and characterize a source-channel tradeoff that balances source distortion and channel reliability. In this work, we establish a theoretical foundation for the source-channel tradeoff by quantifying the effects of source coding on feature discriminant gains and channel reliability on packet loss. Building on this foundation, we design the coding rate control by optimizing the tradeoff to minimize the E2E sensing error probability, leading to a low-complexity algorithm for ultra-low-latency EI-Sense. Finally, we validate our theoretical analysis and proposed coding rate control algorithm through extensive experiments on both synthetic and real datasets, demonstrating the sensing performance gain of our approach with respect to traditional reliability-centric methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Equivalence of Families of Polycyclic Codes over Finite Fields](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04498v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the equivalence of families of polycyclic codes associated with polynomials of the form $x^n - a_{n-1}x^{n-1} - \ldots - a_1x - a_0$ over a finite field. We begin with the specific case of polycyclic codes associated with a trinomial $x^n - a_{\ell} x^{\ell} - a_0$ (for some $0< \ell <n$), which we refer to as \textit{$\ell$-trinomial codes}, after which we generalize our results to general polycyclic codes. We introduce an equivalence relation called \textit{$n$-equivalence}, which extends the known notion of $n$-equivalence for constacyclic codes \cite{Chen2014}. We compute the number of $n$-equivalence classes %, $ N_{(n,\ell)}$, for this relation and provide conditions under which two families of polycyclic (or $\ell$-trinomial) codes are equivalent. In particular, we prove that when $\gcd(n, n-\ell) = 1$, any $\ell$-trinomial code family is equivalent to a trinomial code family associated with the polynomial $x^n - x^{\ell} - 1$. Finally, we focus on $p^{\ell}$-trinomial codes of length $p^{\ell+r}$, where $p$ is the characteristic of $\mathbb{F}_q$ and $r$ an integer, and provide some examples as an application of the theory developed in this paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exit the Code: A Model for Understanding Career Abandonment Intention Among Software Developers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04460v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background. Career abandonment, the process in which professionals leave the activity, assuming positions in another area, among software developers involves frustration with the lost investment and emotional and financial costs, even though being beneficial for the human being, depending on personal context. Previous studies have identified work-related motivators for career abandonment, such as the threat of obsolescence, unstable requirements, and low code quality, though these factors have primarily been examined in former developers. The relationship between these motivators and the intention to abandon among currently active developers remains unexplored. Goal. This article investigates the relationship between key work-related motivators and currently active software developers intention to abandon their careers. Method. We employed a quantitative approach, surveying 221 software developers to validate a theoretical model for career abandonment intention, based on an adaptation of the Investment Model, which incorporates satisfaction with technical aspects of the profession as well as the intention to abandon. Findings. Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, through structural equation modeling (SEM), provided robust support for the adapted Investment Model in explaining software developers intention to abandon their careers. Moreover, career commitment significantly impacts the intention to leave the profession, being positively influenced by satisfaction with technical work-related factors and negatively influenced by career alternatives and career investment. Conclusion. The paper offers valuable insights for organizational leaders and research, potentially guiding retention strategies to better support developers, and the adoption of theoretical models to explain career abandonment.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Transformer-based World Models with Contrastive Predictive Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04416v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The DreamerV3 algorithm recently obtained remarkable performance across diverse environment domains by learning an accurate world model based on Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs). Following the success of model-based reinforcement learning algorithms and the rapid adoption of the Transformer architecture for its superior training efficiency and favorable scaling properties, recent works such as STORM have proposed replacing RNN-based world models with Transformer-based world models using masked self-attention. However, despite the improved training efficiency of these methods, their impact on performance remains limited compared to the Dreamer algorithm, struggling to learn competitive Transformer-based world models. In this work, we show that the next state prediction objective adopted in previous approaches is insufficient to fully exploit the representation capabilities of Transformers. We propose to extend world model predictions to longer time horizons by introducing TWISTER (Transformer-based World model wIth contraSTivE Representations), a world model using action-conditioned Contrastive Predictive Coding to learn high-level temporal feature representations and improve the agent performance. TWISTER achieves a human-normalized mean score of 162% on the Atari 100k benchmark, setting a new record among state-of-the-art methods that do not employ look-ahead search.</p></details> |  |
| **[LONGCODEU: Benchmarking Long-Context Language Models on Long Code Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04359v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current advanced long-context language models offer great potential for real-world software engineering applications. However, progress in this critical domain remains hampered by a fundamental limitation: the absence of a rigorous evaluation framework for long code understanding. To gap this obstacle, we propose a long code understanding benchmark LONGCODEU from four aspects (8 tasks) to evaluate LCLMs' long code understanding ability required for practical applications, including code unit perception, intra-code unit understanding, inter-code unit relation understanding, and long code documentation understanding. We evaluate 9 popular LCLMs on LONGCODEU (i.e., 6 general models and 3 code models). Our experimental results reveal key limitations in current LCLMs' capabilities for long code understanding. Particularly, the performance of LCLMs drops dramatically when the long code length is greater than 32K, falling far short of their claimed 128K-1M context windows. In the four aspects, inter-code unit relation understanding is the most challenging for LCLMs. Our study provides valuable insights for optimizing LCLMs and driving advancements in software engineering.</p></details> | 18 pages |

However, the high-dimensional sparsity, batch effect noise, category imbalance, and ever-increasing data scale of the original sequencing data pose significant challenges for multi-center knowledge transfer, data fusion, and cross-validation between scRNA-seq datasets. To address these barriers, (1) we first propose a latent codes-based scRNA-seq dataset distillation framework named scDD, which transfers and distills foundation model knowledge and original dataset information into a compact latent space and generates synthetic scRNA-seq dataset by a generator to replace the original dataset. Then, (2) we propose a single-step conditional diffusion generator named SCDG, which perform single-step gradient back-propagation to help scDD optimize distillation quality and avoid gradient decay caused by multi-step back-propagation. Meanwhile, SCDG ensures the scRNA-seq data characteristics and inter-class discriminability of the synthetic dataset through flexible conditional control and generation quality assurance. Finally, we propose a comprehensive benchmark to evaluate the performance of scRNA-seq dataset distillation in different data analysis tasks. It is validated that our proposed method can achieve 7.61% absolute and 15.70% relative improvement over previous state-of-the-art methods on average task.</p></details> |  |
| **[Codebook Reduction and Saturation: Novel observations on Inductive Thematic Saturation for Large Language Models and initial coding in Thematic Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04859v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper reflects on the process of performing Thematic Analysis with Large Language Models (LLMs). Specifically, the paper deals with the problem of analytical saturation of initial codes, as produced by LLMs. Thematic Analysis is a well-established qualitative analysis method composed of interlinked phases. A key phase is the initial coding, where the analysts assign labels to discrete components of a dataset. Saturation is a way to measure the validity of a qualitative analysis and relates to the recurrence and repetition of initial codes. In the paper we reflect on how well LLMs achieve analytical saturation and propose also a novel technique to measure Inductive Thematic Saturation (ITS). This novel technique leverages a programming framework called DSPy. The proposed novel approach allows a precise measurement of ITS.</p></details> |  |

Current solutions face three challenges: 1) Cloud-based LLMs pose data security risks; 2) Local model deployment demands technical expertise; 3) General LLMs lack mechanisms to integrate medical knowledge. Retrieval-augmented systems also struggle with medical document processing and clinical usability. We developed KidneyTalk-open, a desktop system integrating three technical components: 1) No-code deployment of state-of-the-art (SOTA) open-source LLMs (such as DeepSeek-r1, Qwen2.5) via local inference engine; 2) Medical document processing pipeline combining context-aware chunking and intelligent filtering; 3) Adaptive Retrieval and Augmentation Pipeline (AddRep) employing agents collaboration for improving the recall rate of medical documents. A graphical interface was designed to enable clinicians to manage medical documents and conduct AI-powered consultations without technical expertise. Experimental validation on 1,455 challenging nephrology exam questions demonstrates AddRep's effectiveness: achieving 29.1% accuracy (+8.1% over baseline) with intelligent knowledge integration, while maintaining robustness through 4.9% rejection rate to suppress hallucinations. Comparative case studies with the mainstream products (AnythingLLM, Chatbox, GPT4ALL) demonstrate KidneyTalk-open's superior performance in real clinical query. KidneyTalk-open represents the first no-code medical LLM system enabling secure documentation-enhanced medical Q&A on desktop. Its designs establishes a new framework for privacy-sensitive clinical AI applications. The system significantly lowers technical barriers while improving evidence traceability, enabling more medical staff or patients to use SOTA open-source LLMs conveniently.</p></details> | <details><summary>Corre...</summary><p>Corresponding authors: zhanglx@bjmu.edu.cn; joy_yuxi@pku.edu.cn; hongshenda@pku.edu.cn</p></details> |
| **[Dynamic Benchmarking of Reasoning Capabilities in Code Large Language Models Under Data Contamination](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04149v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid evolution of code largelanguage models underscores the need for effective and transparent benchmarking of their reasoning capabilities. However, the current benchmarking approach heavily depends on publicly available, human-created datasets. The widespread use of these fixed benchmark datasets makes the benchmarking process to be static and thus particularly susceptible to data contamination, an unavoidable consequence of the extensive data collection processes used to train Code LLMs. Existing approaches that address data contamination often suffer from human effort limitations and imbalanced problem complexity. To tackle these challenges, we propose \tool, a novel benchmarking suite for evaluating Code LLMs under potential data contamination. Given a seed programming problem, \tool employs multiple agents to extract and modify the context without altering the core logic, generating semantically equivalent variations. We introduce a dynamic data generation methods and conduct empirical studies on two seed datasets across 21 Code LLMs. Results show that \tool effectively benchmarks reasoning capabilities under contamination risks while generating diverse problem sets to ensure consistent and reliable evaluations.</p></details> | <details><summary>https...</summary><p>https://codekaleidoscope.github.io/dycodeeval.html</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Memorization: Evaluating the True Type Inference Capabilities of LLMs for Java Code Snippets](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04076v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Type inference is a crucial task for reusing online code snippets, often found on platforms like StackOverflow, which frequently lack essential type information such as fully qualified names (FQNs) and required libraries. Recent studies have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) for type inference on code snippets, showing promising results. However, these results are potentially affected by data leakage, as the benchmark suite (StatType-SO) has been public on GitHub since 2017 (full suite in 2023). Thus, it is uncertain whether LLMs' strong performance reflects genuine code semantics understanding or a mere retrieval of ground truth from training data. To comprehensively assess LLMs' type inference capabilities on Java code snippets, we conducted a three-pronged evaluation. First, utilizing Thalia, a program synthesis technique, we created ThaliaType--a new, unseen dataset for type inference evaluation. On unseen snippets, LLM performance dropped significantly, with up to a 59% decrease in precision and 72% in recall. Second, we developed semantic-preserving transformations that significantly degraded LLMs' type inference performance, revealing weaknesses in understanding code semantics. Third, we used delta debugging to identify the minimal syntax elements sufficient for LLM inference. While type inference primarily involves inferring FQNs for types in the code snippet, LLMs correctly infer FQNs even when the types were absent from the snippets, suggesting a reliance on knowledge from training instead of thoroughly analyzing the snippets. Our findings indicate that LLMs' strong past performance likely stemmed from data leakage, rather than a genuine understanding of the semantics of code snippets. Our findings highlight the crucial need for carefully designed benchmarks using unseen code snippets to assess the true capabilities of LLMs for type inference tasks.</p></details> | under review |
| **[Code-Verification Techniques for an Arbitrary-Depth Electromagnetic Slot Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04004v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Electromagnetic penetration through openings in an otherwise closed electromagnetic scatterer is an important topic in computational electromagnetics. To efficiently model this phenomenon, aperture or slot models are often used in conjunction with surface integral equations to solve Maxwell's equations. To establish the credibility of these models, code verification is necessary to assess the correctness of the implementation of the underlying numerical methods. However, many characteristics of surface integral equations and slot models render traditional code-verification approaches ineffective. In this paper, we present approaches to separately measure the different sources of numerical error arising from the method-of-moments implementation of the electric-field integral equation with an arbitrary-depth slot model. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these approaches for several cases.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2406.14573</p></details> |

Developers increasingly use them for their work, including generating code to fulfil the data protection requirements (privacy) of the apps they build. We wanted to know if the reality is the same as expectations of AI-based programming assistants when trying to fulfil software privacy requirements, and the challenges developers face when using AI-based programming assistants and how these can be improved. To this end, we conducted a survey with 51 developers worldwide. We found that AI-based programming assistants need to be improved in order for developers to better trust them with generating code that ensures privacy. In this paper, we provide some practical recommendations for developers to consider following when using AI-based programming assistants for privacy-related code development, and some key further research directions.</p></details> |  |

Although decompilation techniques attempt to recover higher-level source code from the machine code in question, they are not fully able to restore the semantics of the original functions. Furthermore, binaries are often stripped of metadata, and this makes it challenging to reverse engineer complex binary software. In this paper we show how a combination of binary decomposition techniques, decompilation passes, and LLM-powered function summarization can be used to build an economical engine to identify modules in stripped binaries and associate them with high-level natural language descriptions. We instantiated this technique with three underlying open-source LLMs -- CodeQwen, DeepSeek-Coder and CodeStral -- and measured its effectiveness in identifying modules in robotics firmware. This experimental evaluation involved 467 modules from four devices from the ArduPilot software suite, and showed that CodeStral, the best-performing backend LLM, achieves an average F1-score of 0.68 with an online running time of just a handful of seconds.</p></details> | 11 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Construction and Decoding of Quantum Margulis Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03936v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Quantum low-density parity-check codes are a promising approach to fault-tolerant quantum computation, offering potential advantages in rate and decoding efficiency. In this work, we introduce quantum Margulis codes, a new class of QLDPC codes derived from Margulis' classical LDPC construction via the two-block group algebra framework. We show that quantum Margulis codes, unlike bivariate bicycle codes which require ordered statistics decoding for effective error correction, can be efficiently decoded using a standard min-sum decoder with linear complexity, when decoded under depolarizing noise. This is attributed to their Tanner graph structure, which does not exhibit group symmetry, thereby mitigating the well-known problem of error degeneracy in QLDPC decoding. To further enhance performance, we propose an algorithm for constructing 2BGA codes with controlled girth, ensuring a minimum girth of 6 or 8, and use it to generate several quantum Margulis codes of length 240 and 642. We validate our approach through numerical simulations, demonstrating that quantum Margulis codes behave significantly better than BB codes in the error floor region, under min-sum decoding.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 12 figures.

To this end, we adapt two state-of-the-art techniques from natural language generation -- one based on entropy and another on mutual information -- to the domain of code generation. Given the distinct semantic properties of code, we introduce modifications, including a semantic equivalence check based on symbolic execution. Our findings indicate a strong correlation between the uncertainty computed through these techniques and correctness, highlighting the potential of uncertainty estimation for quality assessment. Additionally, we propose a simplified version of the entropy-based method that assumes a uniform distribution over the LLM's responses, demonstrating comparable effectiveness. Using these techniques, we develop an abstention policy that prevents the model from making predictions when uncertainty is high, reducing incorrect outputs to near zero. Our evaluation on the LiveCodeBench shows that our approach significantly outperforms a baseline relying solely on LLM-reported log-probabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages and 3 References Pages</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Matryoshka: Revisiting Sparse Coding for Adaptive Representation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01776v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many large-scale systems rely on high-quality deep representations (embeddings) to facilitate tasks like retrieval, search, and generative modeling. Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL) recently emerged as a solution for adaptive embedding lengths, but it requires full model retraining and suffers from noticeable performance degradations at short lengths. In this paper, we show that sparse coding offers a compelling alternative for achieving adaptive representation with minimal overhead and higher fidelity. We propose Contrastive Sparse Representation (CSR), a method that sparsifies pre-trained embeddings into a high-dimensional but selectively activated feature space. By leveraging lightweight autoencoding and task-aware contrastive objectives, CSR preserves semantic quality while allowing flexible, cost-effective inference at different sparsity levels. Extensive experiments on image, text, and multimodal benchmarks demonstrate that CSR consistently outperforms MRL in terms of both accuracy and retrieval speed-often by large margins-while also cutting training time to a fraction of that required by MRL. Our results establish sparse coding as a powerful paradigm for adaptive representation learning in real-world applications where efficiency and fidelity are both paramount.

| **[Robust Learning of Diverse Code Edits](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03656v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software engineering activities frequently involve edits to existing code. However, contemporary code language models (LMs) lack the ability to handle diverse types of code-edit requirements. In this work, we attempt to overcome this shortcoming through (1) a novel synthetic data generation pipeline and (2) a robust model adaptation algorithm. Starting with seed code examples and diverse editing criteria, our pipeline generates high-quality samples comprising original and modified code, along with natural language instructions in different styles and verbosity. Today's code LMs come bundled with strong abilities, such as code generation and instruction following, which should not be lost due to fine-tuning. To ensure this, we propose a novel adaptation algorithm, SeleKT, that (a) leverages a dense gradient-based step to identify the weights that are most important for code editing, and (b) does a sparse projection onto the base model to avoid overfitting. Using our approach, we obtain a new series of models NextCoder (adapted from QwenCoder-2.5) that achieves strong results on five code-editing benchmarks, outperforming comparable size models and even several larger ones. We show the generality of our approach on two model families (DeepSeekCoder and QwenCoder), compare against other fine-tuning approaches, and demonstrate robustness by showing retention of code generation abilities post adaptation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploring Code Language Models for Automated HLS-based Hardware Generation: Benchmark, Infrastructure and Analysis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13921v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in code generation have illuminated the potential of employing large language models (LLMs) for general-purpose programming languages such as Python and C++, opening new opportunities for automating software development and enhancing programmer productivity. The potential of LLMs in software programming has sparked significant interest in exploring automated hardware generation and automation. Although preliminary endeavors have been made to adopt LLMs in generating hardware description languages (HDLs), several challenges persist in this direction. First, the volume of available HDL training data is substantially smaller compared to that for software programming languages. Second, the pre-trained LLMs, mainly tailored for software code, tend to produce HDL designs that are more error-prone. Third, the generation of HDL requires a significantly higher number of tokens compared to software programming, leading to inefficiencies in cost and energy consumption. To tackle these challenges, this paper explores leveraging LLMs to generate High-Level Synthesis (HLS)-based hardware design. Although code generation for domain-specific programming languages is not new in the literature, we aim to provide experimental results, insights, benchmarks, and evaluation infrastructure to investigate the suitability of HLS over low-level HDLs for LLM-assisted hardware design generation. To achieve this, we first finetune pre-trained models for HLS-based hardware generation, using a collected dataset with text prompts and corresponding reference HLS designs. An LLM-assisted framework is then proposed to automate end-to-end hardware code generation, which also investigates the impact of chain-of-thought and feedback loops promoting techniques on HLS-design generation. Limited by the timeframe of this research, we plan to evaluate more advanced reasoning models in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted by ASP-DAC'25</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking LLMs and LLM-based Agents in Practical Vulnerability Detection for Code Repositories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.03586v1)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in software vulnerability detection, particularly on function-level benchmarks like Devign and BigVul. However, real-world detection requires interprocedural analysis, as vulnerabilities often emerge through multi-hop function calls rather than isolated functions. While repository-level benchmarks like ReposVul and VulEval introduce interprocedural context, they remain computationally expensive, lack pairwise evaluation of vulnerability fixes, and explore limited context retrieval, limiting their practicality. We introduce JitVul, a JIT vulnerability detection benchmark linking each function to its vulnerability-introducing and fixing commits. Built from 879 CVEs spanning 91 vulnerability types, JitVul enables comprehensive evaluation of detection capabilities. Our results show that ReAct Agents, leveraging thought-action-observation and interprocedural context, perform better than LLMs in distinguishing vulnerable from benign code. While prompting strategies like Chain-of-Thought help LLMs, ReAct Agents require further refinement. Both methods show inconsistencies, either misidentifying vulnerabilities or over-analyzing security guards, indicating significant room for improvement.</p></details> |  |

We establish the connectivity of $ G(\mathbb{Z}_n) $, show that its diameter is at most three, and analyze its edge connectivity. Furthermore, we construct $ q $-ary linear codes from the incidence matrix of $ G(\mathbb{Z}_n) $, explicitly determining their parameters and duals. A primary contribution of this work is the resolution of two conjectures from \cite{Jain2023} concerning the structural and coding-theoretic properties of $ G(\mathbb{Z}_n) $. These results extend the study of algebraic graph structures and highlight the interplay between number theory, graph theory, and coding theory.</p></details> |  |

Code generation not only facilitates faster prototyping and automated testing, but also augments developer efficiency through improved maintainability and reusability of code. In this paper, we introduce CodeIF, the first benchmark specifically designed to assess the abilities of LLMs to adhere to task-oriented instructions within diverse code generation scenarios. CodeIF encompasses a broad range of tasks, including function synthesis, error debugging, algorithmic refactoring, and code explanation, thereby providing a comprehensive suite to evaluate model performance across varying complexity levels and programming domains. We conduct extensive experiments with LLMs, analyzing their strengths and limitations in meeting the demands of these tasks. The experimental results offer valuable insights into how well current models align with human instructions, as well as the extent to which they can generate consistent, maintainable, and contextually relevant code. Our findings not only underscore the critical role that instruction-following LLMs can play in modern software development, but also illuminate pathways for future research aimed at enhancing their adaptability, reliability, and overall effectiveness in automated code generation.</p></details> |  |

The analysis is comprehensive for that we consider M-to-N broadcast instead of 1-to-N, which allows both different messages and same messages to be transmitted by several sources at the same time. Although the routes between source-destination pairs are subject to change when some nodes have large backlogs, we derive fixed equivalent routes to provide a upper bound of delay. For some special cases, an detour method is also provided to increase the estimation accuracy. Different network topologies are tested in numeric simulation. The results demonstrate the accuracy of our delay performance approximation.</p></details> |  |

We define quasi-$s$-dimensional polycyclic codes and establish an $R$-isomorphism between these codes and polycyclic codes over $\mathscr R$. We provide necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of annihilator self-dual, annihilator self-orthogonal, annihilator linear complementary dual, and annihilator dual-containing polycyclic codes over this class of rings. We also establish the CSS construction for annihilator dual-preserving polycyclic codes over the chain ring $R$ and use this construction to derive quantum codes from polycyclic codes over $\mathscr{R}$.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, version accepted for publication in Cryptography and Communications</p></details> |

Verilog is a popular hardware description language for designing and modeling digital systems; thus, Verilog generation is one of the emerging areas of research to facilitate the design process. In this work, we propose VerilogCoder, a system of multiple Artificial Intelligence (AI) agents for Verilog code generation, to autonomously write Verilog code and fix syntax and functional errors using collaborative Verilog tools (i.e., syntax checker, simulator, and waveform tracer). Firstly, we propose a task planner that utilizes a novel Task and Circuit Relation Graph retrieval method to construct a holistic plan based on module descriptions. To debug and fix functional errors, we develop a novel and efficient abstract syntax tree (AST)-based waveform tracing tool, which is integrated within the autonomous Verilog completion flow. The proposed methodology successfully generates 94.2% syntactically and functionally correct Verilog code, surpassing the state-of-the-art methods by 33.9% on the VerilogEval-Human v2 benchmark.</p></details> | <details><summary>main ...</summary><p>main paper 7 pages, reference 1 page, it is the version that accepted by AAAI 2025</p></details> |

However, existing methods for code embedding, including those based on LLMs, often depend on costly supervised training or fine-tuning for domain adaptation. This paper proposes a novel zero-shot approach, zsLLMCode, to generate code embeddings by using LLMs and sentence embedding models. This approach attempts to eliminate the need for task-specific training or fine-tuning, and to effectively address the issue of erroneous information commonly found in LLM-generated outputs. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate the performance of the proposed approach by considering various LLMs and embedding models. The results have demonstrated the effectiveness and superiority of our method zsLLMCode over state-of-the-art unsupervised approaches such as SourcererCC, Code2vec, InferCode, and TransformCode. Our findings highlight the potential of zsLLMCode to advance the field of SE by providing robust and efficient solutions for code embedding tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Error Correction Code Transformer: From Non-Unified to Unified](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03364v2)** | 2025-03-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Channel coding is vital for reliable data transmission in modern wireless systems, and its significance will increase with the emergence of sixth-generation (6G) networks, which will need to support various error correction codes. However, traditional decoders were typically designed as fixed hardware circuits tailored to specific decoding algorithms, leading to inefficiencies and limited flexibility. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a unified, code-agnostic Transformer-based decoding architecture capable of handling multiple linear block codes, including Polar, Low-Density Parity-Check (LDPC), and Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem (BCH), within a single framework. To achieve this, standardized units are employed to harmonize parameters across different code types, while the redesigned unified attention module compresses the structural information of various codewords. Additionally, a sparse mask, derived from the sparsity of the parity-check matrix, is introduced to enhance the model's ability to capture inherent constraints between information and parity-check bits, resulting in improved decoding accuracy and robustness. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that the proposed unified Transformer-based decoder not only outperforms existing methods but also provides a flexible, efficient, and high-performance solution for next-generation wireless communication systems.</p></details> |  |

We associate a latroid to a code over a ring or a field endowed with a general support function, and show that the generalized weights of the code can be recovered from the associated latroid. This provides a uniform framework for studying generalized weights of linear block codes, linear codes over a ring, rank-metric and sum-rank metric codes. Under suitable assumptions, we show that the latroid determines the weight distribution of the code.</p></details> |  |
| **[KodCode: A Diverse, Challenging, and Verifiable Synthetic Dataset for Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02951v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce KodCode, a synthetic dataset that addresses the persistent challenge of acquiring high-quality, verifiable training data across diverse difficulties and domains for training Large Language Models for coding. Existing code-focused resources typically fail to ensure either the breadth of coverage (e.g., spanning simple coding tasks to advanced algorithmic problems) or verifiable correctness (e.g., unit tests). In contrast, KodCode comprises question-solution-test triplets that are systematically validated via a self-verification procedure. Our pipeline begins by synthesizing a broad range of coding questions, then generates solutions and test cases with additional attempts allocated to challenging problems. Finally, post-training data synthesis is done by rewriting questions into diverse formats and generating responses under a test-based reject sampling procedure from a reasoning model (DeepSeek R1). This pipeline yields a large-scale, robust and diverse coding dataset. KodCode is suitable for supervised fine-tuning and the paired unit tests also provide great potential for RL tuning. Fine-tuning experiments on coding benchmarks (HumanEval(+), MBPP(+), BigCodeBench, and LiveCodeBench) demonstrate that KodCode-tuned models achieve state-of-the-art performance, surpassing models like Qwen2.5-Coder-32B-Instruct and DeepSeek-R1-Distill-Llama-70B.</p></details> | <details><summary>Codes...</summary><p>Codes and Data: https://kodcode-ai.github.io/</p></details> |

We describe the use of the watsonx Code Assistant (WCA), an LLM-powered coding assistant deployed internally within IBM. Through surveys of two user cohorts (N=669) and unmoderated usability testing (N=15), we examined developers' experiences with WCA and its impact on their productivity. We learned about their motivations for using (or not using) WCA, we examined their expectations of its speed and quality, and we identified new considerations regarding ownership of and responsibility for generated code. Our case study characterizes the impact of an LLM-powered assistant on developers' perceptions of productivity and it shows that although such tools do often provide net productivity increases, these benefits may not always be experienced by all users.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 3 figures.

| **[The Shift from Writing to Pruning Software: A Bonsai-Inspired IDE for Reshaping AI Generated Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02833v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of AI-driven coding assistants signals a fundamental shift in how software is built. While AI coding assistants have been integrated into existing Integrated Development Environments (IDEs), their full potential remains largely untapped. A key challenge is that these AI assistants can suffer from hallucinations, leading developers down decision paths that the AI should not dictate, sometimes even without the users awareness or consent. Moreover, current static-file IDEs lack the mechanisms to address critical issues such as tracking the provenance of AI-generated code and integrating version control in a way that aligns with the dynamic nature of AI-assisted development. As a result, developers are left without the necessary tools to manage, refine, and validate AI generated code systematically, making it difficult to ensure correctness, maintainability, and trust in the development process. Existing IDEs treat AI-generated code as static text, offering limited support for managing its evolution, refinement, or multiple alternative paths. Drawing inspiration from the ancient art of Japanese Bonsai gardening focused on balance, structure, and deliberate pruning: we propose a new approach to IDEs, where AI is allowed to generate in its true, unconstrained form, free from traditional file structures. This approach fosters a more fluid and interactive method for code evolution. We introduce the concept of a Bonsai-inspired IDE, structured as a graph of generated code snippets and multiple code paths, enabling developers to reshape AI generated code to suit their needs. Our vision calls for a shift away from a static file based model toward a dynamic, evolving system that allows for continuous refinement of generated code, with the IDE evolving alongside AI powered modifications rather than merely serving as a place to write and edit code.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to SE 2030 Software Engineering Roadmap Workshop</p></details> |

Existing methods construct preference pairs from candidates based on test case success, treating the higher pass rate sample as positive and the lower as negative. However, this approach does not pinpoint specific errors in the code, which prevents the model from learning more informative error correction patterns, as aligning failing code as a whole lacks the granularity needed to capture meaningful error-resolution relationships. To address these issues, we propose IterPref, a new preference alignment framework that mimics human iterative debugging to refine Code LLMs. IterPref explicitly locates error regions and aligns the corresponding tokens via a tailored DPO algorithm. To generate informative pairs, we introduce the CodeFlow dataset, where samples are iteratively refined until passing tests, with modifications capturing error corrections. Extensive experiments show that a diverse suite of Code LLMs equipped with IterPref achieves significant performance gains in code generation and improves on challenging tasks like BigCodeBench. In-depth analysis reveals that IterPref yields fewer errors. Our code and data will be made publicaly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>The c...</summary><p>The code and data will be released soon</p></details> |

We address the problem by developing two new finite blocklength achievability bounds, which we use to benchmark the performance of two coding schemes based on polar codes with outer cyclic redundancy check (CRC) codes -- also referred to as CRC-aided (CA) polar codes. The first bound is obtained by considering an outer detection code, whereas the second bound relies on a threshold test applied to the generalized information density. Similarly, in the first CA polar code scheme, we reserve a fraction of the outer CRC parity bits for error detection, whereas in the second scheme, we apply a threshold test (specifically, Forney's optimal rule) to the output of the successive cancellation list decoder. Numerical simulations performed on the binary-input AWGN channel reveal that, in the short-blocklength regime, the threshold-based approach is superior to the CRC-based approach, both in terms of bounds and performance of CA polar code schemes. We also consider the case of decoding with noisy channel-state information, which leads to a mismatched decoding setting. Our results illustrate that, differently from the previous case, in this scenario, the CRC-based approach outperforms the threshold-based approach, which is more sensitive to the mismatch.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures, accepted for publication in IEEE Trans.

However, existing tools do not sufficiently link the data contexts such as schemas and values with the code being edited. This not only leads to poor code suggestions, but also frequent interruptions in coding processes as users need additional code to locate and understand relevant data. We introduce Xavier, a tool designed to enhance data wrangling script authoring in computational notebooks. Xavier maintains users' awareness of data contexts while providing data-aware code suggestions. It automatically highlights the most relevant data based on the user's code, integrates both code and data contexts for more accurate suggestions, and instantly previews data transformation results for easy verification. To evaluate the effectiveness and usability of Xavier, we conducted a user study with 16 data analysts, showing its potential to streamline data wrangling scripts authoring.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI'25), April 26-May 1, 2025, Yokohama, Japan</p></details> |
| **[Let the Code LLM Edit Itself When You Edit the Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.03157v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we investigate a typical scenario in code generation where a developer edits existing code in real time and requests a code assistant, e.g., a large language model, to re-predict the next token or next line on the fly. Naively, the LLM needs to re-encode the entire KV cache to provide an accurate prediction. However, this process is computationally expensive, especially when the sequence length is long. Simply encoding the edited subsequence and integrating it to the original KV cache meets the temporal confusion problem, leading to significantly worse performance. We address this efficiency and accuracy trade-off by introducing \underline{\textbf{Positional \textbf{I}ntegrity \textbf{E}ncoding} (PIE). Building upon the rotary positional encoding, PIE first removes the rotary matrices in the Key cache that introduce temporal confusion and then reapplies the correct rotary matrices. This process ensures that positional relationships between tokens are correct and requires only a single round of matrix multiplication. We validate the effectiveness of PIE through extensive experiments on the RepoBench-C-8k dataset, utilizing DeepSeek-Coder models with 1.3B, 6.7B, and 33B parameters. Our evaluation includes three real-world coding tasks: code insertion, code deletion, and multi-place code editing. Results demonstrate that PIE reduces computational overhead by over 85% compared to the standard full recomputation approach across all model sizes and tasks while well approximating the model performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Camera Ready</p></details> |

However, most code samples in these benchmarks are short, standalone, statement/method-level, and algorithmic, which is not aligned with practical coding tasks. Therefore, it is still unknown the actual capability of LLMs in translating code samples written for daily development. To achieve this, we construct a class-level code translation benchmark, ClassEval-T, and make the first attempt to extensively assess recent LLMs' performance on class-level code translation. ClassEval-T is extended from ClassEval, a well-known class-level Python code generation benchmark consisting of multiple practical coding topics, such as database operation and game design, and diverse contextual dependencies (e.g., fields, methods, and libraries). It cost us 360 person-hours to accomplish the manual migration to Java and C++ with complete code samples and associated test suites. Subsequently, we design three translation strategies (i.e., holistic, min-dependency, and standalone) for class-level code translations and evaluate eight recent LLMs of commercial, general, and code kinds in diverse families and sizes on ClassEval-T. Experimental results demonstrate a remarkable performance drop compared with the most widely studied method-level code translation benchmark, and obvious discrepancies among LLMs appear, showing the effectiveness of ClassEval-T in measuring recent LLMs. Afterwards, we further discuss the usage scenarios for diverse translation strategies and LLMs' ability to dependency awareness when translating class samples. Finally, 1,243 failure cases made by the best-performing LLM under test are analyzed and categorized in this paper for practical guidance and future enlightenment.</p></details> |  |

To address this gap, we introduce a novel, high-quality dataset comprising 3,347 PennyLane-specific code samples of quantum circuits and their contextual descriptions, specifically curated to train/fine-tune LLM-based quantum code assistance.

Finally, the paper discusses the challenges faced in evaluating LLMs in code generation, particularly how to ensure the comprehensiveness and accuracy of evaluation methods and how to adapt to the evolving practices of software development. These analyses and discussions provide valuable insights for further optimizing and improving the application of LLMs in code generation tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Memorize or Generalize? Evaluating LLM Code Generation with Evolved Questions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02296v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are known to exhibit a memorization phenomenon in code generation: instead of truly understanding the underlying principles of a programming problem, they tend to memorize the original prompt and its solution together in the training. Consequently, when facing variants of the original problem, their answers very likely resemble the memorized solutions and fail to generalize. In this paper, we investigate this phenomenon by designing three evolution strategies to create variants: mutation, paraphrasing, and code-rewriting. By comparing the performance and AST similarity of the LLM-generated codes before and after these three evolutions, we develop a memorization score that positively correlates with the level of memorization. As expected, as supervised fine-tuning goes on, the memorization score rises before overfitting, suggesting more severe memorization. We demonstrate that common mitigation approaches, such as prompt translation and using evolved variants as data augmentation in supervised learning and reinforcement learning, either compromise the performance or fail to alleviate the memorization issue. Therefore, memorization remains a significant challenge in LLM code generation, highlighting the need for a more effective solution.</p></details> |  |
| **[TPIA: Towards Target-specific Prompt Injection Attack against Code-oriented Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.09164v5)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, code-oriented large language models (Code LLMs) have been widely and successfully exploited to simplify and facilitate programming. Unfortunately, a few pioneering works revealed that these Code LLMs are vulnerable to backdoor and adversarial attacks. The former poisons the training data or model parameters, hijacking the LLMs to generate malicious code snippets when encountering the trigger. The latter crafts malicious adversarial input codes to reduce the quality of the generated codes. In this paper, we reveal that both attacks have some inherent limitations: backdoor attacks rely on the adversary's capability of controlling the model training process, which may not be practical; adversarial attacks struggle with fulfilling specific malicious purposes. To alleviate these problems, this paper presents a novel attack paradigm against Code LLMs, namely target-specific prompt injection attack (TPIA). TPIA generates non-functional perturbations containing the information of malicious instructions and inserts them into the victim's code context by spreading them into potentially used dependencies (e.g., packages or RAG's knowledge base). It induces the Code LLMs to generate attacker-specified malicious code snippets at the target location. In general, we compress the attacker-specified malicious objective into the perturbation by adversarial optimization based on greedy token search. We collect 13 representative malicious objectives to design 31 threat cases for three popular programming languages. We show that our TPIA can successfully attack three representative open-source Code LLMs (with an attack success rate of up to 97.9%) and two mainstream commercial Code LLM-integrated applications (with an attack success rate of over 90%) in all threat cases, using only a 12-token non-functional perturbation.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Code to Courtroom: LLMs as the New Software Judges](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02246v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to automate SE tasks such as code generation and summarization. However, evaluating the quality of LLM-generated software artifacts remains challenging. Human evaluation, while effective, is very costly and time-consuming. Traditional automated metrics like BLEU rely on high-quality references and struggle to capture nuanced aspects of software quality, such as readability and usefulness. In response, the LLM-as-a-Judge paradigm, which employs LLMs for automated evaluation, has emerged. Given that LLMs are typically trained to align with human judgment and possess strong coding abilities and reasoning skills, they hold promise as cost-effective and scalable surrogates for human evaluators. Nevertheless, LLM-as-a-Judge research in the SE community is still in its early stages, with many breakthroughs needed. This forward-looking SE 2030 paper aims to steer the research community toward advancing LLM-as-a-Judge for evaluating LLMgenerated software artifacts, while also sharing potential research paths to achieve this goal. We provide a literature review of existing SE studies on LLM-as-a-Judge and envision these frameworks as reliable, robust, and scalable human surrogates capable of evaluating software artifacts with consistent, multi-faceted assessments by 2030 and beyond. To validate this vision, we analyze the limitations of current studies, identify key research gaps, and outline a detailed roadmap to guide future developments of LLM-as-a-Judge in software engineering. While not intended to be a definitive guide, our work aims to foster further research and adoption of LLM-as-a-Judge frameworks within the SE community, ultimately improving the effectiveness and scalability of software artifact evaluation methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoRNStack: High-Quality Contrastive Data for Better Code Retrieval and Reranking](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.01007v3)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective code retrieval plays a crucial role in advancing code generation, bug fixing, and software maintenance, particularly as software systems increase in complexity. While current code embedding models have demonstrated promise in retrieving code snippets for small-scale, well-defined tasks, they often underperform in more demanding real-world applications such as bug localization within GitHub repositories. We hypothesize that a key issue is their reliance on noisy and inconsistent datasets for training, which impedes their ability to generalize to more complex retrieval scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce CoRNStack, a large-scale, high-quality contrastive training dataset for code that spans multiple programming languages. This dataset is curated using consistency filtering to eliminate noisy positives and is further enriched with mined hard negatives, thereby facilitating more effective learning. We demonstrate that contrastive training of embedding models using CoRNStack leads to state-of-the-art performance across a variety of code retrieval tasks. Furthermore, the dataset can be leveraged for training code reranking models, a largely underexplored area compared to text reranking. Our finetuned code reranking model significantly improves the ranking quality over the retrieved results. Finally, by employing our code retriever and reranker together, we demonstrate significant improvements in function localization for GitHub issues, an important component of real-world software development.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025.

As a result, a growing need for efficient compression methods optimized for machine vision, rather than human vision, has emerged. To meet this growing demand, several methods have been developed for image and video coding for machines. Unfortunately, while there is a substantial body of knowledge regarding rate-distortion theory for human vision, the same cannot be said of machine analysis. In this paper, we extend the current rate-distortion theory for machines, providing insight into important design considerations of machine-vision codecs. We then utilize this newfound understanding to improve several methods for learnable image coding for machines. Our proposed methods achieve state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on several computer vision tasks such as classification, instance segmentation, and object detection.</p></details> |  |

In this article, we propose a methodology for enabling mixed-precision with the help of computer arithmetic tools, roofline model, and computer arithmetic techniques. As case studies, we consider Nekbone, a mini-application for the Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) solver Nek5000, and a modern Neko CFD application. With the help of the VerifiCarlo tool and computer arithmetic techniques, we introduce a strategy to address stagnation issues in the preconditioned Conjugate Gradient method in Nekbone and apply these insights to implement a mixed-precision version of Neko. We evaluate the derived mixed-precision versions of these codes by combining metrics in three dimensions: accuracy, time-to-solution, and energy-to-solution. Notably, mixed-precision in Nekbone reduces time-to-solution by roughly 38% and energy-to-solution by 2.8x on MareNostrum 5, while in the real-world Neko application the gain is up to 29% in time and up to 24% in energy, without sacrificing the accuracy.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2405.11065</p></details> |

Driven by interest in understanding how benign or catastrophic under-regularization and overfitting might be, we obtain a precise quantitative description of the worst case limiting error as a function of the regularization parameter $\lambda$ and noise level (or approximation error), significantly tightening the analysis of \citeauthor{GL} for $\lambda=1$ and extending it to all other choices of $\lambda$.</p></details> |  |
| **[CoCoNUT: Structural Code Understanding does not fall out of a tree](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.16456v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown impressive performance across a wide array of tasks involving both structured and unstructured textual data. Recent results on various benchmarks for code generation, repair, or completion suggest that certain models have programming abilities comparable to or even surpass humans. In this work, we demonstrate that high performance on such benchmarks does not correlate to humans' innate ability to understand structural control flow in code. To this end, we extract solutions from the HumanEval benchmark, which the relevant models perform strongly on, and trace their execution path using function calls sampled from the respective test set. Using this dataset, we investigate the ability of seven state-of-the-art LLMs to match the execution trace and find that, despite their ability to generate semantically identical code, they possess limited ability to trace execution paths, especially for longer traces and specific control structures. We find that even the top-performing model, Gemini, can fully and correctly generate only 47% of HumanEval task traces. Additionally, we introduce a subset for three key structures not contained in HumanEval: Recursion, Parallel Processing, and Object-Oriented Programming, including concepts like Inheritance and Polymorphism. Besides OOP, we show that none of the investigated models achieve an accuracy over 5% on the relevant traces. Aggregating these specialized parts with HumanEval tasks, we present CoCoNUT: Code Control Flow for Navigation Understanding and Testing, which measures a model's ability to trace execution of code upon relevant calls, including advanced structural components. We conclude that current LLMs need significant improvement to enhance code reasoning abilities. We hope our dataset helps researchers bridge this gap.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at 2025 IEEE/ACM International Workshop on Large Language Models for Code (LLM4Code)</p></details> |
| **[Which Code Statements Implement Privacy Behaviors in Android Applications?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02091v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A "privacy behavior" in software is an action where the software uses personal information for a service or a feature, such as a website using location to provide content relevant to a user. Programmers are required by regulations or application stores to provide privacy notices and labels describing these privacy behaviors. Although many tools and research prototypes have been developed to help programmers generate these notices by analyzing the source code, these approaches are often fairly coarse-grained (i.e., at the level of whole methods or files, rather than at the statement level). But this is not necessarily how privacy behaviors exist in code. Privacy behaviors are embedded in specific statements in code. Current literature does not examine what statements programmers see as most important, how consistent these views are, or how to detect them. In this paper, we conduct an empirical study to examine which statements programmers view as most-related to privacy behaviors. We find that expression statements that make function calls are most associated with privacy behaviors, while the type of privacy label has little effect on the attributes of the selected statements. We then propose an approach to automatically detect these privacy-relevant statements by fine-tuning three large language models with the data from the study. We observe that the agreement between our approach and participants is comparable to or higher than an agreement between two participants. Our study and detection approach can help programmers understand which statements in code affect privacy in mobile applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 8 figures, under review</p></details> |

We propose a new connection between parallel and sequential recovery, which leads to a general construction of q-ary linear codes with information $(r, t_i, \delta)$-sequential-locality where each of the $i$-th information symbols is contained in $t_i$ punctured subcodes with length $(r+\delta-1)$ and minimum distance $\delta$. We prove that such codes are $(r, t)_q$-SLRC ($t \geq \delta t_i+1$), which implies that they permit sequential recovery for up to $t$ erasures each one by $r$ other code symbols.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, one table and one figure</p></details> |

Although their belief propagation (BP) performance is proved to approach capacity in the asymptotic regime, there is no evidence indicating that their BP performance is equally good in the finite-length regime. In this paper, we propose a protograph-based construction for BNCs, referred to as protograph-based BNCs (P-BNCs), which significantly differs from existing BNCs in three aspects: 1) The vast majority of existing construction methods mainly focus on the degree distribution of check nodes (CNs), whereas P-BNCs not only specify the degree distributions of CNs and variable nodes (VNs) but also partially constrain the connectivity between CNs and VNs. 2) Traditional BNCs use a fixed degree distribution to generate all batches, making their performance highly sensitive to channel conditions, but P-BNCs achieve good performance under varying channel conditions due to their rate-compatible structures. 3) The construction of PBNCs takes into account joint BP decoding with a sparse precode, whereas traditional constructions typically do not consider a precode, or assume the presence of a precode that can recover a certain fraction of erasures. Thanks to these three improvements, P-BNCs not only have higher achievable rates under varying channel conditions, but more importantly, their BP performance is significantly improved at practical lengths.</p></details> | <details><summary>submi...</summary><p>submitted to IEEE for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[From superposition to sparse codes: interpretable representations in neural networks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01824v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Understanding how information is represented in neural networks is a fundamental challenge in both neuroscience and artificial intelligence. Despite their nonlinear architectures, recent evidence suggests that neural networks encode features in superposition, meaning that input concepts are linearly overlaid within the network's representations. We present a perspective that explains this phenomenon and provides a foundation for extracting interpretable representations from neural activations. Our theoretical framework consists of three steps: (1) Identifiability theory shows that neural networks trained for classification recover latent features up to a linear transformation. (2) Sparse coding methods can extract disentangled features from these representations by leveraging principles from compressed sensing. (3) Quantitative interpretability metrics provide a means to assess the success of these methods, ensuring that extracted features align with human-interpretable concepts. By bridging insights from theoretical neuroscience, representation learning, and interpretability research, we propose an emerging perspective on understanding neural representations in both artificial and biological systems. Our arguments have implications for neural coding theories, AI transparency, and the broader goal of making deep learning models more interpretable.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automorphism Ensemble Decoding of Quantum LDPC Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01738v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce AutDEC, a fast and accurate decoder for quantum error-correcting codes with large automorphism groups. Our decoder employs a set of automorphisms of the quantum code and an ensemble of belief propagation (BP) decoders. Each BP decoder is given a syndrome which is transformed by one of the automorphisms, and is run in parallel. For quantum codes, the accuracy of BP decoders is limited because short cycles occur in the Tanner graph and our approach mitigates this effect. We demonstrate decoding accuracy comparable to BP-OSD-0 with a lower time overhead for Quantum Reed-Muller (QRM) codes in the code capacity setting, and Bivariate Bicycle (BB) codes under circuit level noise. We provide a Python repository for use by the community and the results of our simulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/hsayginel/autdec</p></details> |

Current LLM approaches generate text- or code-based reasoning chains with sub-goals and action plans. However, they do not fully leverage LLMs' symbolic computing and code generation capabilities. Many robot TAMP tasks involve complex optimization under multiple constraints, where pure textual reasoning is insufficient. While augmenting LLMs with predefined solvers and planners improves performance, it lacks generalization across tasks. Given LLMs' growing coding proficiency, we enhance their TAMP capabilities by steering them to generate code as symbolic planners for optimization and constraint verification. Unlike prior work that uses code to interface with robot action modules, we steer LLMs to generate code as solvers, planners, and checkers for TAMP tasks requiring symbolic computing, while still leveraging textual reasoning to incorporate common sense. With a multi-round guidance and answer evolution framework, the proposed Code-as-Symbolic-Planner improves success rates by average 24.1\% over best baseline methods across seven typical TAMP tasks and three popular LLMs. Code-as-Symbolic-Planner shows strong effectiveness and generalizability across discrete and continuous environments, 2D/3D simulations and real-world settings, as well as single- and multi-robot tasks with diverse requirements.

| **[An Analytical Study of the Min-Sum Approximation for Polar Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13092v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The min-sum approximation is widely used in the decoding of polar codes. Although it is a numerical approximation, hardly any penalties are incurred in practice. We give a theoretical justification for this. We consider the common case of a binary-input, memoryless, and symmetric channel, decoded using successive cancellation and the min-sum approximation. Under mild assumptions, we show the following. For the finite length case, we show how to exactly calculate the error probabilities of all synthetic (bit) channels in time $O(N^{1.585})$, where $N$ is the codeword length. This implies a code construction algorithm with the above complexity. For the asymptotic case, we develop two rate thresholds, denoted $R_{\mathrm{L}} = R_{\mathrm{L}}(\lambda)$ and $R_{\mathrm{U}} =R_{\mathrm{U}}(\lambda)$, where $\lambda(\cdot)$ is the labeler of the channel outputs (essentially, a quantizer). For any $0 < \beta < \frac{1}{2}$ and any code rate $R < R_{\mathrm{L}}$, there exists a family of polar codes with growing lengths such that their rates are at least $R$ and their error probabilities are at most $2^{-N^\beta}$. That is, strong polarization continues to hold under the min-sum approximation. Conversely, for code rates exceeding $R_{\mathrm{U}}$, the error probability approaches $1$ as the code-length increases, irrespective of which bits are frozen. We show that $0 < R_{\mathrm{L}} \leq R_{\mathrm{U}} \leq C$, where $C$ is the channel capacity. The last inequality is often strict, in which case the ramification of using the min-sum approximation is that we can no longer achieve capacity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Test Script Intention Generation for Mobile Application via GUI Image and Code Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.05165v3)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Testing is the most direct and effective technique to ensure software quality. Test scripts always play a more important role in mobile app testing than test cases for source code, due to the GUI-intensive and event-driven characteristics of mobile applications (app). Test scripts focus on user interactions and the corresponding response events, which is significant for testing the target app functionalities. Therefore, it is critical to understand the test scripts for better script maintenance and modification. There exist some mature code understanding (i.e., code comment generation) technologies that can be directly applied to functionality source code with business logic. However, such technologies will have difficulties when being applied to test scripts, because test scripts are loosely linked to apps under test (AUT) by widget selectors, and do not contain business logic themselves. In order to solve the test script understanding gap, this paper presents a novel approach, namely TestIntention, to infer the intention of GUI test scripts. Test intention refers to the user expectations of app behaviors for specific operations. TestIntention formalizes test scripts with an operation sequence model. For each operation within the sequence, TestIntention extracts the target widget selector and links the selector to the GUI layout information or the corresponding response events. For widgets identified by XPath, TestIntention utilizes the image understanding technologies to explore the detailed information of the widget images, the intention of which is understood with a deep learning model. For widgets identified by ID, TestIntention first maps the selectors to the response methods with business logic, and then adopts code understanding technologies to describe code in natural language form. Results of all operations are combined to generate test intention for test scripts.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ACM Transactions on Software Engineering and Methodology (TOSEM) in March 2025</p></details> |

These advancements have prompted numerous efforts to quantitatively evaluate their coding capabilities. However, persistent challenges, such as benchmark leakage, data dissipation, and limited system accessibility, continue to impede a timely and accurate assessment. To address these limitations, we introduce CodeArena, an online evaluation framework tailored for LLM code generation. The key innovation is a collective evaluation mechanism, which dynamically recalibrates individual model scores based on the holistic performance of all participating models, mitigating score biases caused by widespread benchmark leakage. In addition, CodeArena ensures open access to all submitted solutions and test cases and provides automation-friendly APIs to streamline the code evaluation workflow. Our main contributions are: (1) a collective evaluation system for unbiased assessment, (2) a public repository of solutions and test cases, and (3) automation-ready APIs for seamless integration.</p></details> |  |

We investigate a novel application: using LLMs as surrogate models for code execution prediction. Given LLMs' unique ability to understand and process diverse programs, they present a promising direction for building general-purpose surrogate models. To systematically investigate this capability, we introduce SURGE, a comprehensive benchmark with $1160$ problems covering $8$ key aspects: multi-language programming tasks, competition-level programming problems, repository-level code analysis, high-cost scientific computing, time-complexity-intensive algorithms, buggy code analysis, programs dependent on specific compilers or execution environments, and formal mathematical proof verification. Through extensive empirical analysis of $21$ open-source and proprietary LLMs, we examine scaling laws, data efficiency, and predictive accuracy. Our findings reveal important insights about the feasibility of LLMs as efficient surrogates for computational processes, with implications for automated software testing, program analysis, and computational resource optimization in data mining applications.

However, the mechanisms underlying the development of these capabilities during pre-training are not well understood. In this paper, we use code LLMs as an experimental platform to explore the evolution of multilingual capabilities in LLMs during the pre-training process. Based on our observations, we propose the Babel Tower Hypothesis, which describes the entire process of LLMs acquiring new language capabilities. During the learning process, multiple languages initially share a single knowledge system dominated by the primary language and gradually develop language-specific knowledge systems. We then validate the above hypothesis by tracking the internal states of the LLMs through identifying working languages and language transferring neurons. Experimental results show that the internal state changes of the LLM are consistent with our Babel Tower Hypothesis. Building on these insights, we propose a novel method to construct an optimized pre-training corpus for multilingual code LLMs, which significantly outperforms LLMs trained on the original corpus. The proposed Babel Tower Hypothesis provides new insights into designing pre-training data distributions to achieve optimal multilingual capabilities in LLMs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Despite progress in code completion models, benchmarks for Solidity, the primary smart contract language, are lacking. Existing metrics like BLEU do not adequately assess the functional correctness of generated smart contracts. To fill this gap, we introduce SolBench, a benchmark for evaluating the functional correctness of Solidity smart contracts generated by code completion models. SolBench includes 4,178 functions from 1,155 Ethereum-deployed contracts. Testing advanced models revealed challenges in generating correct code without context, as Solidity functions rely on context-defined variables and interfaces. To address this, we propose a Retrieval-Augmented Code Repair framework. In this framework, an executor verifies functional correctness, and if necessary, an LLM repairs the code using retrieved snippets informed by executor traces. We conduct a comprehensive evaluation of both closed-source and open-source LLMs across various model sizes and series to assess their performance in smart contract completion. The results show that code repair and retrieval techniques effectively enhance the correctness of smart contract completion while reducing computational costs.</p></details> |  |

This study takes the term "accelerated degradation" combined with "reliability" as an example, and finds that, for papers published by Elsevier, only GitHub links included in abstracts are comprehensively retrieved by Google Scholar. When such links appear within the main body of a paper, even in the "Data Availability" section, they may be ignored and become unsearchable. These findings highlight the importance of strategically placing GitHub links in abstracts to enhance code discoverability on Google Scholar.</p></details> |  |

A Comprehensive Analysis of Package Hallucinations by Code Generating LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10279v3)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The reliance of popular programming languages such as Python and JavaScript on centralized package repositories and open-source software, combined with the emergence of code-generating Large Language Models (LLMs), has created a new type of threat to the software supply chain: package hallucinations. These hallucinations, which arise from fact-conflicting errors when generating code using LLMs, represent a novel form of package confusion attack that poses a critical threat to the integrity of the software supply chain. This paper conducts a rigorous and comprehensive evaluation of package hallucinations across different programming languages, settings, and parameters, exploring how a diverse set of models and configurations affect the likelihood of generating erroneous package recommendations and identifying the root causes of this phenomenon. Using 16 popular LLMs for code generation and two unique prompt datasets, we generate 576,000 code samples in two programming languages that we analyze for package hallucinations. Our findings reveal that that the average percentage of hallucinated packages is at least 5.2% for commercial models and 21.7% for open-source models, including a staggering 205,474 unique examples of hallucinated package names, further underscoring the severity and pervasiveness of this threat. To overcome this problem, we implement several hallucination mitigation strategies and show that they are able to significantly reduce the number of package hallucinations while maintaining code quality. Our experiments and findings highlight package hallucinations as a persistent and systemic phenomenon while using state-of-the-art LLMs for code generation, and a significant challenge which deserves the research community's urgent attention.</p></details> | <details><summary>To ap...</summary><p>To appear in the 2025 USENIX Security Symposium. 22 pages, 14 figures, 8 tables.

Still, developers often struggle to incorporate these properties into software projects as they either lack proper cybersecurity training or do not consider them a priority. Prior work has tried to support privacy and security engineering activities through threat modeling methods for scrutinizing flaws in system architectures. Moreover, several techniques for the automatic identification of vulnerabilities and the generation of secure code implementations have also been proposed in the current literature. Conversely, such as-code approaches seem under-investigated in the privacy domain, with little work elaborating on (i) the automatic detection of privacy properties in source code or (ii) the generation of privacy-friendly code. In this work, we seek to characterize the current research landscape of Privacy as Code (PaC) methods and tools by conducting a rapid literature review. Our results suggest that PaC research is in its infancy, especially regarding the performance evaluation and usability assessment of the existing approaches. Based on these findings, we outline and discuss prospective research directions concerning empirical studies with software practitioners, the curation of benchmark datasets, and the role of generative AI technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the 18th International Conference on Cooperative and Human Aspects of Software Engineering (CHASE '25)</p></details> |
| **[Steering Large Language Models between Code Execution and Textual Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03524v2)** | 2025-03-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While a lot of recent research focuses on enhancing the textual reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) by optimizing the multi-agent framework or reasoning chains, several benchmark tasks can be solved with 100\% success through direct coding, which is more scalable and avoids the computational overhead associated with textual iterating and searching. Textual reasoning has inherent limitations in solving tasks with challenges in math, logics, optimization, and searching, which is unlikely to be solved by simply scaling up the model and data size. The recently released OpenAI GPT Code Interpreter and multi-agent frameworks such as AutoGen have demonstrated remarkable proficiency of integrating code generation and execution to solve complex tasks using LLMs. However, based on our experiments on 7 existing popular methods for steering code/text generation in both single- and multi-turn settings with 14 tasks and 6 types of LLMs (including the new O1-preview), currently there is no optimal method to correctly steer LLMs to write code when needed. We discover some interesting patterns on when models use code vs. textual reasoning with the evolution to task complexity and model sizes, which even result in an astonishingly inverse scaling behavior. We also discover that results from LLM written code are not always better than using textual reasoning, even if the task could be solved through code. To mitigate the above issues, we propose three methods to better steer LLM code/text generation and achieve a notable improvement. The costs of token lengths and runtime are thoroughly discussed for all the methods. We believe the problem of steering LLM code/text generation is critical for future research and has much space for further improvement.

In this paper, we introduce a novel architecture Spike Talk via a unified representation of power and information as a means of data normalization using spikes for coordinated control of microgrids. This grid-edge technology allows each distributed energy resource (DER) to execute decentralized secondary control philosophy independently by interacting among each other using power flow along the tie-lines. Inspired from the field of computational neuroscience, Spike Talk basically builds on a fine-grained parallelism on the information transfer theory in our brains, particularly when neurons (modeled as DERs) transmit information (inferred from power streams measurable at each DER) through synapses (modeled as tie-lines). Not only does Spike Talk simplify and address the current bottlenecks of the cyber-physical architectural operation by dismissing the ICT layer, it provides intrinsic operational and cost-effective opportunities in terms of infrastructure development, computations and modeling. Hence, this paper provides a pedagogic illustration of the key concepts and design theories. Since we focus on coordinated control of microgrids in this paper, the signaling accuracy and system performance is studied for several neural coding schemes responsible for converting the real-valued local measurements into spikes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This paper is accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Smart Grid</p></details> |

We extend the degree table framework from the literature to cyclic-addition degree tables (CATs). By using roots of unity as evaluation points, we enable modulo-addition in the table. Based on CATs, we present an explicit construction, called CATx, that requires fewer workers than existing schemes in the low-privacy regime. Additionally, we present new families of schemes based on conventional degree tables, called GASPrs and DOGrs, that outperform the state-of-the-art for a wide range of parameters.</p></details> |  |
| **[SecRef*: Securely Sharing Mutable References Between Verified and Unverified Code in F*](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00404v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce SecRef*, a secure compilation framework protecting stateful programs verified in F* against linked unverified code, with which the program dynamically shares ML-style mutable references. To ease program verification in this setting, we propose a way of tracking which references are shareable with the unverified code, and which ones are not shareable and whose contents are thus guaranteed to be unchanged after calling into unverified code. This universal property of non-shareable references is exposed in the interface on which the verified program can rely when calling into unverified code. The remaining refinement types and pre- and post-conditions that the verified code expects from the unverified code are converted into dynamic checks about the shared references by using higher-order contracts. We prove formally in F* that this strategy ensures sound and secure interoperability with unverified code. Since SecRef* is built on top of the Monotonic State effect of F*, these proofs rely on the first monadic representation for this effect, which is a contribution of our work that can be of independent interest. Finally, we use SecRef* to build a simple cooperative multi-threading scheduler that is verified and that securely interacts with unverified threads.</p></details> | ICFP'25 submission |
| **[A Unified Framework for Automated Code Transformation and Pragma Insertion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03058v6)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>High-level synthesis, source-to-source compilers, and various Design Space Exploration techniques for pragma insertion have significantly improved the Quality of Results of generated designs. These tools offer benefits such as reduced development time and enhanced performance. However, achieving high-quality results often requires additional manual code transformations and tiling selections, which are typically performed separately or as pre-processing steps. Although DSE techniques enable code transformation upfront, the vastness of the search space often limits the exploration of all possible code transformations, making it challenging to determine which transformations are necessary. Additionally, ensuring correctness remains challenging, especially for complex transformations and optimizations. To tackle this obstacle, we first propose a comprehensive framework leveraging HLS compilers. Our system streamlines code transformation, pragma insertion, and tiles size selection for on-chip data caching through a unified optimization problem, aiming to enhance parallelization, particularly beneficial for computation-bound kernels. Them employing a novel Non-Linear Programming (NLP) approach, we simultaneously ascertain transformations, pragmas, and tile sizes, focusing on regular loop-based kernels. Our evaluation demonstrates that our framework adeptly identifies the appropriate transformations, including scenarios where no transformation is necessary, and inserts pragmas to achieve a favorable Quality of Results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differential Coding for Training-Free ANN-to-SNN Conversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00301v1)** | 2025-03-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit significant potential due to their low energy consumption. Converting Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to SNNs is an efficient way to achieve high-performance SNNs. However, many conversion methods are based on rate coding, which requires numerous spikes and longer time-steps compared to directly trained SNNs, leading to increased energy consumption and latency. This article introduces differential coding for ANN-to-SNN conversion, a novel coding scheme that reduces spike counts and energy consumption by transmitting changes in rate information rather than rates directly, and explores its application across various layers. Additionally, the threshold iteration method is proposed to optimize thresholds based on activation distribution when converting Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) to spiking neurons. Experimental results on various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers demonstrate that the proposed differential coding significantly improves accuracy while reducing energy consumption, particularly when combined with the threshold iteration method, achieving state-of-the-art performance.</p></details> |  |

We present a new dataset for ICD coding, which includes diagnosis fields from electronic health records (EHRs) annotated with over 10,000 entities and more than 1,500 unique ICD codes. This dataset serves as a benchmark for several state-of-the-art models, including BERT, LLaMA with LoRA, and RAG, with additional experiments examining transfer learning across domains (from PubMed abstracts to medical diagnosis) and terminologies (from UMLS concepts to ICD codes). We then apply the best-performing model to label an in-house EHR dataset containing patient histories from 2017 to 2021. Our experiments, conducted on a carefully curated test set, demonstrate that training with the automated predicted codes leads to a significant improvement in accuracy compared to manually annotated data from physicians. We believe our findings offer valuable insights into the potential for automating clinical coding in resource-limited languages like Russian, which could enhance clinical efficiency and data accuracy in these contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Transformer-based Decoder for Varshamov-Tenengolts Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21060v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the rise of DNA data storage technology has brought significant attention to the challenge of correcting insertion, deletion, and substitution (IDS) errors. Among various coding methods for IDS correction, Varshamov-Tenengolts (VT) codes, primarily designed for single-error correction, have emerged as a central research focus. While existing decoding methods achieve high accuracy in correcting a single error, they often fail to correct multiple IDS errors. In this work, we observe that VT codes retain some capability for addressing multiple errors by introducing a transformer-based VT decoder (TVTD) along with symbol- and statistic-based codeword embedding. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed TVTD achieves perfect correction of a single error. Furthermore, when decoding multiple errors across various codeword lengths, the bit error rate and frame error rate are significantly improved compared to existing hard decision and soft-in soft-out algorithms. Additionally, through model architecture optimization, the proposed method reduces time consumption by an order of magnitude compared to other soft decoders.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 2 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |

Vibrotactile communication could be useful in providing information without compropmising or loading a person's visual or auditory perception. This paper considers applications in Urban Search and Rescue (USAR) scenarios where a human working alongside a robot is likely to be operating in high cognitive load conditions. The focus is on understanding how best to convey information considering different vibrotactile information coding strategies to enhance scene understanding in scenarios where a robot might be operating remotely as a scout. In exploring information representation, this paper introduces Semantic Haptics, using shapes and patterns to represent certain events as if the skin was a screen, and shows how these lead to bettter learnability and interpreation accuracy.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pragmatic Reasoning improves LLM Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15835v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive potential in translating natural language (NL) instructions into program code. However, user instructions often contain inherent ambiguities, making it challenging for LLMs to generate code that accurately reflects the user's true intent. To address this challenge, researchers have proposed to produce multiple candidates of the program code and then rerank them to identify the best solution. In this paper, we propose CodeRSA, a novel code candidate reranking mechanism built upon the Rational Speech Act (RSA) framework, designed to guide LLMs toward more comprehensive pragmatic reasoning about user intent. We evaluate CodeRSA using one of the latest LLMs on a popular code generation dataset. Our experiment results show that CodeRSA consistently outperforms common baselines, surpasses the state-of-the-art approach in most cases, and demonstrates robust overall performance. These findings underscore the effectiveness of integrating pragmatic reasoning into code candidate reranking, offering a promising direction for enhancing code generation quality in LLMs.</p></details> |  |

ChartMimic utilizes information-intensive visual charts and textual instructions as inputs, requiring LMMs to generate the corresponding code for chart rendering. ChartMimic includes 4,800 human-curated (figure, instruction, code) triplets, which represent the authentic chart use cases found in scientific papers across various domains (e.g., Physics, Computer Science, Economics, etc). These charts span 18 regular types and 4 advanced types, diversifying into 201 subcategories. Furthermore, we propose multi-level evaluation metrics to provide an automatic and thorough assessment of the output code and the rendered charts. Unlike existing code generation benchmarks, ChartMimic places emphasis on evaluating LMMs' capacity to harmonize a blend of cognitive capabilities, encompassing visual understanding, code generation, and cross-modal reasoning. The evaluation of $3$ proprietary models and 14 open-weight models highlights the substantial challenges posed by ChartMimic. Even the advanced GPT-4o, InternVL2-Llama3-76B only achieved an average score across Direct Mimic and Customized Mimic tasks of 82.2 and 61.6, respectively, indicating significant room for improvement. We anticipate that ChartMimic will inspire the development of LMMs, advancing the pursuit of artificial general intelligence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICLR 2025.

| **[Data-Driven Invariant Learning for Probabilistic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2106.05421v4)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Morgan and McIver's weakest pre-expectation framework is one of the most well-established methods for deductive verification of probabilistic programs. Roughly, the idea is to generalize binary state assertions to real-valued expectations, which can measure expected values of probabilistic program quantities. While loop-free programs can be analyzed by mechanically transforming expectations, verifying loops usually requires finding an invariant expectation, a difficult task. We propose a new view of invariant expectation synthesis as a regression problem: given an input state, predict the average value of the post-expectation in the output distribution. Guided by this perspective, we develop the first data-driven invariant synthesis method for probabilistic programs. Unlike prior work on probabilistic invariant inference, our approach can learn piecewise continuous invariants without relying on template expectations, and also works with black-box access to the program. We also develop a data-driven approach to learn sub-invariants from data, which can be used to upper- or lower-bound expected values. We implement our approaches and demonstrate their effectiveness on a variety of benchmarks from the probabilistic programming literature.</p></details> | 37 pages |
| **[Parameterized Algorithms for Matching Integer Programs with Additional Rows and Columns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05548v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study integer linear programs (ILP) of the form $\min\{c^\top x\ \vert\ Ax=b,l\le x\le u,x\in\mathbb Z^n\}$ and analyze their parameterized complexity with respect to their distance to the generalized matching problem--following the well-established approach of capturing the hardness of a problem by the distance to triviality. The generalized matching problem is an ILP where each column of the constraint matrix has $1$-norm of at most $2$. It captures several well-known polynomial time solvable problems such as matching and flow problems. We parameterize by the size of variable and constraint backdoors, which measure the least number of columns or rows that must be deleted to obtain a generalized matching ILP. We present the following results: (i) a fixed-parameter tractable (FPT) algorithm for ILPs parameterized by the size $p$ of a minimum variable backdoor to generalized matching; (ii) a randomized slice-wise polynomial (XP) time algorithm for ILPs parameterized by the size $h$ of a minimum constraint backdoor to generalized matching as long as $c$ and $A$ are encoded in unary; (iii) we complement (ii) by proving that solving an ILP is W[1]-hard when parameterized by $h$ even when $c,A,l,u$ have coefficients of constant size. To obtain (i), we prove a variant of lattice-convexity of the degree sequences of weighted $b$-matchings, which we study in the light of SBO jump M-convex functions. This allows us to model the matching part as a polyhedral constraint on the integer backdoor variables. The resulting ILP is solved in FPT time using an integer programming algorithm. For (ii), the randomized XP time algorithm is obtained by pseudo-polynomially reducing the problem to the exact matching problem. To prevent an exponential blowup in terms of the encoding length of $b$, we bound the Graver complexity of the constraint matrix and employ a Graver augmentation local search framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Static Program Analysis Guided LLM Based Unit Test Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05394v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We describe a novel approach to automating unit test generation for Java methods using large language models (LLMs). Existing LLM-based approaches rely on sample usage(s) of the method to test (focal method) and/or provide the entire class of the focal method as input prompt and context. The former approach is often not viable due to the lack of sample usages, especially for newly written focal methods. The latter approach does not scale well enough; the bigger the complexity of the focal method and larger associated class, the harder it is to produce adequate test code (due to factors such as exceeding the prompt and context lengths of the underlying LLM). We show that augmenting prompts with \emph{concise} and \emph{precise} context information obtained by program analysis %of the focal method increases the effectiveness of generating unit test code through LLMs. We validate our approach on a large commercial Java project and a popular open-source Java project.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hints-In-Browser: Benchmarking Language Models for Programming Feedback Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.05053v2)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI and large language models hold great promise in enhancing programming education by generating individualized feedback and hints for learners. Recent works have primarily focused on improving the quality of generated feedback to achieve human tutors' quality. While quality is an important performance criterion, it is not the only criterion to optimize for real-world educational deployments. In this paper, we benchmark language models for programming feedback generation across several performance criteria, including quality, cost, time, and data privacy. The key idea is to leverage recent advances in the new paradigm of in-browser inference that allow running these models directly in the browser, thereby providing direct benefits across cost and data privacy. To boost the feedback quality of small models compatible with in-browser inference engines, we develop a fine-tuning pipeline based on GPT-4 generated synthetic data. We showcase the efficacy of fine-tuned Llama3-8B and Phi3-3.8B 4-bit quantized models using WebLLM's in-browser inference engine on three different Python programming datasets. We will release the full implementation along with a web app and datasets to facilitate further research on in-browser language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Logical Content of Logic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05355v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logic programming (LP) is typically understood through operational semantics (e.g., SLD-resolution) or model-theoretic interpretations (e.g., the least Herbrand model). This paper introduces a novel perspective on LP by defining a ``support'' relation that explicates what a program ``knows''. This interpretation is shown to express classical and intuitionistic logic, as well as an intermediate logic, depending on certain choices regarding LP and the meanings of disjunction and negation. These results are formalized using the idea of base-extension semantics within proof-theoretic semantics. Our approach offers new insights into the logical foundations of LP and has potential applications in knowledge representation, automated reasoning, and formal verification.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoIOT: LLM-Driven Automated Natural Language Programming for AIoT Applications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05346v1)** | 2025-03-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has profoundly transformed our lives, revolutionizing interactions with AI and lowering the barrier to AI usage. While LLMs are primarily designed for natural language interaction, the extensive embedded knowledge empowers them to comprehend digital sensor data. This capability enables LLMs to engage with the physical world through IoT sensors and actuators, performing a myriad of AIoT tasks. Consequently, this evolution triggers a paradigm shift in conventional AIoT application development, democratizing its accessibility to all by facilitating the design and development of AIoT applications via natural language. However, some limitations need to be addressed to unlock the full potential of LLMs in AIoT application development. First, existing solutions often require transferring raw sensor data to LLM servers, which raises privacy concerns, incurs high query fees, and is limited by token size. Moreover, the reasoning processes of LLMs are opaque to users, making it difficult to verify the robustness and correctness of inference results. This paper introduces AutoIOT, an LLM-based automated program generator for AIoT applications. AutoIOT enables users to specify their requirements using natural language (input) and automatically synthesizes interpretable programs with documentation (output). AutoIOT automates the iterative optimization to enhance the quality of generated code with minimum user involvement. AutoIOT not only makes the execution of AIoT tasks more explainable but also mitigates privacy concerns and reduces token costs with local execution of synthesized programs. Extensive experiments and user studies demonstrate AutoIOT's remarkable capability in program synthesis for various AIoT tasks. The synthesized programs can match and even outperform some representative baselines.</p></details> |  |

As quantum technologies advance toward industrial adoption, understanding programming aspects is crucial to addressing software development challenges. This study analyzes 6,935 quantum software programming discussion posts from Stack Exchange platforms (Quantum Computing, Stack Overflow, Software Engineering, and Code Review). Using topic modeling and qualitative analysis, we identified key discussion topics, trends (popular and difficult), tools/frameworks, and practitioner challenges. Twenty topics were identified, including popular ones such as physical theories and mathematical foundations, as well as security and encryption algorithms, while the most difficult were object-oriented programming and parameter control in quantum algorithms. Additionally, we identified nine frameworks that support quantum programming, with Qiskit emerging as the most widely adopted. Our findings also reveal core challenges in quantum software programming, thematically mapped into four areas: theories and mathematical concepts, algorithms and applications, experimental practices and software development, and education and community engagement. This study provides empirical insights that can inform future research, tool development, and educational efforts, supporting the evolution of the quantum software ecosystem.</p></details> |  |

These schemes exhibit significant storage overheads, hindering their practical application. This paper introduces ESSPI, an optimized method leveraging ECDSA/Schnorr signatures to sign the BitVMX program input. With Schnorr signatures we achieve an optimal 1:1 data expansion, compared to the current known best ratio of 1:200 based on Winternitz signatures. To accomplish this we introduce 4 innovations to BitVMX: (1) a modification of the BitVMX CPU, adding a challengeable hashing core to it, (2) a new partition-based search to detect fraud during hashing, (3) a new enhanced transaction DAG with added data-carrying transactions with a fraud-verifying smart-contract and (4) a novel timelock-based method for proving data availability to Bitcoin smart contracts. The enhanced BitVMX protocol enables the verification of uncompressed inputs such as SPV proofs, NiPoPoWs, or longer computation integrity proofs, such as STARKs.</p></details> |  |

The proposed `Word2Wave' (W2W) framework enables interactive programming and parameter configuration of AUVs for remote subsea missions. The W2W framework includes: (i) a set of novel language rules and command structures for efficient language-to-mission mapping; (ii) a GPT-based prompt engineering module for training data generation; (iii) a small language model (SLM)-based sequence-to-sequence learning pipeline for mission command generation from human speech or text; and (iv) a novel user interface for 2D mission map visualization and human-machine interfacing. The proposed learning pipeline adapts an SLM named T5-Small that can learn language-to-mission mapping from processed language data effectively, providing robust and efficient performance. In addition to a benchmark evaluation with state-of-the-art, we conduct a user interaction study to demonstrate the effectiveness of W2W over commercial AUV programming interfaces. Across participants, W2W-based programming required less than 10\% time for mission programming compared to traditional interfaces; it is deemed to be a simpler and more natural paradigm for subsea mission programming with a usability score of 76.25. W2W opens up promising future research opportunities on hands-free AUV mission programming for efficient subsea deployments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Modular Reasoning about Error Bounds for Concurrent Probabilistic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04512v1)** | 2025-03-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Coneris, the first higher-order concurrent separation logic for reasoning about error probability bounds of higher-order concurrent probabilistic programs with higher-order state. To support modular reasoning about concurrent (non-probabilistic) program modules, state-of-the-art program logics internalize the classic notion of linearizability within the logic through the concept of logical atomicity. Coneris extends this idea to probabilistic concurrent program modules. Thus Coneris supports modular reasoning about probabilistic concurrent modules by capturing a novel notion of randomized logical atomicity within the logic. To do so, Coneris utilizes presampling tapes and a novel probabilistic update modality to describe how state is changed probabilistically at linearization points.

Empirical observations show that current systems tend to produce incomplete next object location distributions. We introduce a system which addresses this problem. We design a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that specifies functional constraints. Programs from our language take as input a partial scene and object to place. Upon execution they predict possible object placements. We design a generative model which writes these programs automatically. Available 3D scene datasets do not contain programs to train on, so we build upon previous work in unsupervised program induction to introduce a new program bootstrapping algorithm. In order to quantify our empirical observations we introduce a new evaluation procedure which captures how well a system models per-object location distributions. We ask human annotators to label all the possible places an object can go in a scene and show that our system produces per-object location distributions more consistent with human annotators. Our system also generates indoor scenes of comparable quality to previous systems and while previous systems degrade in performance when training data is sparse, our system does not degrade to the same degree.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 20 figures Subjects: Graphics (cs.GR), Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition (cs.CV), Machine Learning (cs.LG)</p></details> |

This highlights a need to teach students how to effectively interact with AI models, particularly through natural language prompts, to generate and critically evaluate code for solving computational tasks. To address this, we developed a novel platform for prompt programming that enables authentic dialogue-based interactions, supports problems involving multiple interdependent functions, and offers on-request execution of generated code. Data analysis from over 900 students in an introductory programming course revealed high engagement, with the majority of prompts occurring within multi-turn dialogues. Problems with multiple interdependent functions encouraged iterative refinement, with progression graphs highlighting several common strategies. Students were highly selective about the code they chose to test, suggesting that on-request execution of generated code promoted critical thinking. Given the growing importance of learning dialogue-based programming with AI, we provide this tool as a publicly accessible resource, accompanied by a corpus of programming problems for educational use.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of the ITiCSE'25 paper</p></details> |

Developers increasingly use them for their work, including generating code to fulfil the data protection requirements (privacy) of the apps they build. We wanted to know if the reality is the same as expectations of AI-based programming assistants when trying to fulfil software privacy requirements, and the challenges developers face when using AI-based programming assistants and how these can be improved. To this end, we conducted a survey with 51 developers worldwide. We found that AI-based programming assistants need to be improved in order for developers to better trust them with generating code that ensures privacy. In this paper, we provide some practical recommendations for developers to consider following when using AI-based programming assistants for privacy-related code development, and some key further research directions.</p></details> |  |

Recently, Memory-Safe WebAssembly (MSWASM) is introduced as a general-purpose intermediate bytecode with built-in memory safety semantics. Programs written in C can be compiled into MSWASM to get complete memory safety protection. In this paper, we present our extensions on MSWASM, which improve its semantics and practicality. First, we formalize MSWASM semantics in Coq/Iris, extending it with inter-module interaction, showing that MSWASM provides fine-grained isolation guarantees analogous to WASM's coarse-grained isolation via linear memory. Second, we present Aegis, a system to adopt the memory safety of MSWASM for C programs in an interoperable way. Aegis pipeline generates Checked C source code from MSWASM modules to enforce spatial memory safety. Checked C is a recent binary-compatible extension of C which can provide guaranteed spatial safety. Our design allows Aegis to protect C programs that depend on legacy C libraries with no extra dependency and with low overhead. Aegis pipeline incurs 67% runtime overhead and near-zero memory overhead on PolyBenchC programs compared to native.</p></details> |  |

However, a central problem remains: translating theoretical ideas into robust implementations in the highly specialized context of pharmaceutical research. This limitation prevents practitioners from making full use of the latest AI developments in drug discovery. To address this challenge, we introduce DrugAgent, a multi-agent framework that automates machine learning (ML) programming for drug discovery tasks. DrugAgent employs an LLM Planner that formulates high-level ideas and an LLM Instructor that identifies and integrates domain knowledge when implementing those ideas. We present case studies on three representative drug discovery tasks. Our results show that DrugAgent consistently outperforms leading baselines, including a relative improvement of 4.92% in ROC-AUC compared to ReAct for drug-target interaction (DTI). DrugAgent is publicly available at https://anonymous.4open.science/r/drugagent-5C42/.</p></details> |  |

For the overall system dynamics, a two-degrees-of-freedom (2-DOF) vehicle model is established and a two-point preview driver model is adopted. A dynamic authority allocation strategy based on cooperation level is proposed to combine the steering input of the human driver and the automatic controller. To make further improvements in the controller design, three main contributions are put forward. Firstly, the CNF controller is designed for trajectory tracking control with refined transient performance. Besides, the self-triggered rule is applied such that the system will update in discrete times to save computing resources and increase efficiency. Moreover, by introducing the data-based ADP algorithm, the optimal control problem can be solved through iteration using system input and output information, reducing the need for accurate knowledge of system dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed control method is validated through Carsim-Simulink co-simulations in diverse driving scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics (12 pages)</p></details> |

Specifically, we design a domain-specific language (DSL) to hierarchically represent building structures as a program, which can be efficiently converted into a mesh. We bridge feedforward and inverse procedural modeling by using a feedforward process for training data synthesis, allowing the network to make reverse predictions. We train an encoder-decoder on the points-program pairs to establish a mapping from unstructured point clouds to architectural programs, where a 3D convolutional encoder extracts point cloud features and a transformer decoder autoregressively predicts the programs in a tokenized form. Inference by our method is highly efficient and produces plausible and faithful 3D abstractions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that ArcPro outperforms both traditional architectural proxy reconstruction and learning-based abstraction methods. We further explore its potential to work with multi-view image and natural language inputs.</p></details> | <details><summary>CVPR ...</summary><p>CVPR 2025 (Patent Protected); Project page: https://vcc.tech/research/2025/ArcPro</p></details> |

The while-language we consider is a simple computation model that can simulate (and be simulated by) Turing machines with a linear time and constant space blow-up. Our framework derives while-programs from functional programs written in a subset of Isabelle/HOL, namely tail-recursive functions with first-order arguments and algebraic datatypes. As far as we are aware, it is the first framework targeting a computation model that is reasonable in time and space from a complexity-theoretic perspective.</p></details> |  |
| **[Denotational Semantics for Probabilistic and Concurrent Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02768v1)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We develop a denotational model for programs that have standard programming constructs such as conditionals and while-loops, as well as probabilistic and concurrent commands. Whereas semantic models for languages with either concurrency or randomization are well studied, their combination is limited to languages with bounded loops. Our work is the first to consider both randomization and concurrency for a language with unbounded looping constructs. The interaction between Boolean tests (arising from the control flow structures), probabilistic actions, and concurrent execution creates challenges in generalizing previous work on pomsets and convex languages, prominent models for those effects, individually. To illustrate the generality of our model, we show that it recovers a typical powerdomain semantics for concurrency, as well as the convex powerset semantics for probabilistic nondeterminism.</p></details> |  |

Exploring and Evaluating the Design and Trade-offs of Proactive AI Programming Support](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18658v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI programming tools enable powerful code generation, and recent prototypes attempt to reduce user effort with proactive AI agents, but their impact on programming workflows remains unexplored. We introduce and evaluate Codellaborator, a design probe LLM agent that initiates programming assistance based on editor activities and task context. We explored three interface variants to assess trade-offs between increasingly salient AI support: prompt-only, proactive agent, and proactive agent with presence and context (Codellaborator). In a within-subject study (N=18), we find that proactive agents increase efficiency compared to prompt-only paradigm, but also incur workflow disruptions. However, presence indicators and interaction context support alleviated disruptions and improved users' awareness of AI processes. We underscore trade-offs of Codellaborator on user control, ownership, and code understanding, emphasizing the need to adapt proactivity to programming processes. Our research contributes to the design exploration and evaluation of proactive AI systems, presenting design implications on AI-integrated programming workflow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Integrating Various Software Artifacts for Better LLM-based Bug Localization and Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.03905v2)** | 2025-03-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs have garnered considerable attention for their potential to streamline Automated Program Repair (APR). LLM-based approaches can either insert the correct code or directly generate patches when provided with buggy methods. However, most of LLM-based APR methods rely on a single type of software information, without fully leveraging different software artifacts. Despite this, many LLM-based approaches do not explore which specific types of information best assist in APR. Addressing this gap is crucial for advancing LLM-based APR techniques. We propose DEVLoRe to use issue content (description and message) and stack error traces to localize buggy methods, then rely on debug information in buggy methods and issue content and stack error to localize buggy lines and generate plausible patches which can pass all unit tests. The results show that while issue content is particularly effective in assisting LLMs with fault localization and program repair, different types of software artifacts complement each other. By incorporating different artifacts, DEVLoRe successfully locates 49.3% and 47.6% of single and non-single buggy methods and generates 56.0% and 14.5% plausible patches for the Defects4J v2.0 dataset, respectively. This outperforms current state-of-the-art APR methods. The source code and experimental results of this work for replication are available at https://github.com/XYZboom/DEVLoRe.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 11 images, 9 tables, Manuscript submitted to a journal (2024)</p></details> |
| **[Optimizing Robot Programming: Mixed Reality Gripper Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02042v1)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Conventional robot programming methods are complex and time-consuming for users. In recent years, alternative approaches such as mixed reality have been explored to address these challenges and optimize robot programming. While the findings of the mixed reality robot programming methods are convincing, most existing methods rely on gesture interaction for robot programming. Since controller-based interactions have proven to be more reliable, this paper examines three controller-based programming methods within a mixed reality scenario: 1) Classical Jogging, where the user positions the robot's end effector using the controller's thumbsticks, 2) Direct Control, where the controller's position and orientation directly corresponds to the end effector's, and 3) Gripper Control, where the controller is enhanced with a 3D-printed gripper attachment to grasp and release objects. A within-subjects study (n = 30) was conducted to compare these methods. The findings indicate that the Gripper Control condition outperforms the others in terms of task completion time, user experience, mental demand, and task performance, while also being the preferred method. Therefore, it demonstrates promising potential as an effective and efficient approach for future robot programming.

As individual network sizes quickly scale beyond the dimensional capabilities of single crossbars, networks must be mapped onto multiple crossbars. Crossbar sizes within modern Memristor Crossbar Architectures are determined predominately not by device technology but by network topology; more, smaller crossbars consume less area thanks to the high structural sparsity found in larger, brain-inspired SNNs. Motivated by continuing increases in SNN sparsity due to improvements in training methods, we propose utilizing heterogeneous crossbar sizes to further reduce area consumption. This approach was previously unachievable as prior compiler studies only explored solutions targeting homogeneous MCAs. Our work improves on the state-of-the-art by providing Integer Linear Programming formulations supporting arbitrarily heterogeneous architectures. By modeling axonal interactions between neurons our methods produce better mappings while removing inhibitive a priori knowledge requirements. We first show a 16.7-27.6% reduction in area consumption for square-crossbar homogeneous architectures. Then, we demonstrate 66.9-72.7% further reduction when using a reasonable configuration of heterogeneous crossbar dimensions. Next, we present a new optimization formulation capable of minimizing the number of inter-crossbar routes. When applied to solutions already near-optimal in area an 11.9-26.4% routing reduction is observed without impacting area consumption. Finally, we present a profile-guided optimization capable of minimizing the number of runtime spikes between crossbars. Compared to the best-area-then-route optimized solutions we observe a further 0.5-14.8% inter-crossbar spike reduction while requiring 1-3 orders of magnitude less solver time.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in DATE'25</p></details> |
| **[Predicting post-release defects with knowledge units (KUs) of programming languages: an empirical study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.02907v2)** | 2025-03-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Defect prediction plays a crucial role in software engineering, enabling developers to identify defect-prone code and improve software quality. While extensive research has focused on refining machine learning models for defect prediction, the exploration of new data sources for feature engineering remains limited. Defect prediction models primarily rely on traditional metrics such as product, process, and code ownership metrics, which, while effective, do not capture language-specific traits that may influence defect proneness. To address this gap, we introduce Knowledge Units (KUs) of programming languages as a novel feature set for analyzing software systems and defect prediction. A KU is a cohesive set of key capabilities that are offered by one or more building blocks of a given programming language. We conduct an empirical study leveraging 28 KUs that are derived from Java certification exams and compare their effectiveness against traditional metrics in predicting post-release defects across 8 well-maintained Java software systems. Our results show that KUs provide significant predictive power, achieving a median AUC of 0.82, outperforming individual group of traditional metric-based models. Among KU features, Method & Encapsulation, Inheritance, and Exception Handling emerge as the most influential predictors. Furthermore, combining KUs with traditional metrics enhances prediction performance, yielding a median AUC of 0.89. We also introduce a cost-effective model using only 10 features, which maintains strong predictive performance while reducing feature engineering costs. Our findings demonstrate the value of KUs in predicting post-release defects, offering a complementary perspective to traditional metrics. This study can be helpful to researchers who wish to analyze software systems from a perspective that is complementary to that of traditional metrics.</p></details> |  |

These methods predict a solution and fix a subset of variables to reduce the problem dimension. Then, they solve the reduced problem to obtain the final solutions. However, directly fixing variable values can lead to low-quality solutions or even infeasible reduced problems if the predicted solution is not accurate enough. To address this challenge, we propose an Alternating prediction-correction neural solving framework (Apollo-MILP) that can identify and select accurate and reliable predicted values to fix. In each iteration, Apollo-MILP conducts a prediction step for the unfixed variables, followed by a correction step to obtain an improved solution (called reference solution) through a trust-region search. By incorporating the predicted and reference solutions, we introduce a novel Uncertainty-based Error upper BOund (UEBO) to evaluate the uncertainty of the predicted values and fix those with high confidence. A notable feature of Apollo-MILP is the superior ability for problem reduction while preserving optimality, leading to high-quality final solutions. Experiments on commonly used benchmarks demonstrate that our proposed Apollo-MILP significantly outperforms other ML-based approaches in terms of solution quality, achieving over a 50% reduction in the solution gap.</p></details> |  |

This paper addresses the challenges of developing a compilation algorithm that optimizes memory management and scales well for bigger, more complex circuits. Our approach models the high-level quantum code as a control flow graph and presents a workflow that searches for a topological sort that maximizes opportunities for qubit reuse. Various heuristics for qubit reuse strategies handle the trade-off between circuit width and depth. We also explore scalability issues in large circuits, suggesting methods to mitigate compilation bottlenecks. By analyzing the structure of the circuit, we are able to identify sub-problems that can be solved separately, without a significant effect on circuit quality, while reducing runtime significantly. This method lays the groundwork for future advancements in quantum programming and compiler optimization by incorporating scalability into quantum memory management.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we introduce a new Mixed-Integer Conic Program (MICP) formulation for the Multi-Agent Moving-Target Traveling Salesman Problem (MA-MT-TSP), a generalization of the MT-TSP involving multiple agents. Our approach begins by restating the current state-of-the-art MICP formulation for MA-MT-TSP as a Nonconvex Mixed-Integer Nonlinear Program (MINLP), followed by a novel reformulation into a new MICP. We present computational results demonstrating that our formulation outperforms the state-of-the-art, achieving up to two orders of magnitude reduction in runtime, and over 90% improvement in optimality gap.</p></details> | 7 pages, 3 figures |

However, code LLMs cannot synthesize specialized programs when tasked with IoT applications that require domain knowledge. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) offers a promising solution by fetching relevant domain knowledge, it necessitates powerful cloud LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) to process user requirements and retrieved contents, which raises significant privacy concerns. This approach also suffers from unstable networks and prohibitive LLM query costs. Moreover, it is challenging to ensure the correctness and relevance of the fetched contents. To address these issues, we propose GPIoT, a code generation system for IoT applications by fine-tuning locally deployable Small Language Models (SLMs) on IoT-specialized datasets. SLMs have smaller model sizes, allowing efficient local deployment and execution to mitigate privacy concerns and network uncertainty. Furthermore, by fine-tuning the SLMs with our IoT-specialized datasets, the SLMs' ability to synthesize IoT-related programs can be substantially improved. To evaluate GPIoT's capability in synthesizing programs for IoT applications, we develop a benchmark, IoTBench. Extensive experiments and user trials demonstrate the effectiveness of GPIoT in generating IoT-specialized code, outperforming state-of-the-art code LLMs with an average task accuracy increment of 64.7% and significant improvements in user satisfaction.</p></details> |  |

Despite this, developers still need to manually inspect each patch to confirm its correctness, which is tedious and time-consuming. This challenge is exacerbated in the presence of plausible patches, which accidentally pass test cases but may not correctly fix the bug. To address this challenge, we propose an interactive approach called iFix to facilitate patch understanding and comparison based on their runtime difference. iFix performs static analysis to identify runtime variables related to the buggy statement and captures their runtime values during execution for each patch. These values are then aligned across different patch candidates, allowing users to compare and contrast their runtime behavior. To evaluate iFix, we conducted a within-subjects user study with 28 participants. Compared with manual inspection and a state-of-the-art interactive patch filtering technique, iFix reduced participants' task completion time by 36% and 33% while also improving their confidence by 50% and 20%, respectively. Besides, quantitative experiments demonstrate that iFix improves the ranking of correct patches by at least 39% compared with other patch ranking methods and is generalizable to different APR tools.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 8 figures, OOPSLA 2025</p></details> |

To assist humans in repairing them, we propose to automatically decompose complex solutions into multiple simpler pieces that correspond to specific subtasks. We introduce a novel objective for learning task decomposition, termed assistive value (AssistV), which measures the feasibility and speed for humans to repair the decomposed solution. We collect a dataset of human repair experiences on different decomposed solutions. Utilizing the collected data as in-context examples, we then learn to critique, refine, and rank decomposed solutions to improve AssistV. We validate our method under competitive programming problems: under 177 hours of human study, our method enables non-experts to solve 33.3\% more problems, speeds them up by 3.3x, and empowers them to match unassisted experts.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2024 Main Conference</p></details> |

Unlike traditional approaches for program realization that assume full agent control or rely on incremental search, we address scenarios where environmental nondeterminism significantly influences program outcomes. Our synthesis problem involves deriving a policy that successfully realizes a given Golog program while ensuring the satisfaction of a temporal specification, expressed in Linear Temporal Logic on finite traces (LTLf), across all possible environmental behaviors. By leveraging an expressive class of first-order action theories, we construct a finite game arena that encapsulates program executions and tracks the satisfaction of the temporal goal. A game-theoretic approach is employed to derive such a policy. Experimental results demonstrate this approach's feasibility in domains with unbounded objects and non-local effects. This work bridges agent programming and temporal logic synthesis, providing a framework for robust agent behavior in nondeterministic environments.</p></details> | AAAI'25 |

However, existing research often focuses on individual tools rather than deriving broader design recommendations. A key challenge in designing these systems is balancing learner control with system-driven guidance. To explore user preferences for AI-supported programming learning tools, we conducted a participatory design study with 15 undergraduate novice programmers and 10 instructors to gather insights on their desired help features and control preferences, as well as a follow-up survey with 172 introductory programming students. Our qualitative findings show that learners prefer help that is encouraging, incorporates visual aids, and includes peer-related insights, whereas instructors prioritize scaffolding that reflects learners' progress and reinforces best practices. Both groups favor shared control, though learners generally prefer more autonomy, while instructors lean toward greater system guidance to prevent cognitive overload. Additionally, our interviews revealed individual differences in control preferences. Based on our findings, we propose design guidelines for AI-supported programming tools, particularly regarding user-centered help features and adaptive control mechanisms. Our work contributes to the human-centered design of AI-supported learning environments by informing the development of systems that effectively balance autonomy and guidance, enhancing AI-supported educational tools for programming and beyond.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Consistent Are Humans When Grading Programming Assignments?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2409.12967v2)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Providing consistent summative assessment to students is important, as the grades they are awarded affect their progression through university and future career prospects. While small cohorts are typically assessed by a single assessor, such as the class leader, larger cohorts are often assessed by multiple assessors, which increases the risk of inconsistent grading. To investigate the consistency of human grading of programming assignments, we asked 28 participants to each grade 40 CS1 introductory Java assignments, providing grades and feedback for correctness, code elegance, readability and documentation; the 40 assignments were split into two batches of 20. In the second batch of 20, we duplicated one assignment from the first to analyse the internal consistency of individual assessors. We measured the inter-rater reliability of the groups using Krippendorf's $\alpha$ -- an $\alpha > 0.667$ is recommended to make tentative conclusions based on the rating. Our groups were inconsistent, with an average $\alpha = 0.2$ when grading correctness and an average $\alpha < 0.1$ for code elegance, readability and documentation. To measure the individual consistency of graders, we measured the distance between the grades they awarded for the duplicated assignment in batch one and batch two. Only one participant of the 22 who didn't notice that the assignment was a duplicate was awarded the same grade for correctness, code elegance, readability and documentation. The average grade difference was 1.79 for correctness and less than 1.6 for code elegance, readability and documentation. Our results show that human graders in our study can not agree on the grade to give a piece of student work and are often individually inconsistent, suggesting that the idea of a ``gold standard'' of human grading might be flawed, and highlights that a shared rubric alone is not enough to ensure consistency.</p></details> |  |

This work explores the design and implementation of proactive AI assistants powered by large language models. We first outline the key design considerations for building effective proactive assistants. As a case study, we propose a proactive chat-based programming assistant that automatically provides suggestions and facilitates their integration into the programmer's code. The programming context provides a shared workspace enabling the assistant to offer more relevant suggestions. We conducted a randomized experimental study examining the impact of various design elements of the proactive assistant on programmer productivity and user experience. Our findings reveal significant benefits of incorporating proactive chat assistants into coding environments and uncover important nuances that influence their usage and effectiveness.</p></details> | CHI 2025 |
| **[Extending the OmpSs-2 Programming Model for Hybrid Quantum-Classical Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.21104v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The OmpSs-2 programming model is used in HPC programs to parallelize code and offload code to accelerators. In this work, we extend the offloading capability to quantum computers. We explain the necessary changes to the Clang compiler and the Nanos6 runtime, which are both part of OmpSs-2. In addition, we develop a simulator that simulates a quantum computer in the network and receives the jobs offloaded by the runtime. Four detailed examples show how our programming model can be used to write hybrid quantum-classical software. The examples are random number generation, a parameter scan using the mean-field ansatz, a variational algorithm using this ansatz, and handwritten digit recognition using a hybrid convolutional neural network.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProBench: Benchmarking Large Language Models in Competitive Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20868v1)** | 2025-02-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With reasoning language models such as OpenAI-o3 and DeepSeek-R1 emerging, large language models (LLMs) have entered a new phase of development. However, existing benchmarks for coding evaluation are gradually inadequate to assess the capability of advanced LLMs in code reasoning. To bridge the gap for high-level code reasoning assessment, we propose ProBench to benchmark LLMs in competitive programming, drawing inspiration from the International Collegiate Programming Contest. ProBench collects a comprehensive set of competitive programming problems from Codeforces, Luogu, and Nowcoder platforms during the period from July to December 2024, obtaining real test results through online submissions to ensure the fairness and accuracy of the evaluation. We establish a unified problem attribute system, including difficulty grading and algorithm tagging. With carefully collected and annotated data in ProBench, we systematically assess 9 latest LLMs in competitive programming across multiple dimensions, including thought chain analysis, error type diagnosis, and reasoning depth evaluation. Experimental results show that QwQ-32B-Preview achieves the best score of 20.93 followed by DeepSeek-V3 with a score of 16.38, suggesting that models trained with specialized reasoning tasks significantly outperform general-purpose models (even larger than reasoning-oriented models) in programming. Further analysis also reveals key areas for programming capability enhancement, e.g., algorithm adaptability and reasoning sufficiency, providing important insights for the future development of reasoning models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probing the Design Space: Parallel Versions for Exploratory Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20535v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Exploratory programming involves open-ended tasks. To evaluate their progress on these, programmers require frequent feedback and means to tell if the feedback they observe is bringing them in the right direction. Collecting, comparing, and sharing feedback is typically done through ad-hoc means: relying on memory to compare outputs, code comments, or manual screenshots. To approach this issue, we designed Exploriants: an extension to example-based live programming. Exploriants allows programmers to place variation points. It collects outputs captured in probes and presents them in a comparison view that programmers can customize to suit their program domain. We find that the addition of variation points and the comparisons view encourages a structured approach to exploring variations of a program. We demonstrate Exploriants' capabilities and applicability in three case studies on image processing, data processing, and game development. Given Exploriants, exploratory programmers are given a straightforward means to evaluate their progress and do not have to rely on ad-hoc methods that may introduce errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Consistent Distributed Reactive Programming with Retroactive Computation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20534v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Many systems require receiving data from multiple information sources, which act as distributed network devices that asynchronously send the latest data at their own pace to generalize various kinds of devices and connections, known as the Internet of Things (IoT). These systems often perform computations both **reactively** and **retroactively** on information received from the sources for monitoring and analytical purposes, respectively. Inquiry: It is challenging to design a programming language that can describe such systems at a high level of abstraction for two reasons: (1) reactive and retroactive computations in these systems are performed alongside the execution of other application logic; and (2) information sources may be distributed, and data from these sources may arrive late or be lost entirely. Addressing these difficulties is our fundamental problem. Approach: We propose a programming language that supports the following features. First, our language incorporates reactive time-varying values (also known as signals) embedded within an imperative language. Second, it supports multiple information sources that are distributed and represented as signals, meaning they can be declaratively composed to form other time-varying values. Finally, it allows computation over past values collected from information sources and recovery from inconsistency caused by packet loss. To address the aforementioned difficulties, we develop a core calculus for this proposed language. Knowledge: This calculus is a hybrid of reactive/retroactive computations and imperative ones. Because of this hybrid nature, the calculus is inherently complex; however, we have simplified it as much as possible. First, its semantics are modeled as a simple, single-threaded abstraction based on typeless object calculus. Meanwhile, reactive computations that execute in parallel are modeled using a simple process calculus and are integrated with the object calculus, ensuring that the computation results are always serialized. Specifically, we show that time consistency is guaranteed in the calculus; in other words, consistency can be recovered at any checkpoint. Grounding: This work is supported by formally stating and proving theorems regarding time consistency. We also conducted a microbenchmarking experiment to demonstrate that the implemented recovery process is feasible in our assumed application scenarios. Importance: The ensured time consistency provides a rigorous foundation for performing analytics on computation results obtained from distributed information sources, even when these sources experience delays or packet loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dynamic Program Slices Change How Developers Diagnose Gradual Run-Time Type Errors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20533v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A gradual type system allows developers to declare certain types to be enforced by the compiler (i.e., statically typed), while leaving other types to be enforced via runtime checks (i.e., dynamically typed). When runtime checks fail, debugging gradually typed programs becomes cumbersome, because these failures may arise far from the original point where an inconsistent type assumption is made. To ease this burden on developers, some gradually typed languages produce a blame report for a given type inconsistency. However, these reports are sometimes misleading, because they might point to program points that do not need to be changed to stop the error. To overcome the limitations of blame reports, we propose using dynamic program slicing as an alternative approach to help programmers debug run-time type errors. We describe a proof-of-concept for TypeSlicer, a tool that would present dynamic program slices to developers when a runtime check fails. We performed a Wizard-of-Oz user study to investigate how developers respond to dynamic program slices through a set of simulated interactions with TypeScript programs. This formative study shows that developers can understand and apply dynamic slice information to provide change recommendations when debugging runtime type errors.</p></details> |  |
| **[Supervised Fine-Tuning LLMs to Behave as Pedagogical Agents in Programming Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20527v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly being explored in higher education, yet their effectiveness as teaching agents remains underexamined. In this paper, we present the development of GuideLM, a fine-tuned LLM designed for programming education. GuideLM has been integrated into the Debugging C Compiler (DCC), an educational C compiler that leverages LLMs to generate pedagogically sound error explanations. Previously, DCC relied on off-the-shelf OpenAI models, which, while accurate, often over-assisted students by directly providing solutions despite contrary prompting. To address this, we employed supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on a dataset of 528 student-question/teacher-answer pairs, creating two models: GuideLM and GuideLM-mini, fine-tuned on ChatGPT-4o and 4o-mini, respectively. We conducted an expert analysis of 400 responses per model, comparing their pedagogical effectiveness against base OpenAI models. Our evaluation, grounded in constructivism and cognitive load theory, assessed factors such as conceptual scaffolding, clarity, and Socratic guidance. Results indicate that GuideLM and GuideLM-mini improve pedagogical performance, with an 8% increase in Socratic guidance and a 58% improvement in economy of words compared to GPT-4o. However, this refinement comes at the cost of a slight reduction in general accuracy. While further work is needed, our findings suggest that fine-tuning LLMs with targeted datasets is a promising approach for developing models better suited to educational contexts.</p></details> |  |
| **[Two Approaches for Programming Education in the Domain of Graphics: An Experiment](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20526v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Context: Graphics is a popular domain for teaching introductory programming in a motivating way, even in text-based programming languages. Over the last few decades, a large number of libraries using different approaches have been developed for this purpose. Inquiry: Prior work in introductory programming that uses graphics as input and output has shown positive results in terms of engagement, but research is scarce on whether learners are able to use programming concepts learned through graphics for programming in other domains, transferring what they have learned. Approach: We conducted a randomized, controlled experiment with 145 students as participants divided into two groups. Both groups programmed using graphics in Python, but used different approaches: one group used a compositional graphics library named PyTamaro; the other used the Turtle graphics library from Python's standard library. Student engagement was assessed with surveys, and programming knowledge with a post-test on general programming concepts and programming tasks in the domain of graphics. Knowledge: We find few differences between the two groups on the post-test, despite the PyTamaro group having practiced on problems isomorphic to those in the post-test. The participants traced a compositional graphics program more accurately than a 'comparable' turtle graphics program. Both groups report high engagement and perceived learning; both perform well on simple program-writing tasks to create graphics. Grounding: Our findings are based on a controlled experiment with a count of 145 participants, which exceeds the sample size indicated by power analysis to detect a medium effect size. The complete instrument and teaching materials used in the study are available as appendixes. Importance: This study adds further evidence that graphics is an engaging domain for introductory programming; moreover, it shows that the compositional graphics approach adopted by PyTamaro yields engagement levels comparable to the venerable turtle approach. Compositional graphics code appears to be easier to trace than turtle graphics code. As for conceptual knowledge, our results indicate that practicing on programming tasks isomorphic to those of the test can still not be enough to achieve better transfer. This challenges programming educators and researchers to investigate further which graphics-based approaches work best and how to facilitate transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Programming Really Is Simple Mathematics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17149v3)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A re-construction of the fundamentals of programming as a small mathematical theory (PRISM) based on elementary set theory. Highlights: $\bullet$ Zero axioms. No properties are assumed, all are proved (from standard set theory). $\bullet$ A single concept covers specifications and programs. $\bullet$ Its definition only involves one relation and one set. $\bullet$ Everything proceeds from three operations: choice, composition and restriction. $\bullet$ These techniques suffice to derive the axioms of classic papers on the "laws of programming" as consequences and prove them mechanically. $\bullet$ The ordinary subset operator suffices to define both the notion of program correctness and the concepts of specialization and refinement. $\bullet$ From this basis, the theory deduces dozens of theorems characterizing important properties of programs and programming. $\bullet$ All these theorems have been mechanically verified (using Isabelle/HOL); the proofs are available in a public repository. This paper is a considerable extension and rewrite of an earlier contribution [arXiv:1507.00723]</p></details> |  |
| **[LangProBe: a Language Programs Benchmark](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.20315v1)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Composing language models (LMs) into multi-step language programs and automatically optimizing their modular prompts is now a mainstream paradigm for building AI systems, but the tradeoffs in this space have only scarcely been studied before. We introduce LangProBe, the first large-scale benchmark for evaluating the architectures and optimization strategies for language programs, with over 2000 combinations of tasks, architectures, optimizers, and choices of LMs. Using LangProBe, we are the first to study the impact of program architectures and optimizers (and their compositions together and with different models) on tradeoffs of quality and cost. We find that optimized language programs offer strong cost--quality Pareto improvement over raw calls to models, but simultaneously demonstrate that human judgment (or empirical decisions) about which compositions to pursue is still necessary for best performance. We will open source the code and evaluation data for LangProBe.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bugfix: a standard language, database schema and repository for research on bugs and automatic program repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15599v2)** | 2025-02-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic Program Repair (APR) is a brilliant idea: when detecting a bug, also provide suggestions for correcting the program. Progress towards that goal is hindered by the absence of a common frame of reference for the multiplicity of APR ideas, methods, tools, programming languages and environments. Bugfix is an effort at providing such a framework: a standardized set of notations, tools and interfaces, as well as a database of bugs and fixes, for use by the APR research community to try out ideas and compare results. The most directly visible component of the Bugfix effort is the Bugfix language, a human-readable formalism making it possible to describe elements of the following kinds: a bug (described abstractly, for example the permutation of two arguments in a call); a bug example (an actual occurrence of a bug, in a specific code written in a specific programming language, and usually recorded in some repository); a fix (a particular correction of a bug, obtained for example by reversing the misplaced arguments); an application (an entity that demonstrates how a actual code example matches with a fix); a construct (the abstract description of a programming mechanism, for example a ``while'' loop, independently of its realization in a programming language; and a language (a description of how a particular programming language includes certain constructs and provides specific concrete syntax for each of them -- for example Java includes loop, assignment etc. and has a defined format for each of them). A JSON API provides it in a form accessible to tools. Bugfix includes a repository containing a considerable amount of bugs, examples and fixes. Note: An early step towards this article was a short contribution (Ref [1]) to the 2024 ICSE. The present text reuses a few elements of introduction and motivation but is otherwise thoroughly reworked and extended.</p></details> |  |
| **[Program Synthesis Dialog Agents for Interactive Decision-Making](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19610v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world eligibility problems, ranging from medical diagnosis to tax planning, can be mapped to decision problems expressed in natural language, wherein a model must make a binary choice based on user features. Large-scale domains such as legal codes or frequently updated funding opportunities render human annotation (e.g., web forms or decision trees) impractical, highlighting the need for agents that can automatically assist in decision-making. Since relevant information is often only known to the user, it is crucial that these agents ask the right questions. As agents determine when to terminate a conversation, they face a trade-off between accuracy and the number of questions asked, a key metric for both user experience and cost. To evaluate this task, we propose BeNYfits, a new benchmark for determining user eligibility for multiple overlapping social benefits opportunities through interactive decision-making. Our experiments show that current language models struggle with frequent hallucinations, with GPT-4o scoring only 35.7 F1 using a ReAct-style chain-of-thought. To address this, we introduce ProADA, a novel approach that leverages program synthesis to assist in decision-making by mapping dialog planning to a code generation problem and using gaps in structured data to determine the best next action. Our agent, ProADA, improves the F1 score to 55.6 while maintaining nearly the same number of dialog turns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Multi-Language Probabilistic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19538v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>There are many different probabilistic programming languages that are specialized to specific kinds of probabilistic programs. From a usability and scalability perspective, this is undesirable: today, probabilistic programmers are forced up-front to decide which language they want to use and cannot mix-and-match different languages for handling heterogeneous programs. To rectify this, we seek a foundation for sound interoperability for probabilistic programming languages: just as today's Python programmers can resort to low-level C programming for performance, we argue that probabilistic programmers should be able to freely mix different languages for meeting the demands of heterogeneous probabilistic programming environments. As a first step towards this goal, we introduce \textsc{MultiPPL}, a probabilistic multi-language that enables programmers to interoperate between two different probabilistic programming languages: one that leverages a high-performance exact discrete inference strategy, and one that uses approximate importance sampling. We give a syntax and semantics for \textsc{MultiPPL}, prove soundness of its inference algorithm, and provide empirical evidence that it enables programmers to perform inference on complex heterogeneous probabilistic programs and flexibly exploits the strengths and weaknesses of two languages simultaneously.%</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at OOPSLA 2025 (R1)</p></details> |
| **[Verde: Verification via Refereed Delegation for Machine Learning Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19405v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning programs, such as those performing inference, fine-tuning, and training of LLMs, are commonly delegated to untrusted compute providers. To provide correctness guarantees for the client, we propose adapting the cryptographic notion of refereed delegation to the machine learning setting. This approach enables a computationally limited client to delegate a program to multiple untrusted compute providers, with a guarantee of obtaining the correct result if at least one of them is honest. Refereed delegation of ML programs poses two technical hurdles: (1) an arbitration protocol to resolve disputes when compute providers disagree on the output, and (2) the ability to bitwise reproduce ML programs across different hardware setups, For (1), we design Verde, a dispute arbitration protocol that efficiently handles the large scale and graph-based computational model of modern ML programs. For (2), we build RepOps (Reproducible Operators), a library that eliminates hardware "non-determinism" by controlling the order of floating point operations performed on all hardware. Our implementation shows that refereed delegation achieves both strong guarantees for clients and practical overheads for compute providers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Foundations for Deductive Verification of Continuous Probabilistic Programs: From Lebesgue to Riemann and Back](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19388v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We lay out novel foundations for the computer-aided verification of guaranteed bounds on expected outcomes of imperative probabilistic programs featuring (i) general loops, (ii) continuous distributions, and (iii) conditioning. To handle loops we rely on user-provided quantitative invariants, as is well established. However, in the realm of continuous distributions, invariant verification becomes extremely challenging due to the presence of integrals in expectation-based program semantics. Our key idea is to soundly under- or over-approximate these integrals via Riemann sums. We show that this approach enables the SMT-based invariant verification for programs with a fairly general control flow structure. On the theoretical side, we prove convergence of our Riemann approximations, and establish coRE-completeness of the central verification problems. On the practical side, we show that our approach enables to use existing automated verifiers targeting discrete probabilistic programs for the verification of programs involving continuous sampling. Towards this end, we implement our approach in the recent quantitative verification infrastructure Caesar by encoding Riemann sums in its intermediate verification language. We present several promising case studies.</p></details> | <details><summary>Full ...</summary><p>Full version of OOPSLA 25 paper, 55 pages</p></details> |

To achieve increasingly more responsive behaviors upon interactions without relying on centralized computation, embodying memory directly in the machines' structure is crucial. Here, we harness the bistability of elastic shells to alter the fluidic properties of an enclosed cavity, thereby switching between stable frequency states of a locomoting self-oscillating machine. To program these memory states upon interactions, we develop fluidic circuits surrounding the bistable shell, with soft tubes that kink and unkink when externally touched. We implement circuits for both long-term and short-term memory in a soft machine that switches behaviors in response to a human user and that autonomously changes direction after detecting a wall. By harnessing only geometry and elasticity, embodying memory allows physical structures without a central brain to exhibit autonomous feats that are typically reserved for computer-based robotic systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[DBox: Scaffolding Algorithmic Programming Learning through Learner-LLM Co-Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19133v1)** | 2025-02-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Decomposition is a fundamental skill in algorithmic programming, requiring learners to break down complex problems into smaller, manageable parts. However, current self-study methods, such as browsing reference solutions or using LLM assistants, often provide excessive or generic assistance that misaligns with learners' decomposition strategies, hindering independent problem-solving and critical thinking. To address this, we introduce Decomposition Box (DBox), an interactive LLM-based system that scaffolds and adapts to learners' personalized construction of a step tree through a "learner-LLM co-decomposition" approach, providing tailored support at an appropriate level. A within-subjects study (N=24) found that compared to the baseline, DBox significantly improved learning gains, cognitive engagement, and critical thinking. Learners also reported a stronger sense of achievement and found the assistance appropriate and helpful for learning. Additionally, we examined DBox's impact on cognitive load, identified usage patterns, and analyzed learners' strategies for managing system errors. We conclude with design implications for future AI-powered tools to better support algorithmic programming education.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Better Understanding of Program-of-Thought Reasoning in Cross-Lingual and Multilingual Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17956v1)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-step reasoning is essential for large language models (LLMs), yet multilingual performance remains challenging. While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning, it struggles with non-English languages due to the entanglement of reasoning and execution. Program-of-Thought (PoT) prompting separates reasoning from execution, offering a promising alternative but shifting the challenge to generating programs from non-English questions. We propose a framework to evaluate PoT by separating multilingual reasoning from code execution to examine (i) the impact of fine-tuning on question-reasoning alignment and (ii) how reasoning quality affects answer correctness. Our findings demonstrate that PoT fine-tuning substantially enhances multilingual reasoning, outperforming CoT fine-tuned models. We further demonstrate a strong correlation between reasoning quality (measured through code quality) and answer accuracy, highlighting its potential as a test-time performance improvement heuristic.</p></details> |  |
| **[The AI Definition and a Program Which Satisfies this Definition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2212.03184v2)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We will consider all policies of the agent and will prove that one of them is the best performing policy. While that policy is not computable, computable policies do exist in its proximity. We will define AI as a computable policy which is sufficiently proximal to the best performing policy. Before we can define the agent's best performing policy, we need a language for description of the world. We will also use this language to develop a program which satisfies the AI definition. The program will first understand the world by describing it in the selected language. The program will then use the description in order to predict the future and select the best possible move. While this program is extremely inefficient and practically unusable, it can be improved by refining both the language for description of the world and the algorithm used to predict the future. This can yield a program which is both efficient and consistent with the AI definition.</p></details> |  |
| **[SpecGen: Automated Generation of Formal Program Specifications via Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.08807v5)** | 2025-02-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Formal program specifications play a crucial role in various stages of software development. However, manually crafting formal program specifications is rather difficult, making the job time-consuming and labor-intensive. It is even more challenging to write specifications that correctly and comprehensively describe the semantics of complex programs. To reduce the burden on software developers, automated specification generation methods have emerged. However, existing methods usually rely on predefined templates or grammar, making them struggle to accurately describe the behavior and functionality of complex real-world programs. To tackle this challenge, we introduce SpecGen, a novel technique for formal program specification generation based on Large Language Models. Our key insight is to overcome the limitations of existing methods by leveraging the code comprehension capability of LLMs. The process of SpecGen consists of two phases. The first phase employs a conversational approach that guides the LLM to generate appropriate specifications for a given program. The second phase, designed for where the LLM fails to generate correct specifications, applies four mutation operators to the model-generated specifications and selects verifiable specifications from the mutated ones through a novel heuristic selection strategy. We evaluate SpecGen on two datasets, including the SV-COMP Java category benchmark and a manually constructed dataset. Experimental results demonstrate that SpecGen succeeds in generating verifiable specifications for 279 out of 385 programs, outperforming the existing purely LLM-based approaches and conventional specification generation tools like Houdini and Daikon. Further investigations on the quality of generated specifications indicate that SpecGen can comprehensively articulate the behaviors of the input program.</p></details> |  |

Collaborative programming emerges as an effective method for instructors to support novice students in developing coding and teamwork abilities. However, due to limited class time and attention, instructors face challenges in monitoring and evaluating the progress and performance of groups or individuals. To address this issue, we collect multimodal data from real-world settings and develop CPVis, an interactive visual analytics system designed to assess student collaboration dynamically. Specifically, CPVis enables instructors to evaluate both group and individual performance efficiently. CPVis employs a novel flower-based visual encoding to represent performance and provides time-based views to capture the evolution of collaborative behaviors. A within-subject experiment (N=22), comparing CPVis with two baseline systems, reveals that users gain more insights, find the visualization more intuitive, and report increased confidence in their assessments of collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Programming with Pixels: Computer-Use Meets Software Engineering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18525v1)** | 2025-02-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in software engineering (SWE) agents have largely followed a $\textit{tool-based paradigm}$, where agents interact with hand-engineered tool APIs to perform specific tasks. While effective for specialized tasks, these methods fundamentally lack generalization, as they require predefined tools for each task and do not scale across programming languages and domains. We introduce $\texttt{Programming with Pixels}$ (PwP), an agent environment that unifies software development tasks by enabling $\textit{computer-use agents}$-agents that operate directly within an IDE through visual perception, typing, and clicking, rather than relying on predefined tool APIs. To systematically evaluate these agents, we propose $\texttt{PwP-Bench}$, a benchmark that unifies existing SWE benchmarks spanning tasks across multiple programming languages, modalities, and domains under a task-agnostic state and action space. Our experiments demonstrate that general-purpose computer-use agents can approach or even surpass specialized tool-based agents on a variety of SWE tasks without the need for hand-engineered tools. However, our analysis shows that current models suffer from limited visual grounding and fail to exploit many IDE tools that could simplify their tasks. When agents can directly access IDE tools, without visual interaction, they show significant performance improvements, highlighting the untapped potential of leveraging built-in IDE capabilities. Our results establish PwP as a scalable testbed for building and evaluating the next wave of software engineering agents. We release code and data at https://programmingwithpixels.com</p></details> |  |

As large language models that can generate code have become widely available, scientists may increasingly use these models during research software development. We investigate the characteristics of scientists who are early-adopters of code generating models and conduct interviews with scientists at a public, research-focused university. Through interviews and reviews of user interaction logs, we see that scientists often use code generating models as an information retrieval tool for navigating unfamiliar programming languages and libraries. We present findings about their verification strategies and discuss potential vulnerabilities that may emerge from code generation practices unknowingly influencing the parameters of scientific analyses.</p></details> | Accepted to CHI 2025 |

To further enhance this accessibility, recent research has focused on generating VPL code from user instructions using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, by employing prompting-based methods, these studies have shown promising results. Nevertheless, such approaches can be less effective for industrial VPLs such as Ladder Diagram (LD). LD is a pivotal language used in industrial automation processes and involves extensive domain-specific configurations, which are difficult to capture in a single prompt. In this work, we demonstrate that training-based methods outperform prompting-based methods for LD generation accuracy, even with smaller backbone models. Building on these findings, we propose a two-stage training strategy to further enhance VPL generation. First, we employ retrieval-augmented fine-tuning to leverage the repetitive use of subroutines commonly seen in industrial VPLs. Second, we apply direct preference optimization (DPO) to further guide the model toward accurate outputs, using systematically generated preference pairs through graph editing operations. Extensive experiments on real-world LD data demonstrate that our approach improves program-level accuracy by over 10% compared to supervised fine-tuning, which highlights its potential to advance industrial automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor Network Structure Search Using Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02711v2)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor networks provide a powerful framework for compressing multi-dimensional data. The optimal tensor network structure for a given data tensor depends on both the inherent data properties and the specific optimality criteria, making tensor network structure search a crucial research problem. Existing solutions typically involve sampling and validating numerous candidate structures; this is computationally expensive, limiting their practical applications. We address this challenge by formulating tensor network structure search as a program synthesis problem and proposing a highly efficient validation method that is based on constraint solving. Specifically, we design a domain specific language: it builds the correspondence between programs and network structures, and uses a novel idea of output-directed splits to compress the search space without hindering the expressiveness. We then propose a synthesis algorithm that can prioritize promising candidates through constraint solving. % Experimental results show that our approach improves search speed by $10\times$ and achieves compression ratios by $1.5\times$ to $3\times$ better than state-of-the-art. Notably, our approach scales to larger tensors that are out of reach by prior work. Finally, we demonstrate that the discovered topologies generalize to data from the same source, achieving compression ratios up to $ 2.4\times$ better than hierarchical Tuckers while maintaining the runtime around $110$ seconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[A strictly predefined-time convergent and anti-noise fractional-order zeroing neural network for solving time-variant quadratic programming in kinematic robot control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.01857v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper proposes a strictly predefined-time convergent and anti-noise fractional-order zeroing neural network (SPTC-AN-FOZNN) model, meticulously designed for addressing time-variant quadratic programming (TVQP) problems. This model marks the first variable-gain ZNN to collectively manifest strictly predefined-time convergence and noise resilience, specifically tailored for kinematic motion control of robots. The SPTC-AN-FOZNN advances traditional ZNNs by incorporating a conformable fractional derivative in accordance with the Leibniz rule, a compliance not commonly achieved by other fractional derivative definitions. It also features a novel activation function designed to ensure favorable convergence independent of the model's order. When compared to five recently published recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the SPTC-AN-FOZNN, configured with $0<\alpha\leq 1$, exhibits superior positional accuracy and robustness against additive noises for TVQP applications. Extensive empirical evaluations, including simulations with two types of robotic manipulators and experiments with a Flexiv Rizon robot, have validated the SPTC-AN-FOZNN's effectiveness in precise tracking and computational efficiency, establishing its utility for robust kinematic control.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 pa...</summary><p>13 pages, 10 figures; as accepted for publication</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Reason About Program Semantics? A Comprehensive Evaluation of LLMs on Formal Specification Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04779v1)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to automate programming tasks. Yet, LLMs' capabilities in reasoning about program semantics are still inadequately studied, leaving significant potential for further exploration. This paper introduces FormalBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities on program semantics, particularly via the task of synthesizing formal program specifications to assist verifying program correctness. This task requires both comprehensive reasoning over all possible program executions (i.e., \textit{completeness}) and the generation of precise, syntactically correct expressions that adhere to formal syntax and semantics (i.e., \textit{consistency}). Using this benchmark, we evaluated the ability of LLMs in synthesizing consistent and complete specifications. Our findings show that LLMs perform well with simple control flows but struggle with more complex structures, especially loops, even with advanced prompting. Additionally, LLMs exhibit limited robustness against semantic-preserving transformations. We also highlight common failure patterns and design self-repair prompts, improving success rates by 25%.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Stepwise Distillation Learning Strategy for Non-differentiable Visual Programming Frameworks on Visual Reasoning Tasks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2309.09809v3)** | 2025-02-22 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Visual Programming (VProg) has emerged as a significant framework for visual reasoning (VR) tasks due to its interpretability and cross-task generality. However, even with invoking powerful pre-trained Vision-Language models (VLMs) as visual sub-modules, the performance of VProg on specific VR tasks is markedly inferior compared to well-trained task-specific networks. Although invoking task-specific models can further enhance the performance of VProg on specific VR tasks, it greatly diminishes the cross-task generalization ability of VProg. Besides, the non-differentiable nature of VProg prevents direct fine-tuning on specific VR tasks for further performance improvement. Attempt to address these issues, we propose SDVP, a Stepwise Distillation learning strategy for non-differentiable VPorg across various VR tasks. Specifically, our SDVP stepwise distills the capabilities of existing, well-trained small task-specific models for decomposed visual sub-tasks in VProg into the much larger VLMs invoked by corresponding visual sub-modules. Besides, distilling the knowledge of little-size task-specific models into pre-trained larger VLMs rather than replacing them helps keep the cross-task abilities of VProgs. Extensive and comprehensive experimental results on different VProg frameworks demonstrate that our SDVP obtains significant performance gains on specific VR benchmarks, i.e., GQA (+2.4\%) and NLVRv2 (+6.2\%) for VisProg and GQA (+6.5\%) and NLVRv2 (+4.0\%) for ViperGPT, and also maintains a promising performance for VProg on unseen and previous VR tasks.</p></details> |  |

We construct hypothesis tests based on semidefinite programming and with a statistic coming from a GOE matrix to distinguish between any two candidate numbers of communities. This is possible due to a universality result for a semidefinite programming-based function that we also prove.

Furthermore, we also construct estimators of the communities themselves.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is a first draft. Comments are welcome</p></details> |
| **[Towards Foundation Models for Mixed Integer Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.08288v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP) is essential for modeling complex decision-making problems but faces challenges in computational tractability and requires expert formulation. Current deep learning approaches for MILP focus on specific problem classes and do not generalize to unseen classes. To address this shortcoming, we take a foundation model training approach, where we train a single deep learning model on a diverse set of MILP problems to generalize across problem classes. As existing datasets for MILP lack diversity and volume, we introduce MILP-Evolve, a novel LLM-based evolutionary framework that is capable of generating a large set of diverse MILP classes with an unlimited amount of instances. We study our methodology on three key learning tasks that capture diverse aspects of MILP: (1) integrality gap prediction, (2) learning to branch, and (3) a new task of aligning MILP instances with natural language descriptions. Our empirical results show that models trained on the data generated by MILP-Evolve achieve significant improvements on unseen problems, including MIPLIB benchmarks. Our work highlights the potential of moving towards a foundation model approach for MILP that can generalize to a broad range of MILP applications. Our code and data are publicly available at https://github.com/microsoft/OptiGuide.</p></details> |  |

This progress sets the stage for Beyond 5G (B5G) networks, which present new complexity and performance requirements challenges. Linear Programming (LP), Integer Linear Programming (ILP), and Mixed-Integer Linear Programming (MILP) models have been widely used to model the optimization of resource allocation problems in networks. This paper reviews 103 studies on resource allocation strategies in 5G and B5G, focusing specifically on optimization problems modelled as LP, ILP, and MILP. The selected studies are categorized based on network architectures, types of resource allocation problems, and specific objective functions and constraints. The review also discusses solution methods for NP-hard ILP and MILP problems by categorizing the solution methods into different categories. Additionally, emerging trends, such as integrating AI and machine learning with optimization models, are explored, suggesting promising future research directions in network optimization. The paper concludes that LP, ILP, and MILP models have been widely adopted across various network architectures, resource types, objective functions, and constraints and remain critical to optimizing next-generation networks.</p></details> |  |

| **[How Do Programming Students Use Generative AI?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.10091v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Programming students have a widespread access to powerful Generative AI tools like ChatGPT. While this can help understand the learning material and assist with exercises, educators are voicing more and more concerns about an overreliance on generated outputs and lack of critical thinking skills. It is thus important to understand how students actually use generative AI and what impact this could have on their learning behavior. To this end, we conducted a study including an exploratory experiment with 37 programming students, giving them monitored access to ChatGPT while solving a code authoring exercise. The task was not directly solvable by ChatGPT and required code comprehension and reasoning. While only 23 of the students actually opted to use the chatbot, the majority of those eventually prompted it to simply generate a full solution. We observed two prevalent usage strategies: to seek knowledge about general concepts and to directly generate solutions. Instead of using the bot to comprehend the code and their own mistakes, students often got trapped in a vicious cycle of submitting wrong generated code and then asking the bot for a fix. Those who self-reported using generative AI regularly were more likely to prompt the bot to generate a solution. Our findings indicate that concerns about potential decrease in programmers' agency and productivity with Generative AI are justified. We discuss how researchers and educators can respond to the potential risk of students uncritically over-relying on Generative AI. We also discuss potential modifications to our study design for large-scale replications.</p></details> | <details><summary>prepr...</summary><p>preprint; accepted to ACM International Conference on the Foundations of Software Engineering (FSE) 2025</p></details> |
| **[A fast convergence algorithm based on binary integer programming for expert load balancing in MoE LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15451v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>MoE (Mixture-of-Expert) architectures appear frequently in large language models, and the number of experts can be over one hundred recently. However, the expert load imbalance problem always happens in MoE model pre-training, which will cause routing collapse or increased computational overhead. In order to balance loads on experts, we propose BIP-Based Balancing, an expert load balancing algorithm based on binary integer programming (BIP). The algorithm maintains an additional vector q that can help change the top-K order of s by solving a binary integer programming with very small time costs. In simulation experiments, we observe that BIP-Based Balancing make imbalance disappoint very fast, while the final sum of routine scores decreases very little. Our algorithm achieves nearly perfect trade-off between expert load balance and pre-training efficiency under the simulation view.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quantum Markov Decision Processes: Dynamic and Semi-Definite Programs for Optimal Solutions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.14651v2)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, building on the formulation of quantum Markov decision processes (q-MDPs) presented in our previous work [{\sc N.~Saldi, S.~Sanjari, and S.~Y\"{u}ksel}, {\em Quantum Markov Decision Processes: General Theory, Approximations, and Classes of Policies}, SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization, 2024], our focus shifts to the development of semi-definite programming approaches for optimal policies and value functions of both open-loop and classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies. First, by using the duality between the dynamic programming and the semi-definite programming formulations of any q-MDP with open-loop policies, we establish that the optimal value function is linear and there exists a stationary optimal policy among open-loop policies. Then, using these results, we establish a method for computing an approximately optimal value function and formulate computation of optimal stationary open-loop policy as a bi-linear program. Next, we turn our attention to classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies. Dynamic programming and semi-definite programming formulations for classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies are established, where duality of these two formulations similarly enables us to prove that the optimal policy is linear and there exists an optimal stationary classical-state-preserving closed-loop policy. Then, similar to the open-loop case, we establish a method for computing the optimal value function and pose computation of optimal stationary classical-state-preserving closed-loop policies as a bi-linear program.</p></details> | 53 pages |
| **[Computation Tree Logic Guided Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.15344v1)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Temporal logics like Computation Tree Logic (CTL) have been widely used as expressive formalisms to capture rich behavioral specifications. CTL can express properties such as reachability, termination, invariants and responsiveness, which are difficult to test. This paper suggests a mechanism for the automated repair of infinite-state programs guided by CTL properties. Our produced patches avoid the overfitting issue that occurs in test-suite-guided repair, where the repaired code may not pass tests outside the given test suite. To realize this vision, we propose a repair framework based on Datalog, a widely used domain-specific language for program analysis, which readily supports nested fixed-point semantics of CTL via stratified negation. Specifically, our framework encodes the program and CTL properties into Datalog facts and rules and performs the repair by modifying the facts to pass the analysis rules. Previous research proposed a generic repair mechanism for Datalog-based analysis in the form of Symbolic Execution of Datalog (SEDL). However, SEDL only supports positive Datalog, which is insufficient for expressing CTL properties. Thus, we extended SEDL to make it applicable to stratified Datalog. Moreover, liveness property violations involve infinite computations, which we handle via a novel loop summarization. Our approach achieves analysis accuracy of 56.6% on a small-scale benchmark and 88.5% on a real-world benchmark, outperforming the best baseline performances of 27.7% and 76.9%. Our approach repairs all detected bugs, which is not achieved by existing tools.</p></details> |  |
| **[Safe Pareto Improvements for Expected Utility Maximizers in Program Games](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.05103v5)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agents in mixed-motive coordination problems such as Chicken may fail to coordinate on a Pareto-efficient outcome. Safe Pareto improvements (SPIs) were originally proposed to mitigate miscoordination in cases where players lack probabilistic beliefs as to how their delegates will play a game; delegates are instructed to behave so as to guarantee a Pareto improvement on how they would play by default. More generally, SPIs may be defined as transformations of strategy profiles such that all players are necessarily better off under the transformed profile. In this work, we investigate the extent to which SPIs can reduce downsides of miscoordination between expected utility-maximizing agents. We consider games in which players submit computer programs that can condition their decisions on each other's code, and use this property to construct SPIs using programs capable of renegotiation. We first show that under mild conditions on players' beliefs, each player always prefers to use renegotiation. Next, we show that under similar assumptions, each player always prefers to be willing to renegotiate at least to the point at which they receive the lowest payoff they can attain in any efficient outcome. Thus subjectively optimal play guarantees players at least these payoffs, without the need for coordination on specific Pareto improvements. Lastly, we prove that renegotiation does not guarantee players any improvements on this bound.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to the 24th International Conference on Autonomous Agents and Multiagent Systems (AAMAS-25)</p></details> |
| **[Aligning the Objective of LLM-based Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.08877v5)** | 2025-02-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved decent results on automated program repair (APR). However, the next token prediction training objective of decoder-only LLMs (e.g., GPT-4) is misaligned with the masked span prediction objective of current infilling-style methods, which impedes LLMs from fully leveraging pre-trained knowledge for program repair. In addition, while some LLMs can locate and repair bugs in certain functions using the related artifacts (e.g., test cases), existing methods still depend on statement-level fault localization methods to provide a list of buggy hunks for repair. This restriction hinders LLMs from exploring potential patches beyond the given locations. In this paper, we investigate a new approach to adapt LLMs to program repair. Our core insight is that LLM's APR capability can be greatly improved by simply aligning the output to their training objective and allowing them to refine the whole program without first identifying faulty statements. Based on this insight, we designed D4C, a straightforward prompting framework for APR. D4C can repair 180 bugs correctly in Defects4J, with each patch being sampled only 10 times. This surpasses the SOTA APR methods with perfect fault localization by 10% and reduces the patch sampling number by 90%. Our findings reveal that (1) objective alignment is crucial for fully exploiting LLM's pre-trained capability, and (2) replacing the traditional localize-buggy-hunks-then-repair workflow with direct debugging is more effective for LLM-based APR methods. Thus, we believe this paper introduces a new mindset for harnessing LLMs in APR.</p></details> | Accepted by ICSE'25 |
| **[Towards Secure Program Partitioning for Smart Contracts with LLM's In-Context Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14215v1)** | 2025-02-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Smart contracts are highly susceptible to manipulation attacks due to the leakage of sensitive information. Addressing manipulation vulnerabilities is particularly challenging because they stem from inherent data confidentiality issues rather than straightforward implementation bugs. To tackle this by preventing sensitive information leakage, we present PartitionGPT, the first LLM-driven approach that combines static analysis with the in-context learning capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to partition smart contracts into privileged and normal codebases, guided by a few annotated sensitive data variables. We evaluated PartitionGPT on 18 annotated smart contracts containing 99 sensitive functions. The results demonstrate that PartitionGPT successfully generates compilable, and verified partitions for 78% of the sensitive functions while reducing approximately 30% code compared to function-level partitioning approach. Furthermore, we evaluated PartitionGPT on nine real-world manipulation attacks that lead to a total loss of 25 million dollars, PartitionGPT effectively prevents eight cases, highlighting its potential for broad applicability and the necessity for secure program partitioning during smart contract development to diminish manipulation vulnerabilities.</p></details> |  |
| **[Autellix: An Efficient Serving Engine for LLM Agents as General Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13965v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) applications are evolving beyond simple chatbots into dynamic, general-purpose agentic programs, which scale LLM calls and output tokens to help AI agents reason, explore, and solve complex tasks. However, existing LLM serving systems ignore dependencies between programs and calls, missing significant opportunities for optimization. Our analysis reveals that programs submitted to LLM serving engines experience long cumulative wait times, primarily due to head-of-line blocking at both the individual LLM request and the program. To address this, we introduce Autellix, an LLM serving system that treats programs as first-class citizens to minimize their end-to-end latencies. Autellix intercepts LLM calls submitted by programs, enriching schedulers with program-level context. We propose two scheduling algorithms-for single-threaded and distributed programs-that preempt and prioritize LLM calls based on their programs' previously completed calls. Our evaluation demonstrates that across diverse LLMs and agentic workloads, Autellix improves throughput of programs by 4-15x at the same latency compared to state-of-the-art systems, such as vLLM.</p></details> |  |

The recent trend toward LLM agents offers a path toward integrating the power of LLMs to create new code with the power of analysis tools to increase trust in the code.

| **[AutoTEE: Automated Migration and Protection of Programs in Trusted Execution Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.13379v1)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) isolate a special space within a device's memory that is not accessible to the normal world (also known as Untrusted Environment), even when the device is compromised. Thus, developers can utilize TEEs to provide strong security guarantees for their programs, making sensitive operations like encrypted data storage, fingerprint verification, and remote attestation protected from malicious attacks. Despite the strong protections offered by TEEs, adapting existing programs to leverage such security guarantees is non-trivial, often requiring extensive domain knowledge and manual intervention, which makes TEEs less accessible to developers. This motivates us to design AutoTEE, the first Large Language Model (LLM)-enabled approach that can automatically identify, partition, transform, and port sensitive functions into TEEs with minimal developer intervention. By manually reviewing 68 repositories, we constructed a benchmark dataset consisting of 385 sensitive functions eligible for transformation, on which AutoTEE achieves a high F1 score of 0.91. AutoTEE effectively transforms these sensitive functions into their TEE-compatible counterparts, achieving success rates of 90\% and 83\% for Java and Python, respectively. We further provide a mechanism to automatically port the transformed code to different TEE platforms, including Intel SGX and AMD SEV, demonstrating that the transformed programs run successfully and correctly on these platforms.</p></details> | 14 pages |
| **[Template-Based Visual Program Distillation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08564v2)** | 2025-02-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For users with limited computational resources, visual programming or prompting large language models (LLMs) to generate executable code for visual tasks, like visual question answering (VQA), remains largely inaccessible. Even with techniques such as distillation, adapting visual programming to smaller models or specific datasets is still quite challenging due to high annotation costs. We propose a low-cost visual program distillation method that can be used for models with fewer than 1 billion parameters and requires no human-generated program annotations. We achieve this through synthetic data augmentation based on decoupling programs into higher-level skills, called templates, and their corresponding arguments. Experimental results show that, with a relatively small amount of question/answer data, small language models can generate high-quality visual programs with the added benefit of much faster inference.</p></details> |  |
