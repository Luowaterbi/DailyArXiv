| **[A Causal Perspective on Measuring, Explaining and Mitigating Smells in LLM-Generated Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15817v4)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated their adoption in software engineering contexts. However, concerns persist about the structural quality of the code they produce. In particular, LLMs often replicate poor coding practices, introducing code smells (i.e., patterns that hinder readability, maintainability, or design integrity). Although prior research has examined the detection or repair of smells, we still lack a clear understanding of how and when these issues emerge in generated code. This paper addresses this gap by systematically measuring, explaining and mitigating smell propensity in LLM-generated code. We build on the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), a probabilistic metric that estimates the likelihood of generating particular smell types, and establish its robustness as a signal of structural quality. Using PSC as an instrument for causal analysis, we identify how generation strategy, model size, model architecture and prompt formulation shape the structural properties of generated code. Our findings show that prompt design and architectural choices play a decisive role in smell propensity and motivate practical mitigation strategies that reduce its occurrence. A user study further demonstrates that PSC helps developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality, providing evidence that smell propensity signals can support human judgement. Taken together, our work lays the groundwork for integrating quality-aware assessments into the evaluation and deployment of LLMs for code.</p></details> |  |

However, still very few cases are known and the explicit construction of such codes is a challenging problem. Here we show that a Griesmer type bound for the length of additive codes can always be attained with equality if the minimum distance is sufficiently large. This solves the problem for the optimal parameters of additive codes when the minimum distance is large and yields many infinite series of additive codes that outperform linear codes.</p></details> | <details><summary>181 p...</summary><p>181 pages, 27 tables, typos removed, content extended; comments more than welcome</p></details> |
| **[SGCR: A Specification-Grounded Framework for Trustworthy LLM Code Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17540v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating code review with Large Language Models (LLMs) shows immense promise, yet practical adoption is hampered by their lack of reliability, context-awareness, and control. To address this, we propose Specification-Grounded Code Review (SGCR), a framework that grounds LLMs in human-authored specifications to produce trustworthy and relevant feedback. SGCR features a novel dual-pathway architecture: an explicit path ensures deterministic compliance with predefined rules derived from these specifications, while an implicit path heuristically discovers and verifies issues beyond those rules. Deployed in a live industrial environment at HiThink Research, SGCR's suggestions achieved a 42% developer adoption rate-a 90.9% relative improvement over a baseline LLM (22%). Our work demonstrates that specification-grounding is a powerful paradigm for bridging the gap between the generative power of LLMs and the rigorous reliability demands of software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[Voxel-GS: Quantized Scaffold Gaussian Splatting Compression with Run-Length Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17528v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Substantial Gaussian splatting format point clouds require effective compression. In this paper, we propose Voxel-GS, a simple yet highly effective framework that departs from the complex neural entropy models of prior work, instead achieving competitive performance using only a lightweight rate proxy and run-length coding. Specifically, we employ a differentiable quantization to discretize the Gaussian attributes of Scaffold-GS. Subsequently, a Laplacian-based rate proxy is devised to impose an entropy constraint, guiding the generation of high-fidelity and compact reconstructions. Finally, this integer-type Gaussian point cloud is compressed losslessly using Octree and run-length coding. Experiments validate that the proposed rate proxy accurately estimates the bitrate of run-length coding, enabling Voxel-GS to eliminate redundancy and optimize for a more compact representation. Consequently, our method achieves a remarkable compression ratio with significantly faster coding speeds than prior art. The code is available at https://github.com/zb12138/VoxelGS.</p></details> | Accepted by DCC 2026 |
| **[CIFE: Code Instruction-Following Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17387v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to real-world code generation, where functional correctness alone is insufficient for reliable deployment, developers also expect adherence to explicit requirements for robustness, formatting, and security. Existing benchmarks primarily assess correctness through test-case execution, offering limited insight into how reliably models follow such constraints. We introduce a benchmark of 1,000 Python tasks, each paired with an average of 7 developer-specified constraints spanning 13 categories. Constraints are curated through a four-stage human-LLM pipeline to ensure they are atomic, relevant, and objective. We evaluate 14 open- and closed-source models using complementary adherence metrics and propose the C2A Score, a composite measure that jointly captures correctness and constraint compliance. Results reveal a substantial gap between partial and strict satisfaction, while strong models achieve over 90% partial adherence, strict adherence remains between 39-66%. These findings highlight that trustworthy code generation requires not only correctness but also consistent adherence to developer intent.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 22 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[UCoder: Unsupervised Code Generation by Internal Probing of Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17385v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in code generation tasks. However, their effectiveness heavily relies on supervised training with extensive labeled (e.g., question-answering pairs) or unlabeled datasets (e.g., code snippets), which are often expensive and difficult to obtain at scale. To address this limitation, this paper introduces a method IPC, an unsupervised framework that leverages Internal Probing of LLMs for Code generation without any external corpus, even unlabeled code snippets. We introduce the problem space probing, test understanding probing, solution space probing, and knowledge consolidation and reinforcement to probe the internal knowledge and confidence patterns existing in LLMs. Further, IPC identifies reliable code candidates through self-consistency mechanisms and representation-based quality estimation to train UCoder (coder with unsupervised learning). We validate the proposed approach across multiple code benchmarks, demonstrating that unsupervised methods can achieve competitive performance compared to supervised approaches while significantly reducing the dependency on labeled data and computational resources. Analytic experiments reveal that internal model states contain rich signals about code quality and correctness, and that properly harnessing these signals enables effective unsupervised learning for code generation tasks, opening new directions for training code LLMs in resource-constrained scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphCue for SDN Configuration Code Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17371v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present GraphCue, a topology-grounded retrieval and agent-in-the-loop framework for automated SDN configuration. Each case is abstracted into a JSON graph and embedded using a lightweight three-layer GCN trained with contrastive learning. The nearest validated reference is injected into a structured prompt that constrains code generation, while a verifier closes the loop by executing the candidate configuration and feeding failures back to the agent. On 628 validation cases, GraphCue achieves an 88.2 percent pass rate within 20 iterations and completes 95 percent of verification loops within 9 seconds. Ablation studies without retrieval or structured prompting perform substantially worse, indicating that topology-aware retrieval and constraint-based conditioning are key drivers of performance.</p></details> | 2 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Cryptanalysis of Pseudorandom Error-Correcting Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17310v1)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pseudorandom error-correcting codes (PRC) is a novel cryptographic primitive proposed at CRYPTO 2024. Due to the dual capability of pseudorandomness and error correction, PRC has been recognized as a promising foundational component for watermarking AI-generated content. However, the security of PRC has not been thoroughly analyzed, especially with concrete parameters or even in the face of cryptographic attacks. To fill this gap, we present the first cryptanalysis of PRC. We first propose three attacks to challenge the undetectability and robustness assumptions of PRC. Among them, two attacks aim to distinguish PRC-based codewords from plain vectors, and one attack aims to compromise the decoding process of PRC. Our attacks successfully undermine the claimed security guarantees across all parameter configurations. Notably, our attack can detect the presence of a watermark with overwhelming probability at a cost of $2^{22}$ operations. We also validate our approach by attacking real-world large generative models such as DeepSeek and Stable Diffusion. To mitigate our attacks, we further propose three defenses to enhance the security of PRC, including parameter suggestions, implementation suggestions, and constructing a revised key generation algorithm. Our proposed revised key generation function effectively prevents the occurrence of weak keys. However, we highlight that the current PRC-based watermarking scheme still cannot achieve a 128-bit security under our parameter suggestions due to the inherent configurations of large generative models, such as the maximum output length of large language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding and supporting how developers prompt for LLM-powered code editing in practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.20196v2)** | 2025-12-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are rapidly transforming software engineering, with coding assistants embedded in an IDE becoming increasingly prevalent. While research has focused on improving the tools and understanding developer perceptions, a critical gap exists in understanding how developers actually use these tools in their daily workflows, and, crucially, where they struggle. This paper addresses part of this gap through a multi-phased investigation of developer interactions with an LLM-powered code editing feature, Transform Code, in an IDE widely used at Google. First, we analyze telemetry logs of the feature usage, revealing that frequent re-prompting can be an indicator of developer struggles with using Transform Code. Second, we conduct a qualitative analysis of unsatisfactory requests, identifying five key categories of information often missing from developer prompts. Finally, based on these findings, we propose and evaluate a tool, AutoPrompter, for automatically improving prompts by inferring missing information from the surrounding code context, leading to a 27% improvement in edit correctness on our test set.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hermitian Hulls of Rational Algebraic Geometry Codes and Applications in Quantum Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17128v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Interest in the hulls of linear codes has been growing rapidly. More is known when the inner product is Euclidean than Hermitian. A shift to the latter is gaining traction. The focus is on a code whose Hermitian hull dimension and dual distance can be systematically determined. Such a code can serve as an ingredient in designing the parameters of entanglement-assisted quantum error-correcting codes (EAQECCs). We use tools from algebraic function fields of one variable to efficiently determine a good lower bound on the Hermitian hull dimensions of generalized rational algebraic geometry (AG) codes. We identify families of AG codes whose hull dimensions can be well estimated by a lower bound. Given such a code, the idea is to select a set of evaluation points for which the residues of the Weil differential associated with the Hermitian dual code has an easily verifiable property. The approach allows us to construct codes with designed Hermitian hull dimensions based on known results on Reed-Solomon codes and their generalization. Using the Hermitian method on these maximum distance separable (MDS) codes with designed hull dimensions yields two families of MDS EAQECCs. We confirm that the excellent parameters of the quantum codes from these families are new.</p></details> | 23 pages |
| **[MatchFixAgent: Language-Agnostic Autonomous Repository-Level Code Translation Validation and Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.16187v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation transforms source code from one programming language (PL) to another. Validating the functional equivalence of translation and repairing, if necessary, are critical steps in code translation. Existing automated validation and repair approaches struggle to generalize to many PLs due to high engineering overhead, and they rely on existing and often inadequate test suites, which results in false claims of equivalence and ineffective translation repair. We develop MatchFixAgent, a large language model (LLM)-based, PL-agnostic framework for equivalence validation and repair of translations. MatchFixAgent features a multi-agent architecture that divides equivalence validation into several sub-tasks to ensure thorough and consistent semantic analysis of the translation. Then it feeds this analysis to test agent to write and execute tests. Upon observing a test failure, the repair agent attempts to fix the translation bug. The final (in)equivalence decision is made by the verdict agent, considering semantic analyses and test execution results. We compare MatchFixAgent's validation and repair results with four repository-level code translation techniques. We use 2,219 translation pairs from their artifacts, which cover 6 PL pairs, and are collected from 24 GitHub projects totaling over 900K lines of code. Our results demonstrate that MatchFixAgent produces (in)equivalence verdicts for 99.2% of translation pairs, with the same equivalence validation result as prior work on 72.8% of them. When MatchFixAgent's result disagrees with prior work, we find that 60.7% of the time MatchFixAgent's result is actually correct. In addition, we show that MatchFixAgent can repair 50.6% of inequivalent translation, compared to prior work's 18.5%. This demonstrates that MatchFixAgent is far more adaptable to many PL pairs than prior work, while producing highly accurate validation results.</p></details> |  |
| **[A First Look at the Self-Admitted Technical Debt in Test Code: Taxonomy and Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.22409v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-admitted technical debt (SATD) refers to comments in which developers explicitly acknowledge code issues, workarounds, or suboptimal solutions. SATD is known to significantly increase software maintenance effort. While extensive research has examined SATD in source code, its presence and impact in test code have received no focused attention, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of how SATD manifests in testing contexts. This study, the first of its kind, investigates SATD in test code by manually analyzing 50,000 comments randomly sampled from 1.6 million comments across 1,000 open-source Java projects. From this sample, after manual analysis and filtering, we identified 615 SATD comments and classified them into 14 distinct categories, building a taxonomy of test code SATD. To investigate whether test code SATD can be detected automatically, we evaluated existing SATD detection tools, as well as both open-source and proprietary LLMs. Among the existing tools, MAT performed the best, albeit with moderate recall. To our surprise, both open-source and proprietary LLMs exhibited poor detection accuracy, primarily due to low precision. These results indicate that neither existing approaches nor current LLMs can reliably detect SATD in test code. Overall, this work provides the first large-scale analysis of SATD in test code, a nuanced understanding of its types, and the limitations of current SATD detection methods. Our findings lay the groundwork for future research on test code-specific SATD.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-HPC++: Evaluating LLM-Generated Modern C++ and MPI+OpenMP Codes for Scalable Mandelbrot Set Computation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17023v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Parallel programming remains one of the most challenging aspects of High-Performance Computing (HPC), requiring deep knowledge of synchronization, communication, and memory models. While modern C++ standards and frameworks like OpenMP and MPI have simplified parallelism, mastering these paradigms is still complex. Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating code generation, but their effectiveness in producing correct and efficient HPC code is not well understood. In this work, we systematically evaluate leading LLMs including ChatGPT 4 and 5, Claude, and LLaMA on the task of generating C++ implementations of the Mandelbrot set using shared-memory, directive-based, and distributed-memory paradigms. Each generated program is compiled and executed with GCC 11.5.0 to assess its correctness, robustness, and scalability. Results show that ChatGPT-4 and ChatGPT-5 achieve strong syntactic precision and scalable performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[BigCodeArena: Unveiling More Reliable Human Preferences in Code Generation via Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08697v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Crowdsourced model evaluation platforms, such as Chatbot Arena, enable real-time evaluation from human perspectives to assess the quality of model responses. In the coding domain, manually examining the quality of LLM-generated content is extremely challenging, as it requires understanding long chunks of raw code and deliberately simulating code execution. To this end, we introduce BigCodeArena, an open human evaluation platform for code generation backed by a comprehensive and on-the-fly execution environment. Built on top of Chatbot Arena, BigCodeArena enables the execution of LLM-generated code and allows humans to interact with the execution process and outcomes. We collected over 14,000 raw code-centric conversation sessions across 10 widely used LLMs, spanning 10 languages and 8 types of execution environments. Among these conversations, we identified more than 4,700 multi-turn samples with pairwise human preferences. Further analysis uncovers underexplored preferences of LLMs in fine-grained domains characterized by tasks, languages, and frameworks. To systematically examine code understanding and generation capabilities of frontier LLMs, we curated two benchmarks based on the collected data, namely BigCodeReward and AutoCodeArena. For BigCodeReward, we post-processed the 4,700 conversations and evaluated the consistency between reward models and human preferences. The evaluation shows that most LLMs have superior performance in judging coding preferences when the execution results are available. Inspired by these findings, we propose AutoCodeArena, an automatic Elo rating benchmark designed to assess the coding quality of LLMs without human involvement. We find that proprietary LLMs like GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, and Claude-Opus-4 still lead in code generation performance among recent emerging models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Built...</summary><p>Built with love by the BigCode community :)</p></details> |
| **[Beyond Rate Coding: Surrogate Gradients Enable Spike Timing Learning in Spiking Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.16043v3)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The surrogate gradient descent algorithm enabled spiking neural networks to be trained to carry out challenging sensory processing tasks, an important step in understanding how spikes contribute to neural computations. However, it is unclear the extent to which these algorithms fully explore the space of possible spiking solutions to problems. We investigated whether spiking networks trained with surrogate gradient descent can learn to make use of information that is only encoded in the timing and not the rate of spikes. We constructed synthetic datasets with a range of types of spike timing information (interspike intervals, spatio-temporal spike patterns or polychrony, and coincidence codes). We find that surrogate gradient descent training can extract all of these types of information. In more realistic speech-based datasets, both timing and rate information is present. We therefore constructed variants of these datasets in which all rate information is removed, and find that surrogate gradient descent can still perform well. We tested all networks both with and without trainable axonal delays. We find that delays can give a significant increase in performance, particularly for more challenging tasks. To determine what types of spike timing information are being used by the networks trained on the speech-based tasks, we test these networks on time-reversed spikes which perturb spatio-temporal spike patterns but leave interspike intervals and coincidence information unchanged. We find that when axonal delays are not used, networks perform well under time reversal, whereas networks trained with delays perform poorly. This suggests that spiking neural networks with delays are better able to exploit temporal structure. To facilitate further studies of temporal coding, we have released our modified speech-based datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Systematic Study of Code Obfuscation Against LLM-based Vulnerability Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16538v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) are increasingly adopted for code vulnerability detection, their reliability and robustness across diverse vulnerability types have become a pressing concern. In traditional adversarial settings, code obfuscation has long been used as a general strategy to bypass auditing tools, preserving exploitability without tampering with the tools themselves. Numerous efforts have explored obfuscation methods and tools, yet their capabilities differ in terms of supported techniques, granularity, and programming languages, making it difficult to systematically assess their impact on LLM-based vulnerability detection. To address this gap, we provide a structured systematization of obfuscation techniques and evaluate them under a unified framework. Specifically, we categorize existing obfuscation methods into three major classes (layout, data flow, and control flow) covering 11 subcategories and 19 concrete techniques. We implement these techniques across four programming languages (Solidity, C, C++, and Python) using a consistent LLM-driven approach, and evaluate their effects on 15 LLMs spanning four model families (DeepSeek, OpenAI, Qwen, and LLaMA), as well as on two coding agents (GitHub Copilot and Codex). Our findings reveal both positive and negative impacts of code obfuscation on LLM-based vulnerability detection, highlighting conditions under which obfuscation leads to performance improvements or degradations. We further analyze these outcomes with respect to vulnerability characteristics, code properties, and model attributes. Finally, we outline several open problems and propose future directions to enhance the robustness of LLMs for real-world vulnerability detection.</p></details> |  |

We describe how two different generalized Reed-Solomon codes can be combined to construct one GMCC. We further establish sufficient conditions ensuring that the GMCC are Hermitian self-orthogonal, thus leading to new constructions of quantum codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Vibe Coding as a Reconfiguration of Intent Mediation in Software Development: Definition, Implications, and Research Agenda](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21928v3)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Software development is undergoing a fundamental transformation as vibe coding becomes widespread, with large portions of contemporary codebases now being generated by Artificial Intelligence (AI). The disconnect between rapid adoption and limited conceptual understanding highlights the need for an inquiry into this emerging paradigm. Drawing on an intent perspective and historical analysis, we define vibe coding as a software development paradigm where humans and Generative AI (GenAI) engage in collaborative flow to co-create software artifacts through natural language dialogue, shifting the mediation of developer intent from deterministic instruction to probabilistic inference. By intent mediation, we refer to the fundamental process through which developers translate their conceptual goals into representations that computational systems can execute. Our results show that vibe coding redistributes epistemic labor between humans and machines, shifting expertise from technical implementation toward collaborative orchestration. We identify key opportunities, including democratization, acceleration, and systemic leverage, alongside risks such as black-box codebases, responsibility gaps, and ecosystem bias. We conclude with a research agenda spanning human-, technology-, and organization-centered directions to guide future investigations of this paradigm.</p></details> |  |
| **[AutoDFBench 1.0: A Benchmarking Framework for Digital Forensic Tool Testing and Generated Code Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16965v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Computer Forensic Tool Testing (CFTT) programme has become the de facto standard for providing digital forensic tool testing and validation. However to date, no comprehensive framework exists to automate benchmarking across the diverse forensic tasks included in the programme. This gap results in inconsistent validation, challenges in comparing tools, and limited validation reproducibility. This paper introduces AutoDFBench 1.0, a modular benchmarking framework that supports the evaluation of both conventional DF tools and scripts, as well as AI-generated code and agentic approaches. The framework integrates five areas defined by the CFTT programme: string search, deleted file recovery, file carving, Windows registry recovery, and SQLite data recovery. AutoDFBench 1.0 includes ground truth data comprising of 63 test cases and 10,968 unique test scenarios, and execute evaluations through a RESTful API that produces structured JSON outputs with standardised metrics, including precision, recall, and F1~score for each test case, and the average of these F1~scores becomes the AutoDFBench Score. The benchmarking framework is validated against CFTT's datasets. The framework enables fair and reproducible comparison across tools and forensic scripts, establishing the first unified, automated, and extensible benchmarking framework for digital forensic tool testing and validation. AutoDFBench 1.0 supports tool vendors, researchers, practitioners, and standardisation bodies by facilitating transparent, reproducible, and comparable assessments of DF technologies.</p></details> |  |

In coding theory terms we are dealing with additive codes that have a large $f$th generalized Hamming weight. We also consider the dual problem of the minimum number $b_q(r,h,f;s)$ of $(h-1)$-spaces in $\operatorname{PG}(r-1,q)$ such that each subspace of codimension $f$ contains at least $s$ elements. We fully determine $b_2(5,2,2;s)$ as a function of $s$.

Although naturally complementary, these two information streams are highly heterogeneous in both paradigm and reasoning, making it difficult for existing methods to unify them or effectively model their cross-level interactions. To address this gap, we propose ForenAgent, a multi-round interactive IFD framework that enables MLLMs to autonomously generate, execute, and iteratively refine Python-based low-level tools around the detection objective, thereby achieving more flexible and interpretable forgery analysis. ForenAgent follows a two-stage training pipeline combining Cold Start and Reinforcement Fine-Tuning to enhance its tool interaction capability and reasoning adaptability progressively. Inspired by human reasoning, we design a dynamic reasoning loop comprising global perception, local focusing, iterative probing, and holistic adjudication, and instantiate it as both a data-sampling strategy and a task-aligned process reward. For systematic training and evaluation, we construct FABench, a heterogeneous, high-quality agent-forensics dataset comprising 100k images and approximately 200k agent-interaction question-answer pairs. Experiments show that ForenAgent exhibits emergent tool-use competence and reflective reasoning on challenging IFD tasks when assisted by low-level tools, charting a promising route toward general-purpose IFD. The code will be released after the review process is completed.</p></details> | 11 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Long-Horizon Visual Imitation Learning via Plan and Code Reflection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.05368v3)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning from long-horizon demonstrations with complex action sequences presents significant challenges for visual imitation learning, particularly in understanding temporal relationships of actions and spatial relationships between objects. In this paper, we propose a new agent framework that incorporates two dedicated reflection modules to enhance both plan and code generation. The plan generation module produces an initial action sequence, which is then verified by the plan reflection module to ensure temporal coherence and spatial alignment with the demonstration video. The code generation module translates the plan into executable code, while the code reflection module verifies and refines the generated code to ensure correctness and consistency with the generated plan. These two reflection modules jointly enable the agent to detect and correct errors in both the plan generation and code generation, improving performance in tasks with intricate temporal and spatial dependencies. To support systematic evaluation, we introduce LongVILBench, a benchmark comprising 300 human demonstrations with action sequences of up to 18 steps. LongVILBench emphasizes temporal and spatial complexity across multiple task types. Experimental results demonstrate that existing methods perform poorly on this benchmark, whereas our new framework establishes a strong baseline for long-horizon visual imitation learning.</p></details> | 9 pages, 4 figures |
| **[A Multi-Language Perspective on the Robustness of LLM Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.19108v4)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have gained significant traction and popularity in recent times, extending their usage to code-generation tasks. While this field has garnered considerable attention, the exploration of testing and evaluating the robustness of code generation models remains an ongoing endeavor. Previous studies have primarily focused on code generation models specifically for the Python language, overlooking other widely-used programming languages. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis to assess the robustness performance of several prominent code generation models and investigate whether robustness can be improved by repairing perturbed docstrings using an LLM. Furthermore, we investigate how their performance varies across different programming languages. To accomplish this, we introduce perturbations in four key areas of the prompt: DocString, functionname, syntax, and format. We have compiled and released a dedicated dataset for this purpose. This work presents our experimental findings, shedding light on the performance of code generation models in various scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 10 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |
| **[Good Locally Testable Codes with Small Alphabet and Small Query Size](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.16082v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ben-Sasson, Goldreich and Sudan showed that a binary error correcting code admitting a $2$-query tester cannot be good, i.e., it cannot have both linear distance and positive rate. The same holds when the alphabet is a finite field $\mathbb{F}$, the code is $\mathbb{F}$-linear, and the $2$-query tester is $\mathbb{F}$-linear. We show that those are essentially the only limitations on the existence of good locally testable codes (LTCs). That is, there are good $2$-query LTCs on any alphabet with more than $2$ letters, and good $3$-query LTCs with a binary alphabet. Similarly, there are good $3$-query $\mathbb{F}$-linear LTCs, and for every $\mathbb{F}$-vector space $V$ of dimension greater than $1$, there are good $2$-query LTCs with alphabet $V$ whose tester is $\mathbb{F}$-linear. This completely solves, for every $q\geq 2$ and alphabet (resp. $\mathbb{F}$-vector space) $Σ$, the question of whether there is a good $q$-query LTC (resp. $\mathbb{F}$-LTC) with alphabet $Σ$.

| **[Deflating quantum error-correcting codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15887v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce a technique for reducing the length of a quantum stabilizer code, and we call this deflation of the code. Deflation can be seen as a generalization of the well-known puncturing and shortening techniques in cases where more than a single qudit is removed. We show that the parameters of the deflated quantum code can be controlled, and argue that a similar approach is not as beneficial when applied to classical linear codes. Furthermore, it is shown that deflation introduces additional freedom compared to applying just puncturing and shortening consecutively. We exemplify that it is possible to obtain better parameters by deflating a code rather than consecutively using puncturing and shortening.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE transactions on information theory November 21, 2025</p></details> |
| **[Beam search decoder for quantum LDPC codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07057v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a decoder for quantum low density parity check (LDPC) codes based on a beam search heuristic guided by belief propagation (BP). Our beam search decoder applies to all quantum LDPC codes and achieves different speed-accuracy tradeoffs by tuning its parameters such as the beam width. We perform numerical simulations under circuit level noise for the $[[144, 12, 12]]$ bivariate bicycle (BB) code at noise rate $p=10^{-3}$ to estimate the logical error rate and the 99.9 percentile runtime and we compare with the BP-OSD decoder which has been the default quantum LDPC decoder for the past six years. A variant of our beam search decoder with a beam width of 64 achieves a $17\times$ reduction in logical error rate. With a beam width of 8, we reach the same logical error rate as BP-OSD with a $26.2\times$ reduction in the 99.9 percentile runtime. We identify the beam search decoder with beam width of 32 as a promising candidate for trapped ion architectures because it achieves a $5.6\times$ reduction in logical error rate with a 99.9 percentile runtime per syndrome extraction round below 1ms at $p=5 \times10^{-4}$. Remarkably, this is achieved in software on a single core, without any parallelization or specialized hardware (FPGA, ASIC), suggesting one might only need three 32-core CPUs to decode a trapped ion quantum computer with 1000 logical qubits.</p></details> | <details><summary>We ha...</summary><p>We have released the implementation source code at https://github.com/ionq-publications/BeamSearchDecoder</p></details> |
| **[Bidirectional predictive coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23415v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive coding (PC) is an influential computational model of visual learning and inference in the brain. Classical PC was proposed as a top-down generative model, where the brain actively predicts upcoming visual inputs, and inference minimises the prediction errors. Recent studies have also shown that PC can be formulated as a discriminative model, where sensory inputs predict neural activities in a feedforward manner. However, experimental evidence suggests that the brain employs both generative and discriminative inference, while unidirectional PC models show degraded performance in tasks requiring bidirectional processing. In this work, we propose bidirectional PC (bPC), a PC model that incorporates both generative and discriminative inference while maintaining a biologically plausible circuit implementation. We show that bPC matches or outperforms unidirectional models in their specialised generative or discriminative tasks, by developing an energy landscape that simultaneously suits both tasks. We also demonstrate bPC's superior performance in two biologically relevant tasks including multimodal learning and inference with missing information, suggesting that bPC resembles biological visual inference more closely.</p></details> |  |
| **[How Do Semantically Equivalent Code Transformations Impact Membership Inference on LLMs for Code?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15468v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The success of large language models for code relies on vast amounts of code data, including public open-source repositories, such as GitHub, and private, confidential code from companies. This raises concerns about intellectual property compliance and the potential unauthorized use of license-restricted code. While membership inference (MI) techniques have been proposed to detect such unauthorized usage, their effectiveness can be undermined by semantically equivalent code transformation techniques, which modify code syntax while preserving semantic. In this work, we systematically investigate whether semantically equivalent code transformation rules might be leveraged to evade MI detection. The results reveal that model accuracy drops by only 1.5% in the worst case for each rule, demonstrating that transformed datasets can effectively serve as substitutes for fine-tuning. Additionally, we find that one of the rules (RenameVariable) reduces MI success by 10.19%, highlighting its potential to obscure the presence of restricted code. To validate these findings, we conduct a causal analysis confirming that variable renaming has the strongest causal effect in disrupting MI detection. Notably, we find that combining multiple transformations does not further reduce MI effectiveness. Our results expose a critical loophole in license compliance enforcement for training large language models for code, showing that MI detection can be substantially weakened by transformation-based obfuscation techniques.</p></details> | 13 pages, 3 figures |

Existing evaluation methods for code review generation either rely on automatic comparisons to a single ground truth, which fails to capture the variability of human perspectives, or on subjective assessments of "usefulness", a highly ambiguous concept. We propose a novel evaluation approach based on what we call multi-subjective ranking. Using a dataset of 280 self-contained code review requests and corresponding comments from CodeReview StackExchange, multiple human judges ranked the quality of ChatGPT-generated comments alongside the top human responses from the platform. Results show that ChatGPT's comments were ranked significantly better than human ones, even surpassing StackExchange's accepted answers. Going further, our proposed method motivates and enables more meaningful assessments of generative AI's performance in code review, while also raising awareness of potential risks of unchecked integration into review processes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Repli...</summary><p>Replication Package: https://github.com/robert-heumueller-ovgu/repl-generative-review-relevance</p></details> |

However, due to the difficulty in effectively evaluating intermediate algorithmic steps and the inability to locate and timely correct erroneous steps, these methods often generate incorrect code and incur increased computational costs. To tackle these problems, we propose RPM-MCTS, an effective method that utilizes Knowledge-Retrieval as Process Reward Model based on Monte Carlo Tree Search to evaluate intermediate algorithmic steps. By utilizing knowledge base retrieval, RPM-MCTS avoids the complex training of process reward models. During the expansion phase, similarity filtering is employed to remove redundant nodes, ensuring diversity in reasoning paths. Furthermore, our method utilizes sandbox execution feedback to locate erroneous algorithmic steps during generation, enabling timely and targeted corrections. Extensive experiments on four public code generation benchmarks demonstrate that RPM-MCTS outperforms current state-of-the-art methods while achieving an approximately 15% reduction in token consumption. Furthermore, full fine-tuning of the base model using the data constructed by RPM-MCTS significantly enhances its code capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Despite the well-established correlation between audio and lip movements, this cross-modal coherence has not been systematically exploited for compression. To address this, we propose an Audio-Visual Cross-Modal Compression (AVCC) framework that jointly compresses audio and video streams. Our framework extracts motion information from video and tokenizes audio features, then aligns them through a unified audio-video diffusion process. This allows synchronized reconstruction of both modalities from a shared representation. In extremely low-rate scenarios, AVCC can even reconstruct one modality from the other. Experiments show that AVCC significantly outperforms the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) standard and state-of-the-art GFVC schemes in rate-distortion performance, paving the way for more efficient multimodal communication systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as a PAPER and for publication in the DCC 2026 proceedings</p></details> |
| **[Feature Importance-Aware Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding for Computationally Efficient and Adjustable Image Transmission](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04758v3)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (deepJSCC) have substantially improved communication performance, but their high computational cost hinders practical deployment. Moreover, certain applications require the ability to dynamically adapt computational complexity. To address these issues, we propose a Feature Importance-Aware deepJSCC (FAJSCC) model for image transmission that is both computationally efficient and adjustable. FAJSCC employs axis-dimension specialized computation, which performs efficient operations individually for each spatial and channel axis, significantly reducing computational cost while representing features effectively. It further incorporates selective deformable self-attention, which applies self-attention only to selected and adaptively adjusted features, leveraging the importance and relations of input features to efficiently capture complex feature correlations. Another key feature of FAJSCC is that the number of selected important areas can be controlled separately by the encoder and the decoder, depending on the available computational budget. It makes FAJSCC the first deepJSCC architecture to allow independent adjustment of encoder and decoder complexity within a single trained model. Experimental results show that FAJSCC achieves superior image transmission performance under various channel conditions while requiring less computational complexity than recent state-of-the-art models. Furthermore, experiments independently varying the encoder and decoder's computational resources reveal, for the first time in the deepJSCC literature, that understanding the meaning of noisy features in the decoder demands the greatest computational cost. The code is publicly available at github.com/hansung-choi/FAJSCCv2.</p></details> |  |
| **[An Exploratory Study of Bayesian Prompt Optimization for Test-Driven Code Generation with Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15076v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider the task of generating functionally correct code using large language models (LLMs). The correctness of generated code is influenced by the prompt used to query the given base LLM. We formulate the problem of finding the appropriate prompt as combinatorial search process and propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) approach referred to as {\em BO for Code GENeration (BODE-GEN)}. BODE-GEN performs an adaptive data-driven search over prompts guided by training data in the form of prompts tried and the functional accuracy of the generated code over a set of given test cases. The key insight is to perform BO in continuous embedding space by using an auxiliary LLM to bridge the gap between discrete prompt space and continuous embedding space. We leverage two synergistic ideas, namely, random projections and dimensionality scaled priors, to build effective Gaussian process based surrogate models over the high-dimensional embedding space. Our experiments on the HumanEval+ benchmark using multiple base LLMs show that BODE-GEN can improve performance in terms of code generation accuracy compared to fixed prompts and manual prompt engineering. Additionally, we demonstrate that BODE-GEN is sample-efficient, requiring relatively few iterations of BO to demonstrate improvements in code accuracy.</p></details> | 20 pages, 13 figures |
| **[Confucius Code Agent: Scalable Agent Scaffolding for Real-World Codebases](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10398v4)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world software engineering tasks require coding agents that can operate over massive repositories, sustain long-horizon sessions, and reliably coordinate complex toolchains at test time. Existing research-grade agents offer transparency but struggle when scaled to real-world workloads, while proprietary systems achieve strong practical performance but provide limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We introduce the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), a scalable software engineering agent that can operate at large-scale codebases. CCA is built on top of the Confucius SDK, an agent development platform structured around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK integrates a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension system for reliable tool use. In addition, we introduce a meta-agent that automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid adaptation to new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated with these mechanisms, CCA demonstrates strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA reaches a Resolve@1 of 54.3%, exceeding prior research baselines and comparing favorably to commercial results, under identical repositories, model backend, and tool access. Together, the Confucius SDK and CCA form a general, extensible, and production-grade foundation for building effective and robust coding agents, bridging the gap between research prototypes and practical large-scale deployment.</p></details> | The latest version |
| **[On the Stochastic Analysis of Random Linear Streaming Codes in Multi-Hop Relay Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15049v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we aim to explore the stochastic performance limit of large-field-size Random Linear Streaming Codes (RLSCs) in multi-hop relay networks. In our model, a source transmits a sequence of streaming messages to a destination through multiple relays subject to a delay constraint. Most previous research focused on deterministic adversarial channel which introduces only restricted types of erasure patterns, and aimed to design the optimal capacity-achieving codes. In this paper, we focus on stochastic channel where each hop is subject to i.i.d. packet erasures, and carry out stochastic analysis on the error probability of multi-hop RLSCs. Our contributions are three-folds. Firstly, the error event of large-field-size RLSCs is characterized in two-hop relay network with a novel framework, which features quantification of information flowing through each node in the network. Due to the erasures in different hops, some source symbols can be "detained" at the source or relay while others have arrived at the destination. By iteratively computing the number of detained symbols at each node, this framework extends the concept "information debt" from point-to-point network [Pinwen Su et al. 2022] into two-hop relay networks. Secondly, based on the error event, the expression of average error probability in two-hop network is derived by carefully analyzing the expectation terms. To handle the expectation over all possible erasure patterns along two hops of the network, the transition matrices of the detained symbols are novelly constructed in a "band fashion" with nested structure. Thirdly, the derived results in two-hop network are further generalized into relay networks with arbitrary number of hops. Furthermore, simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of our stochastic analysis, and compare with some existing streaming codes for the adversarial channels.</p></details> |  |

We propose DreamPRM-Code, a coding-focused PRM that treats functions as reasoning steps using a Chain-of-Function prompting strategy to induce modular code generation, enabling PRM training and application analogous to mathematical reasoning tasks. To address label noise, DreamPRM-Code introduces a meta-learning-based correction mechanism that leverages clean final-solution unit-test labels and performs bi-level optimization to refine intermediate labels. Applying on test-time scaling, DreamPRM-Code achieved state-of-the-art performance on LiveCodeBench with 80.9 pass@1 rate, surpassing OpenAI o4-mini.</p></details> |  |

| **[Evaluating Code Reasoning Abilities of Large Language Models Under Real-World Settings](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14917v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code reasoning tasks are becoming prevalent in large language model (LLM) assessments. Existing benchmarks involve simple programs, failing to represent real-world complexities such as inter- or intra-procedural dependencies, core or third-party API calls, highly nested constructs, and non-primitive complex types. Evaluating LLMs under such a simplistic setting poses a significant threat to assumptions about their generalizability in practice. To enable a more realistic evaluation of code reasoning, this paper proposes RE2-Bench, a benchmark of 1,101 reasoning problems, including 195 drawn from mature real-world projects. RE2-Bench leverages static and dynamic program analysis to automatically serialize and deserialize compound, complex, and custom types in real-world code, going far beyond the primitive-only settings used in prior work. A key feature of RE2-Bench is categorizing each reasoning problem as Easy or Hard via a principled majority-vote mechanism over nine interpretable code complexity metrics, resulting in two well-separated and semantically meaningful difficulty categories suitable for precise calibration of LLM reasoning ability. A comprehensive evaluation of six general-purpose and reasoning-oriented LLMs on two widely used code reasoning tasks -- input prediction and output prediction -- using RE2-Bench reveals a significant performance drop from Easy to Hard problems (51.50\% for input prediction and 42.15\% for output prediction), confirming that prior evaluations substantially overestimate the reasoning capabilities of LLMs.</p></details> |  |

Maximum period non-binary single-track Gray codes of length $p^t$ and period $p^{p^t}$ are constructed. These are the first infinite families of maximum period codes presented in the literature.</p></details> |  |

Manually identifying such vulnerabilities is tedious. Meanwhile, static security scanners tend to produce many false positives. While machine learning-based approaches are promising, they typically perform well only in scenarios where training and test data are closely related. A key challenge for ML-based vulnerability detection is providing suitable and concise code context, as excessively long contexts negatively affect the code comprehension capabilities of machine learning models, particularly smaller ones. This work introduces Trace Gadgets, a novel code representation that minimizes code context by removing non-related code. Trace Gadgets precisely capture the statements that cover the path to the vulnerability. As input for ML models, Trace Gadgets provide a minimal but complete context, thereby improving the detection performance. Moreover, we collect a large-scale dataset generated from real-world applications with manually curated labels to further improve the performance of ML-based vulnerability detectors. Our results show that state-of-the-art machine learning models perform best when using Trace Gadgets compared to previous code representations, surpassing the detection capabilities of industry-standard static scanners such as GitHub's CodeQL by at least 4% on a fully unseen dataset. By applying our framework to real-world applications, we identify and report previously unknown vulnerabilities in widely deployed software.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in the Proceedings of ACM ASIA CCS 2026</p></details> |

However, developing cloud-of-things (CoT) applications remains challenging. It requires significant technical expertise and lacks standardized, model-driven methodologies. Current approaches fail to ensure interoperability, automation, and efficiency. This study introduces the Model of Things (MoT), a model-based approach that incorporates low-code principles to simplify CoT development. MoT reduces technical barriers by providing a custom UML profile designed for IoT and cloud services. To evaluate MoT, we conducted a case study and a Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) questionnaire. The results confirmed MoT's feasibility, demonstrating that it streamlines CoT application development and deployment. Users found MoT accessible, even with limited IoT experience, and reported high perceived ease of use and usefulness. Qualitative feedback highlighted MoT's ability to reduce complexity and speed up development. MoT offers a promising, model-driven solution for CoT application development. By lowering entry barriers and promoting automation, it enhances both efficiency and flexibility. This study represents a step toward a more user-friendly framework, enabling broader adoption of CoT technologies.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 23 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

Many benchmarks have been proposed to evaluate the performance of such code translators. However, previous benchmarks mostly provide fine-grained samples, focusing at either code snippet, function, or file-level code translation. Such benchmarks do not accurately reflect real-world demands, where entire repositories often need to be translated, involving longer code length and more complex functionalities. To address this gap, we propose a new benchmark, named RepoTransBench, which is a real-world multilingual repository-level code translation benchmark featuring 1,897 real-world repository samples across 13 language pairs with automatically executable test suites. Besides, we introduce RepoTransAgent, a general agent framework to perform repository-level code translation. We evaluate both our benchmark's challenges and agent's effectiveness using several methods and backbone LLMs, revealing that repository-level translation remains challenging, where the best-performing method achieves only a 32.8% success rate. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that translation difficulty varies significantly by language pair direction, with dynamic-to-static language translation being much more challenging than the reverse direction (achieving below 10% vs. static-to-dynamic at 45-63%). Finally, we conduct a detailed error analysis and highlight current LLMs' deficiencies in repository-level code translation, which could provide a reference for further improvements. We provide the code and data at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/RepoTransBench.</p></details> |  |

The platform independence offered through Wasm makes it an attractive solution for many different applications that can run on disparate infrastructures. In addition, Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) are offered in many computing infrastructures, which allows also running security sensitive Wasm workloads independent of the specific platforms offered. However, recent work has shown that Wasm binaries are more sensitive to code confidentiality attacks than native binaries. The previous result was obtained for Intel SGX only. In this paper, we take this one step further, introducing a new Wasm code-confidentiality attack that exploits exposed address-space information in TEEs. Our attack enables the extraction of crucial execution features which, when combined with additional side channels, allows us to with high reliability obtain more than 70% of the code in most cases. This is a considerably larger amount than was previously obtained by single stepping Intel SGX where only upwards to 50% of the code could be obtained.</p></details> | <details><summary>10 Pa...</summary><p>10 Pages, 1 Table, 5 Figures</p></details> |

These new bounds give upper bounds on the length of maximum distance separable (MDS) codes, codes which attain the Singleton bound. We will also consider codes to be MDS if they attain the fractional Singleton bound, due to Huffman. We prove that this bound in the fractional case can be obtained by codes whose length surpasses the length of the longest known codes in the integral case. For small parameters, we provide exhaustive computational results for additive MDS codes, by classifying the corresponding (fractional) subspace-arcs. This includes a complete classification of fractional additive MDS codes of size 243 over the field of order 9.</p></details> |  |

Stabiliser codes were introduced as a means to protect information when storing or applying computations in Hilbert spaces where the local dimension is fixed, i.e. in Hilbert spaces of the form $({\mathbb C}^D)^{\otimes n}$. If $D$ is a prime power then one can consider stabiliser codes over finite fields \cite{KKKS2006}, which allows a deeper mathematical structure to be used to develop stabiliser codes. However, there is no practical reason that the subsystems should have the same local dimension and in this article we introduce a stabiliser formalism for mixed dimensional Hilbert spaces, i.e. of the form ${\mathbb C}^{D_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes {\mathbb C}^{D_n}$. More generally, we define and prove a Singleton bound for quantum error-correcting codes of mixed dimensional Hilbert spaces. We redefine entanglement measures for these Hilbert spaces and follow \cite{HESG2018} and define absolutely maximally entangled states as states which maximise this entanglement measure. We provide examples of absolutely maximally entangled states in spaces of dimensions not previously known to have absolutely maximally entangled states.</p></details> |  |

These codes are derived from quadratic forms through a bivariate construction. We completely determine their complete weight enumerators and weight hierarchies by employing exponential sums. Most of these codes are minimal and some are optimal in the sense that they meet the Griesmer bound. Furthermore, we also establish the weight hierarchies of $\mathcal{C}_{Q,N}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{Q,N}'$, which are the descended codes of $\mathcal{C}_{Q}$ and $\mathcal{C}_{Q}'$.</p></details> |  |

Existing chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting methods enhance model reasoning by eliciting intermediate steps, but suffer from two major limitations: First, their uniform application tends to induce overthinking on simple tasks. Second, they lack intention abstraction in code generation, such as explicitly modeling core algorithmic design and efficiency, leading models to focus on surface-level structures while neglecting the global problem objective. Inspired by the cognitive economy principle of engaging structured reasoning only when necessary to conserve cognitive resources, we propose RoutingGen, a novel difficulty-aware routing framework that dynamically adapts prompting strategies for code generation. For simple tasks, it adopts few-shot prompting; for more complex ones, it invokes a structured reasoning strategy, termed Intention Chain-of-Thought (ICoT), which we introduce to guide the model in capturing task intention, such as the core algorithmic logic and its time complexity. Experiments across three models and six standard code generation benchmarks show that RoutingGen achieves state-of-the-art performance in most settings, while reducing total token usage by 46.37% on average across settings.

However, fine-tuning these models on private datasets can raise privacy and proprietary concerns, such as the leakage of sensitive personal information. Differentially private (DP) code generation provides theoretical guarantees for protecting sensitive code by generating synthetic datasets that preserve statistical properties while reducing privacy leakage concerns. However, DP code generation faces significant challenges due to the strict syntactic dependencies and the privacy-utility trade-off. We propose PrivCode, the first DP synthesizer specifically designed for code datasets. It incorporates a two-stage framework to improve both privacy and utility. In the first stage, termed "privacy-sanitizing", PrivCode generates DP-compliant synthetic code by training models using DP-SGD while introducing syntactic information to preserve code structure. The second stage, termed "utility-boosting", fine-tunes a larger pre-trained LLM on the synthetic privacy-free code to mitigate the utility loss caused by DP, enhancing the utility of the generated code. Extensive experiments on four LLMs show that PrivCode generates higher-utility code across various testing tasks under four benchmarks. The experiments also confirm its ability to protect sensitive data under varying privacy budgets. We provide the replication package at the anonymous link.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NDSS 2026; code available at https://github.com/Liuzzyg/PrivCode</p></details> |
| **[PerfCoder: Large Language Models for Interpretable Code Performance Optimization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14018v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable progress in automatic code generation, yet their ability to produce high-performance code remains limited--a critical requirement in real-world software systems. We argue that current LLMs struggle not only due to data scarcity but, more importantly, because they lack supervision that guides interpretable and effective performance improvements. In this work, we introduce PerfCoder, a family of LLMs specifically designed to generate performance-enhanced code from source code via interpretable, customized optimizations. PerfCoder is fine-tuned on a curated collection of real-world optimization trajectories with human-readable annotations, and preference-aligned by reinforcement fine-tuning using runtime measurements, enabling it to propose input-specific improvement strategies and apply them directly without relying on iterative refinement. On the PIE code performance benchmark, PerfCoder surpasses all existing models in both runtime speedup and effective optimization rate, demonstrating that performance optimization cannot be achieved by scale alone but requires optimization stratetgy awareness. In addition, PerfCoder can generate interpretable feedback about the source code, which, when provided as input to a larger LLM in a planner-and-optimizer cooperative workflow, can further improve outcomes. Specifically, we elevate the performance of 32B models and GPT-5 to new levels on code optimization, substantially surpassing their original performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Professional Software Developers Don't Vibe, They Control: AI Agent Use for Coding in 2025](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14012v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of AI agents is transforming how software can be built. The promise of agents is that developers might write code quicker, delegate multiple tasks to different agents, and even write a full piece of software purely out of natural language. In reality, what roles agents play in professional software development remains in question. This paper investigates how experienced developers use agents in building software, including their motivations, strategies, task suitability, and sentiments. Through field observations (N=13) and qualitative surveys (N=99), we find that while experienced developers value agents as a productivity boost, they retain their agency in software design and implementation out of insistence on fundamental software quality attributes, employing strategies for controlling agent behavior leveraging their expertise. In addition, experienced developers feel overall positive about incorporating agents into software development given their confidence in complementing the agents' limitations. Our results shed light on the value of software development best practices in effective use of agents, suggest the kinds of tasks for which agents may be suitable, and point towards future opportunities for better agentic interfaces and agentic use guidelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Workflows vs Agents for Code Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14762v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating algorithms from high-level languages like MATLAB to hardware description languages (HDLs) is a resource-intensive but necessary step for deployment on FPGAs and ASICs. While large language models (LLMs) offer a path to automation, their limited training on HDL code makes end-to-end transpilation brittle and prone to syntax errors. We compare two LLM-driven methods for syntax repair in a MATLAB-to-HDL pipeline: a structured, expert-designed flow that follows a fixed sequence of operations, and a more autonomous agentic approach that uses the Model Context Protocol (MCP) \cite{anthropic2024mcp} to dynamically select its own tools. We study 42 MATLAB signal-processing functions and isolate the syntax-repair stage. Across three model scales, the agentic approach is more effective at resolving initial syntax errors, unblocking a greater number of candidates to proceed through the pipeline. This upstream improvement yields measurable downstream improvements, most notably on mid-sized models, where it increases the simulation reach rate by over 20 percentage points. We hypothesize the gains come from short prompts, aggressive context management, and conditional tool use. Conditional retrieval helps at 8B and 30B; at 235B final-success gains are small and a naive RAG variant attains the highest final success. Our findings suggest that these agentic frameworks, when properly designed, are most effective at compensating for the capacity limits of small and mid-sized models.</p></details> |  |
| **[The Double Life of Code World Models: Provably Unmasking Malicious Behavior Through Execution Traces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13821v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) increasingly generate code with minimal human oversight, raising critical concerns about backdoor injection and malicious behavior. We present Cross-Trace Verification Protocol (CTVP), a novel AI control framework that verifies untrusted code-generating models through semantic orbit analysis. Rather than directly executing potentially malicious code, CTVP leverages the model's own predictions of execution traces across semantically equivalent program transformations. By analyzing consistency patterns in these predicted traces, we detect behavioral anomalies indicative of backdoors. Our approach introduces the Adversarial Robustness Quotient (ARQ), which quantifies the computational cost of verification relative to baseline generation, demonstrating exponential growth with orbit size. Theoretical analysis establishes information-theoretic bounds showing non-gamifiability -- adversaries cannot improve through training due to fundamental space complexity constraints. This work demonstrates that semantic orbit analysis provides a scalable, theoretically grounded approach to AI control for code generation tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>13 Pa...</summary><p>13 Pages, Initial Work on AI Control.

| **[Hyper-Minrank: A Unified Hypergraph Characterization of Multi-Sender Index Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13615v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work introduces a hypergraph formulation that generalizes the classical paradigm of Bar-Yossef et al. to the multi-sender index coding (MSIC) setting. Central to the model is a 4-regular side-information hypergraph G, a new adjacency representation A_G = [A_1 ... A_N], and a simple fitting criterion for sub-hypergraph validity, in the presence of specially designed hyperedges that capture both side information and cross-sender signal cancellation. This formulation establishes a tight achievability-converse equivalence for the general N-sender, K-receiver problem: every valid fitting induces a valid linear multi-sender index code, every linear code induces a valid fitting, and the optimal scalar linear broadcast length equals the hyper-minrank l**lin(G) = hyperminrank(G) = min*{A fits G} sum_{n=1}^N rank(A_n). Beyond this exact characterization, the approach yields hypergraph analogues of Haemers-type bounds on the broadcast length, including a clique-cover upper bound and a lower bound via the clique number of a carefully defined complement hypergraph. Algorithmically, we provide an exact procedure to compute hyperminrank(G), and show that in certain regimes its complexity is asymptotically better than approximate LT-CMAR solutions. The framework captures well-known settings such as embedded index coding, and applies directly to multi-sender cache-aided communications, coded computation, distributed storage, and edge/satellite systems, where hyperminrank can serve as a unified design target.</p></details> | 46 pages, 9 figures |
| **[Fine-tuned LLM-based Code Migration Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13515v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The study presents the outcomes of research and experimental validation in the domain of automated codebase migration, with a focus on addressing challenges in transitioning SQL-based systems. The proposed method for migration essentially appears as a framework that leverages the best aspects of traditional software engineering techniques and provides an iterative, scalable, precise and efficient solution for modern database transformations. The central piece of the approach is the integration of a fine-tuned Large Language Model to address critical issues in SQL code conversion, such as syntax mapping, resolving discrepancies between Oracle PL/SQL and PostgreSQL, and optimising database elements such as stored procedures, triggers, views, and overall database logic. Thus, the method involves a trade-off between fine-tuning and prompt engineering. Special attention is given to a fine-tuning approach, which enhances the adaptability and compatibility with migration requirements across the entire database. According to the achieved results, fine-tuning plays a very important role. The study employs targeted evaluation methodologies along with computational metrics to measure the success of iterative conversion cycles. Core innovations include automated SQL feature detection, semi-supervised error analysis and integration of Subject Matter Experts feedback within a systematic migration workflow. The methodology achieves significant reductions in Syntax Error Rates, enhances feature alignment throughout migration iterations, and leverages dataset sampling to ensure continual improvement. By embedding GAI into the migration process, the framework facilitates precise feature mapping, semi-automated error resolution, and data-driven optimisation loops, improving workflow efficiency.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 27 figures, 7 references</p></details> |

This code generator organization derives complex indexing expressions associated with hierarchical parallel code and data movement for GPUs. LEGO maps from layout specification to indexing expressions, and can be integrated into existing compilers and code templates. It facilitates the exploration of data layouts in combination with other optimizations. We demonstrate LEGO's integration with the Triton and MLIR compilers, and with CUDA templates. We show that LEGO is capable of deriving performance competitive with Triton, and shows broad applicability for data and thread layout mapping optimizations in its integration with CUDA and MLIR.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaling Laws for Code: Every Programming Language Matters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13472v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code large language models (Code LLMs) are powerful but costly to train, with scaling laws predicting performance from model size, data, and compute. However, different programming languages (PLs) have varying impacts during pre-training that significantly affect base model performance, leading to inaccurate performance prediction. Besides, existing works focus on language-agnostic settings, neglecting the inherently multilingual nature of modern software development. Therefore, it is first necessary to investigate the scaling laws of different PLs, and then consider their mutual influences to arrive at the final multilingual scaling law. In this paper, we present the first systematic exploration of scaling laws for multilingual code pre-training, conducting over 1000+ experiments (Equivalent to 336,000+ H800 hours) across multiple PLs, model sizes (0.2B to 14B parameters), and dataset sizes (1T tokens). We establish comprehensive scaling laws for code LLMs across multiple PLs, revealing that interpreted languages (e.g., Python) benefit more from increased model size and data than compiled languages (e.g., Rust). The study demonstrates that multilingual pre-training provides synergistic benefits, particularly between syntactically similar PLs. Further, the pre-training strategy of the parallel pairing (concatenating code snippets with their translations) significantly enhances cross-lingual abilities with favorable scaling properties. Finally, a proportion-dependent multilingual scaling law is proposed to optimally allocate training tokens by prioritizing high-utility PLs (e.g., Python), balancing high-synergy pairs (e.g., JavaScript-TypeScript), and reducing allocation to fast-saturating languages (Rust), achieving superior average performance across all PLs compared to uniform distribution under the same compute budget.</p></details> |  |
| **[Error Exponents for Oblivious Relaying and Connections to Source Coding with a Helper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.00567v2)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The information bottleneck channel, also known as oblivious relaying, is a two-hop channel where a transmitter sends messages to a remote receiver via an intermediate relay node. A codeword sent by the transmitter passes through a discrete memoryless channel to reach the relay, which then processes the noisy channel output and forwards it to the receiver through a noiseless rate-limited link. The relay is oblivious, in the sense that it has no knowledge of the channel codebook used in transmission. Previous works on oblivious relaying focus on characterizing achievable rates. In this work, we study error exponents and explore connections to lossless source coding with a helper, also known as the Wyner-Ahlswede-Körner (WAK) problem. We first establish an achievable error exponent for oblivious relaying under constant compositions codes. A key feature of our analysis is the use of the type covering lemma to design the relay's compress-forward scheme. We then show that employing constant composition code ensembles does not improve the rates achieved with their IID counterparts. We also derive a sphere packing upper bound for the error exponent. In the second part of this paper, we establish a connection between the information bottleneck channel and the WAK problem. We show that good codes for the latter can be produced through permuting codes designed for the former. This is accomplished by revisiting Ahlswede's covering lemma, and extending it to achieve simultaneous covering of a type class by several distinct sets using the same sequence of permutations. We then apply our approach to attain the best known achievable error exponent for the WAK problem, previously established by Kelly and Wagner. As a byproduct of our derivations, we also establish error exponents and achievable rates under mismatched decoding rules.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |

| **[Mathematics and Coding are Universal AI Benchmarks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13764v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the special role of mathematics and coding inside the moduli space of psychometric batteries for AI agents. Building on the AAI framework and GVU dynamics from previous works, we define the Mathematics Fiber and show that, when paired with formal proof kernels (e.g. Lean, Coq), GVU flows on this fiber admit spectrally stable self-improvement regimes due to oracle-like verification. Our main technical result is a density theorem: under uniform tightness of agent outputs and a Lipschitz AAI functional, the subspace of batteries generated by mathematical theorem-proving and coding tasks is dense in the moduli space of batteries with respect to the evaluation metric. Coding alone is universal in this sense, while pure mathematics is not; its privilege is spectral rather than expressive. We interpret this as evidence that mathematics and coding provide ``universal coordinates'' for evaluation, and that formal mathematics is a natural ignition domain for recursive self-improvement in advanced AI agents.</p></details> |  |
| **[Machine learning discovers new champion codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13370v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Linear error-correcting codes form the mathematical backbone of modern digital communication and storage systems, but identifying champion linear codes (linear codes achieving or exceeding the best known minimum Hamming distance) remains challenging. By training a transformer to predict the minimum Hamming distance of a class of linear codes and pairing it with a genetic algorithm over the search space, we develop a novel method for discovering champion codes. This model effectively reduces the search space of linear codes needed to achieve champion codes. Our results present the use of this method in the study and construction of error-correcting codes, applicable to codes such as generalised toric, Reed-Muller, Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem, algebrogeometric, and potentially quantum codes.</p></details> | 23 pages, 9 figures |

Also, we determine the algebraic structure of double cyclic codes of length $(m, n)$ over $\mathbb{F}_4+v\mathbb{F}_4$ with $v^2=v$, satisfying the reverse constraint and the reverse-complement constraint. Then we establish a one-to-one correspondence $ψ$ between the 16 DNA double pairs $S_{D_{16}} $ and the 16 elements of the finite ring $\mathbb{F}_4+v\mathbb{F}_4$. We also discuss the GC-content of DNA double cyclic codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coding-Enforced Robust Secure Aggregation for Federated Learning Under Unreliable Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07565v4)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This work studies privacy-preserving federated learning (ppFL) under unreliable communication. In ppFL, zero-sum privacy noises enables privacy protection without sacrificing model accuracy, effectively overcoming the privacy-utility trade-off. However, in practice, unreliable communication can randomly disrupt the coordination of zero-sum noises, leading to aggregation errors and unpredictable partial participation, which severely harm the model accuracy and learning performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a robust coding-enforced structured secure aggregation method, termed secure cooperative gradient coding (SecCoGC), which enables exact reconstruction of the global model under unreliable communication while allowing for arbitrarily strong privacy preservation. In this paper, a complete problem formulation and constructions of real-field zero-sum privacy noise are presented, and fairness is introduced as a privacy metric. Privacy across all protocol layers in SecCoGC is evaluated, accounting for the correlation among privacy noises and their linear combination under unreliable communication. Moreover, a distinct convergence analysis for the FL algorithm with a binary outcome for global model recovery is provided. Experimental results demonstrate that SecCoGC achieves strong resilience to unreliable communication while maintaining varying levels of privacy preservation, yielding test accuracy improvements of up to 20%-70% over existing benchmark methods.</p></details> |  |

We determine the exact value of the function \( L_{\mathrm{rk}}(n, m, k, q) \) for all admissible parameters \( n, m, k, q \). In particular, we characterize when a code achieves the full weight spectrum (FWS), i.e. when the number of distinct nonzero rank weights equals \( \min\{n, m\} \). We provide both necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of FWS codes, along with explicit constructions of codes attaining the maximum number of distinct weights. We discuss the equivalence of such codes and also present classification results for 2-dimensional codes. Finally, we investigate further properties of these optimal codes, like their behavior under duality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharpen the Spec, Cut the Code: A Case for Generative File System with SYSSPEC](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13047v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>File systems are critical OS components that require constant evolution to support new hardware and emerging application needs. However, the traditional paradigm of developing features, fixing bugs, and maintaining the system incurs significant overhead, especially as systems grow in complexity. This paper proposes a new paradigm, generative file systems, which leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate and evolve a file system from prompts, effectively addressing the need for robust evolution. Despite the widespread success of LLMs in code generation, attempts to create a functional file system have thus far been unsuccessful, mainly due to the ambiguity of natural language prompts. This paper introduces SYSSPEC, a framework for developing generative file systems. Its key insight is to replace ambiguous natural language with principles adapted from formal methods. Instead of imprecise prompts, SYSSPEC employs a multi-part specification that accurately describes a file system's functionality, modularity, and concurrency. The specification acts as an unambiguous blueprint, guiding LLMs to generate expected code flexibly. To manage evolution, we develop a DAG-structured patch that operates on the specification itself, enabling new features to be added without violating existing invariants. Moreover, the SYSSPEC toolchain features a set of LLM-based agents with mechanisms to mitigate hallucination during construction and evolution. We demonstrate our approach by generating SPECFS, a concurrent file system. SPECFS passes hundreds of regression tests, matching a manually-coded baseline. We further confirm its evolvability by seamlessly integrating 10 real-world features from Ext4. Our work shows that a specification-guided approach makes generating and evolving complex systems not only feasible but also highly effective.</p></details> |  |

A major challenge lies in the determination of their parameters. We address this issue by employing quadratic Galois extensions, proposing two general constructions of $2\times2$ sum-rank codes. Analogous to algebraic geometry codes in the Hamming metric, our codes achieve a larger block length compared to existing constructions. We determine explicit parameters including dimensions and minimum distances of our codes, and we present an illustrative example using elliptic function fields. Finally, we discuss the asymptotic behavior of our codes and compare them with the Gilbert-Varshamov-like bound for sum-rank metric codes.</p></details> |  |

It is especially important to watermark LLM-generated code, as it often contains intellectual property.However, we found that existing methods for watermarking LLM-generated code fail to address comment removal attack.In such cases, an attacker can simply remove the comments from the generated code without affecting its functionality, significantly reducing the effectiveness of current code-watermarking techniques.On the other hand, injecting a watermark into code is challenging because, as previous works have noted, most code represents a low-entropy scenario compared to natural language. Our approach to addressing this issue involves leveraging prior knowledge to distinguish between low-entropy and high-entropy parts of the code, as indicated by a Cue List of words.We then inject the watermark guided by this Cue List, achieving higher detectability and usability than existing methods.We evaluated our proposed method on HumanEvaland compared our method with three state-of-the-art code watermarking techniques. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Fault-Tolerant Sandboxing for AI Coding Agents: A Transactional Approach to Safe Autonomous Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12806v1)** | 2025-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The transition of Large Language Models (LLMs) from passive code generators to autonomous agents introduces significant safety risks, specifically regarding destructive commands and inconsistent system states. Existing commercial solutions often prioritize interactive user safety, enforcing authentication barriers that break the headless loops required for true autonomy. This paper presents a Fault-Tolerant Sandboxing framework designed to mitigate these risks through a policy-based interception layer and a transactional filesystem snapshot mechanism. We hypothesize that wrapping agent actions in atomic transactions can guarantee safety with acceptable latency, outperforming the heavy initialization overhead of containers or the interactive friction of commercial CLIs. We validated this approach by deploying the Minimind-MoE LLM served via nano-vllm on a custom Proxmox-based testbed utilizing EVPN/VXLAN isolation. Experimental results demonstrate a 100\% interception rate for high-risk commands and a 100\% success rate in rolling back failed states. Crucially, our prototype incurs only a 14.5\% performance overhead (approx. 1.8s) per transaction. In contrast, benchmarking against the Gemini CLI sandbox revealed that it requires interactive authentication ("Sign in"), rendering it unusable for headless, autonomous agent workflows.</p></details> | 7 pages |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising alternative, their adoption is impeded by high fine-tuning costs and a lack of "LM-ready" benchmarks. To bridge these gaps, we present a study with two synergistic contributions. First, we constructed a high-quality benchmark for Complex Conditional, Complex Method, Feature Envy, and Data Class, validated through a rigorous two-stage manual review. Second, leveraging this benchmark, we systematically evaluated four Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) methods across nine LMs of varying parameter sizes. Their performance is compared against a comprehensive suite of baselines, including heuristics-based detectors, Deep Learning (DL)-based approaches, and state-of-the-art general-purpose LLMs under multiple In-Context Learning (ICL) settings. Our results demonstrate that PEFT methods achieve effectiveness comparable to or surpassing full fine-tuning while substantially reducing peak GPU memory usage for code smell detection. Furthermore, PEFT-tuned LMs consistently outperform all baselines, yielding MCC improvements ranging from 0.33% to 13.69%, with particularly notable gains for specific smell categories. These findings highlight PEFT techniques as effective and scalable solutions for advancing code smell detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>43 pa...</summary><p>43 pages, 10 images, 13 tables, Manuscript revision submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |

Most prior evaluations focus on localized code generation, scaffolded completion, or short-term repair tasks, leaving open the question of whether agents can sustain coherent reasoning, planning, and execution over the extended horizons demanded by real-world repository construction. To address this gap, we present NL2Repo Bench, a benchmark explicitly designed to evaluate the long-horizon repository generation ability of coding agents. Given only a single natural-language requirements document and an empty workspace, agents must autonomously design the architecture, manage dependencies, implement multi-module logic, and produce a fully installable Python library. Our experiments across state-of-the-art open- and closed-source models reveal that long-horizon repository generation remains largely unsolved: even the strongest agents achieve below 40% average test pass rates and rarely complete an entire repository correctly. Detailed analysis uncovers fundamental long-horizon failure modes, including premature termination, loss of global coherence, fragile cross-file dependencies, and inadequate planning over hundreds of interaction steps. NL2Repo Bench establishes a rigorous, verifiable testbed for measuring sustained agentic competence and highlights long-horizon reasoning as a central bottleneck for the next generation of autonomous coding agents.</p></details> |  |

In response, automated game testing has been viewed as a promising solution to cope with this demanding release cadence. However, existing automated testing approaches typically create a dichotomy: code-centric methods focus on structural coverage without understanding gameplay context, while player-centric agents validate high-level intent but often fail to cover specific underlying code changes. To bridge this gap, we propose SMART (Structural Mapping for Augmented Reinforcement Testing), a novel framework that synergizes structural verification and functional validation for game update testing. SMART leverages large language models (LLMs) to interpret abstract syntax tree (AST) differences and extract functional intent, constructing a context-aware hybrid reward mechanism. This mechanism guides reinforcement learning agents to sequentially fulfill gameplay goals while adaptively exploring modified code branches. We evaluate SMART on two environments, Overcooked and Minecraft. The results demonstrate that SMART significantly outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; it achieves over 94% branch coverage of modified code, nearly double that of traditional reinforcement learning methods, while maintaining a 98% task completion rate, effectively balancing structural comprehensiveness with functional correctness.</p></details> |  |

| **[Serializing Java Objects in Plain Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.11294v4)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In managed languages, serialization of objects is typically done in bespoke binary formats such as Protobuf, or markup languages such as XML or JSON. The major limitation of these formats is readability. Human developers cannot read binary code, and in most cases, suffer from the syntax of XML or JSON. This is a major issue when objects are meant to be embedded and read in source code, such as in test cases. To address this problem, we propose plain-code serialization. Our core idea is to serialize objects observed at runtime in the native syntax of a programming language. We realize this vision in the context of Java, and demonstrate a prototype which serializes Java objects to Java source code. The resulting source faithfully reconstructs the objects seen at runtime. Our prototype is called ProDJ and is publicly available. We experiment with ProDJ to successfully plain-code serialize 174,699 objects observed during the execution of 4 open-source Java applications. Our performance measurement shows that the performance impact is not noticeable. Through a user study, we demonstrate that developers prefer plain-code serialized objects within automatically generated tests over their representations as XML or JSON.</p></details> |  |
| **[Incoherence as Oracle-less Measure of Error in LLM-Based Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.00057v2)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generating code from a natural language programming task is one of the most successful applications of Large Language Models (LLMs). Yet, the generated program may be buggy. Without an oracle, such as an existing, correct implementation or a formal specification, can we somehow estimate how likely the generated program is correct? In this paper, we propose a measure of incorrectness, called *incoherence*, that can be estimated efficiently in the absence of an oracle and allows us to establish a lower bound on the error, i.e., the probability that the LLM-generated program for that specification is incorrect. In our experiments, our incoherence-based methodology can automatically identify about two-thirds of incorrect programs without reports of false positives for the average task. In fact, *an oracle-based evaluation of LLMs can be reliably replaced by an incoherence-based evaluation*. In particular, we find a very strong agreement between the ranking of LLMs by the number of programs deemed correct via an oracle (pass@1) and the ranking of LLMs by the number of programs deemed correct via incoherence.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI'26 (extended version). 8 pages + refs and appendix</p></details> |
| **[Hulls of Free Linear Codes over a Non-Unital Ring](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12335v1)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates the hull codes of free linear codes over a non-unital ring $ E= \langle κ,τ\mid 2 κ=2 τ=0,~ κ^2=κ,~ τ^2=τ,~ κτ=κ,~ τκ=τ\rangle$. Initially, we examine the residue and torsion codes of various hulls of $E$-linear codes and obtain an explicit form of the generator matrix of the hull of a free $E$-linear code. Then, we propose four build-up construction methods to construct codes with a larger length and hull-rank from codes with a smaller length and hull-rank. Some illustrative examples are also given to support our build-up construction methods. Subsequently, we study the permutation equivalence of two free $E$-linear codes and discuss the hull-variation problem. As an application, we classify optimal free $E$-linear codes for lengths up to $8$.</p></details> | 20 |
| **[Taint-Based Code Slicing for LLMs-based Malicious NPM Package Detection](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12313v1)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The increasing sophistication of malware attacks in the npm ecosystem, characterized by obfuscation and complex logic, necessitates advanced detection methods. Recently, researchers have turned their attention from traditional detection approaches to Large Language Models (LLMs) due to their strong capabilities in semantic code understanding. However, while LLMs offer superior semantic reasoning for code analysis, their practical application is constrained by limited context windows and high computational cost. This paper addresses this challenge by introducing a novel framework that leverages code slicing techniques for an LLM-based malicious package detection task. We propose a specialized taintbased slicing technique for npm packages, augmented by a heuristic backtracking mechanism to accurately capture malicious data flows across asynchronous, event-driven patterns (e.g., callbacks and Promises) that elude traditional analysis. An evaluation on a dataset of more than 5000 malicious and benign npm packages demonstrates that our approach isolates security-relevant code, reducing input volume by over 99% while preserving critical behavioral semantics. Using the DeepSeek-Coder-6.7B model as the classification engine, our approach achieves a detection accuracy of 87.04%, substantially outperforming a naive token-splitting baseline (75.41%) and a traditional static-analysis-based approach. These results indicate that semantically optimized input representation via code slicing not only mitigates the LLM context-window bottleneck but also significantly enhances reasoning precision for security tasks, providing an efficient and effective defense against evolving malicious open-source packages.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 4 figures, 9 tables</p></details> |
| **[Training Versatile Coding Agents in Synthetic Environments](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12216v1)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prior works on training software engineering agents have explored utilizing existing resources such as issues on GitHub repositories to construct software engineering tasks and corresponding test suites. These approaches face two key limitations: (1) their reliance on pre-existing GitHub repositories offers limited flexibility, and (2) their primary focus on issue resolution tasks restricts their applicability to the much wider variety of tasks a software engineer must handle. To overcome these challenges, we introduce SWE-Playground, a novel pipeline for generating environments and trajectories which supports the training of versatile coding agents. Unlike prior efforts, SWE-Playground synthetically generates projects and tasks from scratch with strong language models and agents, eliminating reliance on external data sources. This allows us to tackle a much wider variety of coding tasks, such as reproducing issues by generating unit tests and implementing libraries from scratch. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach on three distinct benchmarks, and results indicate that SWE-Playground produces trajectories with dense training signal, enabling agents to reach comparable performance with significantly fewer trajectories than previous works.</p></details> |  |
| **[Citation-Grounded Code Comprehension: Preventing LLM Hallucination Through Hybrid Retrieval and Graph-Augmented Context](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12117v1)** | 2025-12-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have become essential tools for code comprehension, enabling developers to query unfamiliar codebases through natural language interfaces. However, LLM hallucination, generating plausible but factually incorrect citations to source code, remains a critical barrier to reliable developer assistance. This paper addresses the challenges of achieving verifiable, citation grounded code comprehension through hybrid retrieval and lightweight structural reasoning. Our work is grounded in systematic evaluation across 30 Python repositories with 180 developer queries, comparing retrieval modalities, graph expansion strategies, and citation verification mechanisms. We find that challenges of citation accuracy arise from the interplay between sparse lexical matching, dense semantic similarity, and cross file architectural dependencies. Among these, cross file evidence discovery is the largest contributor to citation completeness, but it is largely overlooked because existing systems rely on pure textual similarity without leveraging code structure. We advocate for citation grounded generation as an architectural principle for code comprehension systems and demonstrate this need by achieving 92 percent citation accuracy with zero hallucinations. Specifically, we develop a hybrid retrieval system combining BM25 sparse matching, BGE dense embeddings, and Neo4j graph expansion via import relationships, which outperforms single mode baselines by 14 to 18 percentage points while discovering cross file evidence missed by pure text similarity in 62 percent of architectural queries.</p></details> |  |
| **[GraphPerf-RT: A Graph-Driven Performance Model for Hardware-Aware Scheduling of OpenMP Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12091v1)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Performance prediction for OpenMP workloads on heterogeneous embedded SoCs is challenging due to complex interactions between task DAG structure, control-flow irregularity, cache and branch behavior, and thermal dynamics; classical heuristics struggle under workload irregularity, tabular regressors discard structural information, and model-free RL risks overheating resource-constrained devices. We introduce GraphPerf-RT, the first surrogate that unifies task DAG topology, CFG-derived code semantics, and runtime context (per-core DVFS, thermal state, utilization) in a heterogeneous graph representation with typed edges encoding precedence, placement, and contention. Multi-task evidential heads predict makespan, energy, cache and branch misses, and utilization with calibrated uncertainty (Normal-Inverse-Gamma), enabling risk-aware scheduling that filters low-confidence rollouts. We validate GraphPerf-RT on three embedded ARM platforms (Jetson TX2, Jetson Orin NX, RUBIK Pi), achieving R^2 > 0.95 with well-calibrated uncertainty (ECE < 0.05). To demonstrate end-to-end scheduling utility, we integrate the surrogate with four RL methods on Jetson TX2: single-agent model-free (SAMFRL), single-agent model-based (SAMBRL), multi-agent model-free (MAMFRL-D3QN), and multi-agent model-based (MAMBRL-D3QN). Experiments across 5 seeds (200 episodes each) show that MAMBRL-D3QN with GraphPerf-RT as the world model achieves 66% makespan reduction (0.97 +/- 0.35s) and 82% energy reduction (0.006 +/- 0.005J) compared to model-free baselines, demonstrating that accurate, uncertainty-aware surrogates enable effective model-based planning on thermally constrained embedded systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>36 pa...</summary><p>36 pages, 1 figure, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[Pinball: A Cryogenic Predecoder for Surface Code Decoding Under Circuit-Level Noise](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09807v2)** | 2025-12-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scaling fault tolerant quantum computers, especially cryogenic systems based on the surface code, to millions of qubits is challenging due to poorly-scaling data processing and power consumption overheads. One key hurdle is the design of real-time quantum error correction (QEC) decoders, which demands high data rates for error processing; this is particularly apparent in systems with cryogenic qubits and room temperature (RT) decoders. In response, cryogenic predecoding using lightweight logic has been proposed to handle sparse errors in the cryogenic domain. However, prior work only accounts for a subset of error sources in real-world quantum systems with limited accuracy, often degrading performance below useful levels in practical scenarios. Moreover, prior reliance on SFQ logic precludes detailed architecture-technology co-optimization. To address these limitations, this paper introduces Pinball, a comprehensive design in cryogenic CMOS of a QEC predecoder for the surface code tailored to realistic, circuit-level noise. By accounting for error generation and propagation through QEC circuits, our design achieves higher predecoding accuracy, outperforming logical error rates (LER) of the current state-of-the-art (SOTA) cryogenic predecoder by nearly six orders of magnitude. Remarkably, despite operating under much stricter power and area constraints, Pinball also reduces LER by 32.58x and 5x, respectively, compared to SOTA RT predecoder and RT ensemble configurations. By increasing cryogenic coverage, we also reduce syndrome bandwidth up to 3780.72x. Through co-design with 4 K-characterized 22nm FDSOI technology, we achieve peak power consumption under 0.56 mW. Voltage/frequency scaling and body biasing enable 22.2x lower typical power consumption, yielding up to 67.4x total energy savings. Assuming a 1.5 W 4 K power budget, our predecoder supports up to 2,668 logical qubits at d=21.</p></details> | <details><summary>Minor...</summary><p>Minor text/figure/title updates. 17 pages, 26 figures.

| **[A Solver-in-the-Loop Framework for Improving LLMs on Answer Set Programming for Logic Puzzle Solving](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.17093v1)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) has sparked interest in coding assistants. While general-purpose programming languages are well supported, generating code for domain-specific languages remains a challenging problem for LLMs. In this paper, we focus on the LLM-based generation of code for Answer Set Programming (ASP), a particularly effective approach for finding solutions to combinatorial search problems. The effectiveness of LLMs in ASP code generation is currently hindered by the limited number of examples seen during their initial pre-training phase. In this paper, we introduce a novel ASP-solver-in-the-loop approach for solver-guided instruction-tuning of LLMs to addressing the highly complex semantic parsing task inherent in ASP code generation. Our method only requires problem specifications in natural language and their solutions. Specifically, we sample ASP statements for program continuations from LLMs for unriddling logic puzzles. Leveraging the special property of declarative ASP programming that partial encodings increasingly narrow down the solution space, we categorize them into chosen and rejected instances based on solver feedback. We then apply supervised fine-tuning to train LLMs on the curated data and further improve robustness using a solver-guided search that includes best-of-N sampling. Our experiments demonstrate consistent improvements in two distinct prompting settings on two datasets.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 7 figures, accepted at AAAI'26</p></details> |
| **[Input Reduction Enhanced LLM-based Program Repair](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.15251v2)** | 2025-12-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown great potential in Automated Program Repair (APR). Test inputs, being crucial for reasoning the root cause of failures, are always included in the prompt for LLM-based APR. Unfortunately, LLMs struggle to retain key information in long prompts. When the test inputs are extensive in the prompt, this may trigger the "lost-in-the-middle" issue, compromising repair performance. ReduceFix prompts an LLM to generate a reducer that minimizes failure-inducing test inputs without human effort, and then feeds the reduced failure-inducing inputs to guide patch generation. For targeted evaluation, we constructed LFTBench, the first long-input APR benchmark with 200 real bugs from 20 programming tasks, each paired with a failure-inducing input whose median size is 1 MB. On this benchmark, ReduceFix shrinks inputs by 89.1% on average and improves overall pass@10 by up to 53.8% relative to a prompt that includes the original test, and by 17.6% compared with omitting the test entirely. Adding the same reduction step to ChatRepair and CREF increases their fix rate by 21.3% and 2.6%, respectively, without other changes. Our gains hold against a ddmin-only reducing template baseline and transfer to repository-level OSS-Fuzz cases. Ablation studies further highlight the impact of input length and compressed failure information on repair success. These results underscore that automatically reducing failing inputs is a practical and powerful complement to LLM-based APR, significantly improving its scalability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[SnapClass: An AI-Enhanced Classroom Management System for Block-Based Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.15825v1)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Block-Based Programming (BBP) platforms, such as Snap!, have become increasingly prominent in K-12 computer science education due to their ability to simplify programming concepts and foster computational thinking from an early age. While these platforms engage students through visual and gamified interfaces, teachers often face challenges in using them effectively and finding all the necessary features for classroom management. To address these challenges, we introduce SnapClass, a classroom management system integrated within the Snap! programming environment. SnapClass was iteratively developed drawing on established research about the pedagogical and logistical challenges teachers encounter in computing classrooms. Specifically, SnapClass allows educators to create and customize block-based coding assignments based on student skill levels, implement rubric-based auto-grading, and access student code history and recovery features. It also supports monitoring student engagement and idle time, and includes a help dashboard with a raise hand feature to assist students in real time. This paper describes the design and key features of SnapClass those are developed and those are under progress.</p></details> | 2 pages, 7 figures |
| **[EvoLattice: Persistent Internal-Population Evolution through Multi-Alternative Quality-Diversity Graph Representations for LLM-Guided Program Discovery](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13857v2)** | 2025-12-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly used to evolve programs and multi-agent systems, yet most existing approaches rely on overwrite-based mutations that maintain only a single candidate at a time. Such methods discard useful variants, suffer from destructive edits, and explore a brittle search space prone to structural failure. We introduce EvoLattice, a framework that represents an entire population of candidate programs or agent behaviors within a single directed acyclic graph. Each node stores multiple persistent alternatives, and every valid path through the graph defines a distinct executable candidate, yielding a large combinatorial search space without duplicating structure. EvoLattice enables fine-grained alternative-level evaluation by scoring each alternative across all paths in which it appears, producing statistics that reveal how local design choices affect global performance. These statistics provide a dense, data-driven feedback signal for LLM-guided mutation, recombination, and pruning, while preserving successful components. Structural correctness is guaranteed by a deterministic self-repair mechanism that enforces acyclicity and dependency consistency independently of the LLM. EvoLattice naturally extends to agent evolution by interpreting alternatives as prompt fragments or sub-agent behaviors. Across program synthesis (proxy and optimizer meta-learning), EvoLattice yields more stable evolution, greater expressivity, and stronger improvement trajectories than prior LLM-guided methods. The resulting dynamics resemble quality-diversity optimization, emerging implicitly from EvoLattice's internal multi-alternative representation rather than an explicit external archive.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sharing State Between Prompts and Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14805v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rise of large language models (LLMs) has introduced a new type of programming: natural language programming. By writing prompts that direct LLMs to perform natural language processing, code generation, reasoning, etc., users are writing code in natural language -- natural language code -- for the LLM to execute. An emerging area of research enables interoperability between natural language code and formal languages such as Python. We present a novel programming abstraction, shared program state, that removes the manual work required to enable interoperability between natural language code and program state. With shared program state, programmers can write natural code that directly writes program variables, computes with program objects, and implements control flow in the program. We present a schema for specifying natural function interfaces that extend programming systems to support natural code and leverage this schema to specify shared program state as a natural function interface. We implement shared program state in the Nightjar programming system. Nightjar enables programmers to write Python programs that contain natural code that shares the Python program state. We show that Nightjar programs achieve comparable or higher task accuracy than manually written implementations (+4-19%), while decreasing the lines of code by 39.6% on average. The tradeoff to using Nightjar is that it may incur runtime overhead (0.4-4.3x runtime of manual implementations).</p></details> |  |
| **[A Recursive Theory of Variational State Estimation: The Dynamic Programming Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.11497v2)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this article, variational state estimation is examined from the dynamic programming perspective. This leads to two different value functional recursions depending on whether backward or forward dynamic programming is employed. The result is a theory of variational state estimation that corresponds to the classical theory of Bayesian state estimation. More specifically, in the backward method, the value functional corresponds to a likelihood that is upper bounded by the state likelihood from the Bayesian backward recursion. In the forward method, the value functional corresponds to an unnormalized density that is upper bounded by the unnormalized filtering density. Both methods can be combined to arrive at a variational two-filter formula. Additionally, it is noted that optimal variational filtering is generally of quadratic time-complexity in the sequence length. This motivates the notion of sub-optimal variational filtering, which also lower bounds the evidence but is of linear time-complexity. Another problem is the fact that the value functional recursions are generally intractable. This is briefly discussed and a simple approximation is suggested that retrieves the filter proposed by Courts et. al (2021).The methodology is examined in (i) a jump Gauss-Markov system under a certain factored Markov process approximation, and (ii) in a Gauss-Markov model with log-polynomial likelihoods under a Gauss--Markov constraint on the variational approximation. It is demonstrated that the value functional recursions are tractable in both cases. The resulting estimators are examined in simulation studies and are found to be of adequate quality in comparison to sensible baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Visual Programming for Visual Reasoning via Probabilistic Graphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.14257v1)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, Visual Programming (VP) based on large language models (LLMs) has rapidly developed and demonstrated significant potential in complex Visual Reasoning (VR) tasks. Previous works to enhance VP have primarily focused on improving the quality of LLM-generated visual programs. However, they have neglected to optimize the VP-invoked pre-trained models, which serve as modules for the visual sub-tasks decomposed from the targeted tasks by VP. The difficulty is that there are only final labels of targeted VR tasks rather than labels of sub-tasks. Besides, the non-differentiable nature of VP impedes the direct use of efficient gradient-based optimization methods to leverage final labels for end-to-end learning of the entire VP framework. To overcome these issues, we propose EVPG, a method to Enhance Visual Programming for visual reasoning via Probabilistic Graphs. Specifically, we creatively build a directed probabilistic graph according to the variable dependency relationships during the VP executing process, which reconstructs the non-differentiable VP executing process into a differentiable exact probability inference process on this directed probabilistic graph. As a result, this enables the VP framework to utilize the final labels for efficient, gradient-based optimization in end-to-end supervised learning on targeted VR tasks. Extensive and comprehensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of our EVPG, showing significant performance improvements for VP on three classical complex VR tasks: GQA, NLVRv2, and Open Images.</p></details> | 13 Pages, 12 figures |
| **[Efficient Local and Tabu Search Strategies for Large-Scale Quadratic Integer Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2409.14176v3)** | 2025-12-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study investigates the area of general quadratic integer programming (QIP), encompassing both unconstrained (UQIP) and constrained (CQIP) variants. These NP-hard problems have far-reaching applications, yet the non-convex cases have received limited attention in the literature. To address this gap, we introduce a closed-form formula for single-variable changes, establishing novel necessary and sufficient conditions for 1-Opt local improvement in UQIP and CQIP. We develop a simple local and sophisticated tabu search with an oscillation strategy tailored for large-scale problems. Experimental results on instances with up to 8000 variables demonstrate the efficiency of these strategies, producing high-quality solutions within a short time. Our approaches significantly outperform the Gurobi 11.0.2 solver.</p></details> | 32 pages, 8 figures |

Applications of TTE to emulate cluster randomized trials (RCTs) have been limited. This study explored how to integrate simulation-guided design into the TTE framework to inform planning of a non-randomized cluster trial. Methods: We performed simulations to prospectively plan data collection of a non-randomized study emulating a village-level cluster RCT when cluster-randomization was infeasible. The planned study will assess the impact of mass distribution of nutritional supplements embedded within an existing immunization program to improve pentavalent vaccination rates among children 12-24 months old in Niger. The design included covariate-constrained random selection of villages for outcome ascertainment at follow-up. Simulations used baseline census data on pentavalent vaccination rates and cluster-level covariates to compare the type I error rate and power of four statistical methods: beta-regression; quasi-binomial regression; inverse probability of treatment weighting (IPTW); and naive Wald test. Results: Of the four analytic methods considered, only IPTW and beta-regression controlled the type I error rate at 0.05, but IPTW yielded poor statistical power. Beta-regression that showed adequate statistical power was chosen as our primary analysis. Conclusions: Adopting simulation-guided design principles within TTE can enable robust planning of a group-level non-randomized study emulating a cluster RCT. Lessons from this study also apply to TTE planning of individually-RCTs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Context Branching for LLM Conversations: A Version Control Approach to Exploratory Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13914v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have become integral to software engineering workflows, yet their effectiveness degrades significantly in multi-turn conversations. Recent studies demonstrate an average 39% performance drop when instructions are delivered across multiple turns, with models making premature assumptions and failing to course correct (Laban et al., 2025). This degradation is particularly problematic in exploratory programming tasks where developers need to investigate alternative approaches without committing to a single path. Current solutions force users into a false dichotomy: continue in a context-polluted conversation where the LLM becomes increasingly confused, or start fresh and lose all accumulated context. We present ContextBranch, a conversation management system that applies version control semantics to LLM interactions. ContextBranch provides four core primitives--checkpoint, branch, switch, and inject--enabling users to capture conversation state, explore alternatives in isolation, and selectively merge insights. We evaluate ContextBranch through a controlled experiment with 30 software engineering scenarios featuring intentionally polluting explorations. Branched conversations achieved higher response quality compared to linear conversations, with large improvements in focus and context awareness. Benefits were concentrated in complex scenarios involving conceptually distant explorations. Branching reduced context size by 58.1% (31.0 to 13.0 messages), eliminating irrelevant exploratory content. Our work establishes conversation branching as a fundamental primitive for AI-assisted exploratory work, demonstrating that isolation prevents context pollution when exploring alternatives.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 4 figures, 2 tables, 1 code snippet, 4 algorithms</p></details> |
| **[OPTIMA: Optimal One-shot Pruning for LLMs via Quadratic Programming Reconstruction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13886v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Post-training model pruning is a promising solution, yet it faces a trade-off: simple heuristics that zero weights are fast but degrade accuracy, while principled joint optimization methods recover accuracy but are computationally infeasible at modern scale. One-shot methods such as SparseGPT offer a practical trade-off in optimality by applying efficient, approximate heuristic weight updates. To close this gap, we introduce OPTIMA, a practical one-shot post-training pruning method that balances accuracy and scalability. OPTIMA casts layer-wise weight reconstruction after mask selection as independent, row-wise Quadratic Programs (QPs) that share a common layer Hessian. Solving these QPs yields the per-row globally optimal update with respect to the reconstruction objective given the estimated Hessian. The shared-Hessian structure makes the problem highly amenable to batching on accelerators. We implement an accelerator-friendly QP solver that accumulates one Hessian per layer and solves many small QPs in parallel, enabling one-shot post-training pruning at scale on a single accelerator without fine-tuning. OPTIMA integrates with existing mask selectors and consistently improves zero-shot performance across multiple LLM families and sparsity regimes, yielding up to 3.97% absolute accuracy improvement. On an NVIDIA H100, OPTIMA prunes a 8B-parameter transformer end-to-end in 40 hours with 60GB peak memory. Together, these results set a new state-of-the-art accuracy-efficiency trade-offs for one-shot post-training pruning.</p></details> |  |

(2025), this paper proposes FLARE v2 as a recursive, semiotically informed account of how program meaning can be described across abstraction scales in common teaching languages. It reframes FLARE v1's tiers as one cycle: identify bounded elements (Receives, Sends, Effects, Shares), analyse bindings along two dimensions (Causal-Temporal and Communicative), and treat the bound set as a new element at the next scale. Causal-Temporal binding has three subtypes - Sequential, Branch, and Event - to distinguish user-authored control flow from event-driven control whose dispatch is hidden in the runtime. A Compositional Ladder visualises the same compositional move from blocks and statements through segments and systems. FLARE v2 is scoped to imperative and event-driven environments typical of primary and lower-secondary curricula. Above the system layer, behaviour is increasingly shaped by interaction between code and operating context (scheduling, infrastructure, permissions, contracts, failures, platform policy). Here, the element-and-binding vocabulary remains a structural baseline, but continuity of explanation typically requires overlays that make environmental constraints explicit. Event binding and overlays serve a common pedagogical role - preserving coherent structural reasoning where key causal mechanisms are not fully visible in the authored artefact. OOP design reasoning, explicit concurrency models, distributed systems, and functional paradigms are treated as future extensions; implementation and evaluation are left for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 4 figures.

| **[Scaling Laws for Code: Every Programming Language Matters](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13472v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code large language models (Code LLMs) are powerful but costly to train, with scaling laws predicting performance from model size, data, and compute. However, different programming languages (PLs) have varying impacts during pre-training that significantly affect base model performance, leading to inaccurate performance prediction. Besides, existing works focus on language-agnostic settings, neglecting the inherently multilingual nature of modern software development. Therefore, it is first necessary to investigate the scaling laws of different PLs, and then consider their mutual influences to arrive at the final multilingual scaling law. In this paper, we present the first systematic exploration of scaling laws for multilingual code pre-training, conducting over 1000+ experiments (Equivalent to 336,000+ H800 hours) across multiple PLs, model sizes (0.2B to 14B parameters), and dataset sizes (1T tokens). We establish comprehensive scaling laws for code LLMs across multiple PLs, revealing that interpreted languages (e.g., Python) benefit more from increased model size and data than compiled languages (e.g., Rust). The study demonstrates that multilingual pre-training provides synergistic benefits, particularly between syntactically similar PLs. Further, the pre-training strategy of the parallel pairing (concatenating code snippets with their translations) significantly enhances cross-lingual abilities with favorable scaling properties. Finally, a proportion-dependent multilingual scaling law is proposed to optimally allocate training tokens by prioritizing high-utility PLs (e.g., Python), balancing high-synergy pairs (e.g., JavaScript-TypeScript), and reducing allocation to fast-saturating languages (Rust), achieving superior average performance across all PLs compared to uniform distribution under the same compute budget.</p></details> |  |
| **[Probabilistic Programming Meets Automata Theory: Exact Inference using Weighted Automata](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.13185v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Probabilistic programs encode stochastic models as ordinary-looking programs with primitives for sampling numbers from predefined distributions and conditioning. Their applications include, among many others, machine learning and modeling of autonomous systems. The analysis of probabilistic programs is often quantitative - it involves reasoning about numerical properties like probabilities and expectations. A particularly important quantitative property of probabilistic programs is their posterior distribution, i.e., the distribution over possible outputs for a given input (or prior) distribution. Computing the posterior distribution exactly is known as exact inference. We present our current research using weighted automata, a generalization of the well-known finite automata, for performing exact inference in a restricted class of discrete probabilistic programs. This is achieved by encoding distributions over program variables - possibly with infinite support - as certain weighted automata. The semantics of our programming language then corresponds to common automata-theoretic constructions, such as product, concatenation, and others.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Optimize for Mixed-Integer Non-linear Programming with Feasibility Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11061v10)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs) arise in domains such as energy systems, process engineering, and transportation, and are notoriously difficult to solve at scale due to the interplay of discrete decisions and nonlinear constraints. In many practical settings, these problems appear in parametric form, where objectives and constraints depend on instance-specific parameters, creating the need for fast and reliable solutions across related instances. While learning-to-optimize (L2O) methods have shown strong performance in continuous optimization, extending them to MINLPs requires enforcing both feasibility and integrality within a data-driven framework. We propose an L2O approach tailored to parametric MINLPs that generates instance-specific solutions using integer correction layers to enforce integrality and a gradient-based projection to ensure feasibility of the inequality constraints. Theoretically, we provide asymptotic and non-asymptotic convergence guarantees of the projection step. Empirically, the framework scales to MINLPs with tens of thousands of variables and produces feasible high-quality solutions within milliseconds, often outperforming traditional solvers and heuristic baselines in repeated-solve settings.</p></details> |  |
| **[Satisfiability Modulo Theory Meets Inductive Logic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12918v1)** | 2025-12-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Inductive Logic Programming (ILP) provides interpretable rule learning in relational domains, yet remains limited in its ability to induce and reason with numerical constraints. Classical ILP systems operate over discrete predicates and typically rely on discretisation or hand-crafted numerical predicates, making it difficult to infer thresholds or arithmetic relations that must hold jointly across examples. Recent work has begun to address these limitations through tighter integrations of ILP with Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) or specialised numerical inference mechanisms. In this paper we investigate a modular alternative that couples the ILP system PyGol with the SMT solver Z3. Candidate clauses proposed by PyGol are interpreted as quantifier-free formulas over background theories such as linear or nonlinear real arithmetic, allowing numerical parameters to be instantiated and verified by the SMT solver while preserving ILP's declarative relational bias. This supports the induction of hybrid rules that combine symbolic predicates with learned numerical constraints, including thresholds, intervals, and multi-literal arithmetic relations. We formalise this SMT-ILP setting and evaluate it on a suite of synthetic datasets designed to probe linear, relational, nonlinear, and multi-hop reasoning. The results illustrate how a modular SMT-ILP architecture can extend the expressivity of symbolic rule learning, complementing prior numerical ILP approaches while providing a flexible basis for future extensions toward richer theory-aware induction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Interactive Program Synthesis for Modeling Collaborative Physical Activities from Narrated Demonstrations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24250v2)** | 2025-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Teaching systems physical tasks is a long standing goal in HCI, yet most prior work has focused on non collaborative physical activities. Collaborative tasks introduce added complexity, requiring systems to infer users assumptions about their teammates intent, which is an inherently ambiguous and dynamic process. This necessitates representations that are interpretable and correctable, enabling users to inspect and refine system behavior. We address this challenge by framing collaborative task learning as a program synthesis problem. Our system represents behavior as editable programs and uses narrated demonstrations, i.e. paired physical actions and natural language, as a unified modality for teaching, inspecting, and correcting system logic without requiring users to see or write code. The same modality is used for the system to communicate its learning to users. In a within subjects study, 20 users taught multiplayer soccer tactics to our system. 70 percent (14/20) of participants successfully refined learned programs to match their intent and 90 percent (18/20) found it easy to correct the programs. The study surfaced unique challenges in representing learning as programs and in enabling users to teach collaborative physical activities. We discuss these issues and outline mitigation strategies.</p></details> |  |

We view an optimizer as a short program over a small vocabulary of search operators and learn this operator program separately for each problem instance. We instantiate this idea in Operator-Programmed Algorithms (OPAL), a landscape-aware framework for continuous black-box optimization that uses a small design budget with a standard differential evolution baseline to probe the landscape, builds a $k$-nearest neighbor graph over sampled points, and encodes this trajectory with a graph neural network. A meta-learner then maps the resulting representation to a phase-wise schedule of exploration, restart, and local search operators. On the CEC~2017 test suite, a single meta-trained OPAL policy is statistically competitive with state-of-the-art adaptive differential evolution variants and achieves significant improvements over simpler baselines under nonparametric tests. Ablation studies on CEC~2017 justify the choices for the design phase, the trajectory graph, and the operator-program representation, while the meta-components add only modest wall-clock overhead. Overall, the results indicate that operator-programmed, landscape-aware per-instance design is a practical way forward beyond ad hoc metaphor-based algorithms in black-box optimization.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sourc...</summary><p>Source code, experiment scripts, and results are publicly available at https://github.com/junbolian/OPAL.

| **[High Order Control Lyapunov Function - Control Barrier Function - Quadratic Programming Based Autonomous Driving Controller for Bicyclist Safety](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.12776v1)** | 2025-12-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Ensuring the safety of Vulnerable Road Users (VRUs) is a critical challenge in the development of advanced autonomous driving systems in smart cities. Among vulnerable road users, bicyclists present unique characteristics that make their safety both critical and also manageable. Vehicles often travel at significantly higher relative speeds when interacting with bicyclists as compared to their interactions with pedestrians which makes collision avoidance system design for bicyclist safety more challenging. Yet, bicyclist movements are generally more predictable and governed by clear traffic rules as compared to the sudden and sometimes erratic pedestrian motion, offering opportunities for model-based control strategies. To address bicyclist safety in complex traffic environments, this study proposes and develops a High Order Control Lyapunov Function High Order Control Barrier Function Quadratic Programming (HOCLF HOCBF QP) control framework. Through this framework, CLFs constraints guarantee system stability so that the vehicle can track its reference trajectory, whereas CBFs constraints ensure system safety by letting vehicle avoiding potential collisions region with surrounding obstacles. Then by solving a QP problem, an optimal control command that simultaneously satisfies stability and safety requirements can be calculated. Three key bicyclist crash scenarios recorded in the Fatality Analysis Reporting System (FARS) are recreated and used to comprehensively evaluate the proposed autonomous driving bicyclist safety control strategy in a simulation study. Simulation results demonstrate that the HOCLF HOCBF QP controller can help the vehicle perform robust, and collision-free maneuvers, highlighting its potential for improving bicyclist safety in complex traffic environments.</p></details> |  |

While machine learning and Large Language Models (LLMs) offer promising solutions, their effectiveness is limited by the way they interpret data. Unlike natural language, source code meaning is defined less by token adjacency and more by complex, long-range, and structural relationships and dependencies. This limitation is especially pronounced for C and C++, where flatter syntactic hierarchies, pointer aliasing, multi-level indirection, typedef-based type obfuscation, and function-pointer calls hinder accurate static analysis. To address these challenges, this paper introduces ATLAS, a Python-based Command-Line Interface (CLI) that (i) generates statement-level Control Flow Graphs (CFG) and type-aware Data Flow Graphs (DFG) that capture inter-functional dependencies for the entire program; (ii) has the ability to work on entire C and C++ projects comprising multiple files; (iii) works on both compilable and non-compilable code and (iv) produces a unified multi-view code representation using Abstract Syntax Trees (AST), CFG and DFG. By preserving essential structural and semantic information, ATLAS provides a practical foundation for improving downstream SE and machine-learning-based program understanding.

Educators such as speech-language pathologists (SLPs) address this instructional gap by using an inquiry-based approach to teach spelling that targets the phonology, morphology, meaning, and etymology of words. Yet, these strategies rarely appear in everyday writing tools, which simply detect and autocorrect errors. We introduce SPIRE (Spelling Inquiry Engine), a spell check system that brings this inquiry-based pedagogy into the act of composition. SPIRE implements Pedagogical Program Synthesis, a novel approach for operationalizing the inherently dynamic pedagogy of spelling instruction. SPIRE represents SLP instructional moves in a domain-specific language, synthesizes tailored programs in real-time from learner errors, and renders them as interactive interfaces for inquiry-based interventions. With SPIRE, spelling errors become opportunities to explore word meanings, word structures, morphological families, word origins, and grapheme-phoneme correspondences, supporting metalinguistic reasoning alongside correction. Evaluation with SLPs and learners shows alignment with professional practice and potential for integration into writing workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 6 Figures, 4 Tables</p></details> |

We introduce solvable tuple patterns (STPs) and conjunctive STPs (CSTPs), novel formalisms for expressing and inferring invariants between list-like recursive data structures. A distinguishing feature of STPs is that they can be efficiently inferred from only a small number of positive samples; no negative samples are required. After presenting properties and inference algorithms of STPs and CSTPs, we show how to incorporate the CSTP inference into a CHC (Constrained Horn Clauses) solver supporting list-like data structures, which serves as a uniform backend for automated program verification tools. A CHC solver incorporating the (C)STP inference has won the ADT-LIN category of CHC-COMP 2025 by a significant margin.</p></details> |  |

However, the relative impact of these methods during the learning and post-learning phases remains unclear. In this work, we present a large-scale study comparing the effectiveness of various intervention methods in elementary programming both during learning and on novel tasks post-learning. Specifically, we compare three intervention methods: code-edit recommendations (Code-Rec), quizzes based on code edits (Code-Quiz), and quizzes based on metacognitive strategies (Plan-Quiz), along with a no-intervention control (group None). A total of 398 students (across grades 4-7) participated in a two-phase study: learning phase comprising write-code tasks from the Hour of Code: Maze Challenge with the intervention, followed by a post-learning phase comprising more advanced write-code tasks without any intervention. All intervention methods significantly improved learning performance over the control group while preserving students' problem-solving skills in the post-learning phase. Quiz-based methods further improved performance on novel post-learning tasks. Students in intervention groups also reported greater engagement and perceived skill growth.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[AgentProg: Empowering Long-Horizon GUI Agents with Program-Guided Context Management](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10371v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid development of mobile GUI agents has stimulated growing research interest in long-horizon task automation. However, building agents for these tasks faces a critical bottleneck: the reliance on ever-expanding interaction history incurs substantial context overhead. Existing context management and compression techniques often fail to preserve vital semantic information, leading to degraded task performance. We propose AgentProg, a program-guided approach for agent context management that reframes the interaction history as a program with variables and control flow. By organizing information according to the structure of program, this structure provides a principled mechanism to determine which information should be retained and which can be discarded. We further integrate a global belief state mechanism inspired by Belief MDP framework to handle partial observability and adapt to unexpected environmental changes. Experiments on AndroidWorld and our extended long-horizon task suite demonstrate that AgentProg has achieved the state-of-the-art success rates on these benchmarks. More importantly, it maintains robust performance on long-horizon tasks while baseline methods experience catastrophic degradation. Our system is open-sourced at https://github.com/MobileLLM/AgentProg.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

Prior LLM approaches either rely on brittle prompting or costly retraining with limited generalization. We present AlphaOPT, a self-improving experience library that enables an LLM to learn from limited demonstrations (even answers alone, without gold-standard programs) and solver feedback - without annotated reasoning traces or parameter updates. AlphaOPT operates in a continual two-phase cycle: (i) a Library Learning phase that reflects on failed attempts, extracting solver-verified, structured insights as {taxonomy, condition, explanation, example}; and (ii) a Library Evolution phase that diagnoses retrieval misalignments and refines the applicability conditions of stored insights, improving transfer across tasks. This design (1) learns efficiently from limited demonstrations without curated rationales, (2) expands continually without costly retraining by updating the library rather than model weights, and (3) makes knowledge explicit and interpretable for human inspection and intervention. Experiments show that AlphaOPT steadily improves with more data (65% to 72% from 100 to 300 training items) and surpasses the strongest baseline by 7.7% on the out-of-distribution OptiBench dataset when trained only on answers. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/Minw913/AlphaOPT.</p></details> |  |
| **[SemanticBBV: A Semantic Signature for Cross-Program Knowledge Reuse in Microarchitecture Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10231v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For decades, sampling-based techniques have been the de facto standard for accelerating microarchitecture simulation, with the Basic Block Vector (BBV) serving as the cornerstone program representation. Yet, the BBV's fundamental limitations: order-dependent IDs that prevent cross-program knowledge reuse and a lack of semantic content predictive of hardware performance have left a massive potential for optimization untapped. To address these gaps, we introduce SemanticBBV, a novel, two-stage framework that generates robust, performance-aware signatures for cross-program simulation reuse. First, a lightweight RWKV-based semantic encoder transforms assembly basic blocks into rich Basic Block Embeddings (BBEs), capturing deep functional semantics. Second, an order-invariant Set Transformer aggregates these BBEs, weighted by execution frequency, into a final signature. Crucially, this stage is co-trained with a dual objective: a triplet loss for signature distinctiveness and a Cycles Per Instruction (CPI) regression task, directly imbuing the signature with performance sensitivity. Our evaluation demonstrates that SemanticBBV not only matches traditional BBVs in single-program accuracy but also enables unprecedented cross-program analysis. By simulating just 14 universal program points, we estimated the performance of ten SPEC CPU benchmarks with 86.3% average accuracy, achieving a 7143x simulation speedup. Furthermore, the signature shows strong adaptability to new microarchitectures with minimal fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ASP-DAC 2026 conference</p></details> |

Predict-and-Search methods operate by using a predictive model to estimate promising variable assignments and then guiding a search procedure toward high-quality solutions. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating machine learning (ML) into the Predict-and-Search framework significantly enhances its performance. Still, it is restricted to binary problems and overlooks the presence of fixed variables that commonly arise in practical settings. This work extends the Predict-and-Search (PaS) framework to parametric MIPs and introduces ID-PaS, an identity-aware learning framework that enables the ML model to handle heterogeneous variables more effectively. Experiments on several real-world large-scale problems demonstrate that ID-PaS consistently achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art solver Gurobi and PaS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Hirschberg for Width Bounded Dynamic Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10132v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hirschberg's algorithm (1975) reduces the space complexity for the longest common subsequence problem from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$ via recursive midpoint bisection on a grid dynamic program (DP). We show that the underlying idea generalizes to a broad class of dynamic programs with local dependencies on directed acyclic graphs (DP DAGs). Modeling a DP as deterministic time evolution over a topologically ordered DAG with frontier width $ω$ and bounded in-degree, and assuming a max-type semiring with deterministic tie breaking, we prove that in a standard offline random-access model any such DP admits deterministic traceback in space $O(ω\log T + (\log T)^{O(1)})$ cells over a fixed finite alphabet, where $T$ is the number of states. Our construction replaces backward dynamic programs by forward-only recomputation and organizes the time order into a height-compressed recursion tree whose nodes expose small "middle frontiers'' across which every optimal path must pass. The framework yields near-optimal traceback bounds for asymmetric and banded sequence alignment, one-dimensional recurrences, and dynamic-programming formulations on graphs of bounded pathwidth. We also show that an $Ω(ω)$ space term (in bits) is unavoidable in forward single-pass models and discuss conjectured $\sqrt{T}$-type barriers in streaming settings, supporting the view that space-efficient traceback is a structural property of width-bounded DP DAGs rather than a peculiarity of grid-based algorithms.</p></details> | 31 pages |

Human visual attention refers to the mechanical processes by which we selectively process and prioritize information. Visual attention is important to study because it is central to what information people (who are sighted) use to solve a particular problem. Meanwhile, memory bugs are among the most common types of bugs in C programs that manifest as a variety of program faults. In this paper, we study human visual attention while people attempt to locate memory bugs in code. We recruit 21 programmers to locate between one and eight memory bugs in three C programs for 1.5-2 hours each. In total we collected observations of 31 hours of programmer effort. The bugs in our study cover memory leaks, overflows, and double frees, which are among the most common memory bugs. We analyze the task outcomes in terms of success rate and related factors, patterns of visual attention overall such as what lines and functions are read, and finally we explore differences of visual attention patterns during success versus failure cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rule-Based Graph Programs Matching the Time Complexity of Imperative Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09144v3)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report on recent advances in rule-based graph programming, which allow us to match the time complexity of some fundamental imperative graph algorithms. In general, achieving the time complexity of graph algorithms implemented in conventional languages using a rule-based graph-transformation language is challenging due to the cost of graph matching. Previous work demonstrated that with rooted rules, certain algorithms can be implemented in the graph programming language GP 2 such that their runtime matches the time complexity of imperative implementations. However, this required input graphs to have a bounded node degree and (for some algorithms) to be connected. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by enhancing the graph data structure generated by the GP 2 compiler and exploiting the new structure in programs. We present three case studies: the first program checks whether input graphs are connected, the second program checks whether input graphs are acyclic, and the third program solves the single-source shortest-paths problem for graphs with integer edge-weights. The first two programs run in linear time on (possibly disconnected) input graphs with arbitrary node degrees. The third program runs in time $O(nm)$ on arbitrary input graphs, matching the time complexity of imperative implementations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. For each program, we formally prove its correctness and time complexity, and provide runtime experiments on various graph classes.</p></details> | LMCS |
| **[Simple Modal Types for Functional Reactive Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09412v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional reactive programming (FRP) is a declarative programming paradigm for implementing reactive programs at a high level of abstraction. It applies functional programming principles to construct and manipulate time-varying values, also known as signals. However, for this programming paradigm to work in practice, an FRP language must ensure that programs are causal, productive, and free from space leaks. Over the past fifteen years, several modal type systems to enforce these operational properties have been developed. We present a new FRP language with a significantly simplified modal type system that imposes fewer restrictions than previous modal FRP languages while still guaranteeing the central operational properties of causality, productivity, and absence of space leaks. The key enabling idea is to alter the semantics of signals so that the type system can safely allow more programs to type-check, which also makes the language more expressive. With this new semantics, signals are modelled as mutable references whose mutability is tightly controlled by the 'later' type modality. This disciplined form of mutability also enables more efficient in-place updates of signals, all while preserving a functional programming style.</p></details> |  |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for RTL automation, their performance and research focus have overwhelmingly centered on RTL generation rather than verification. Current methods for RTL verification rely on large scale proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) to generate Python-based functional references, incurring a high cost and raising data-privacy risks. To date, an end-to-end open-source solution for autonomous verification remains absent. We introduce PRO-V-R1, the first trainable open-source agentic framework for autonomous RTL verification. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we design PRO-V sys, a modular agentic system that couples LLM-based reasoning with programmatic tool use for RTL verification; (2) we establish a data construction pipeline that leverages existing RTL datasets to build simulation-validated, expert-level trajectories tailored for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) RTL verification agents; and (3) we implement an efficient reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that uses verification-specific rewards derived from program-tool feedback to optimize the end-to-end verification workflow. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates PRO-V-R1 achieves a 57.7% functional correctness rate and 34.0% in robust fault detection, significantly outperforming the base model's 25.7% and 21.8% (respectively) from the state-of-the-art (SOTA) automatic verification system. This configuration also outperforms large-scale proprietary LLMs in functional correctness and shows comparable robustness for fault detection.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art points-to analyses guarantee sound solutions only for complete programs, requiring summary functions to describe any missing program parts. Summary functions are rarely available in production compilers, however, where soundness and efficiency are non-negotiable. This paper presents an Andersen-style points-to analysis that efficiently produces sound solutions for incomplete C programs. The analysis accomplishes soundness by tracking memory locations and pointers that are accessible from external modules, and efficiency by performing this tracking implicitly in the constraint graph. We show that implicit pointee tracking makes the constraint solver 15$\times$ faster than any combination of five different state-of-the-art techniques using explicit pointee tracking. We also present the Prefer Implicit Pointees (PIP) technique that further reduces the use of explicit pointees. PIP gives an additional speedup of 1.9$\times$, compared to the fastest solver configuration not benefiting from PIP. The precision of the analysis is evaluated in terms of an alias-analysis client, where it reduces the number of MayAlias-responses by 40% compared to LLVM's BasicAA pass alone. Finally, we show that the analysis is scalable in terms of memory, making it suitable for optimizing compilers in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures.

We propose a novel framework leveraging Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to evaluate multiple dimensions of fairness-Priority, Access, and Outcome-within a unified model. This approach captures complexities often missed in single-metric analyses. Using data from the United Network for Organ Sharing, we separately quantify fairness across these dimensions: Priority fairness through waitlist durations, Access fairness via the Living Kidney Donor Profile Index (LKDPI) scores, and Outcome fairness based on graft lifespan. We then apply our conditional DEA model with covariate adjustment to demonstrate significant disparities in kidney allocation efficiency across ethnic groups. To quantify uncertainty, we employ conformal prediction within a novel Reference Frontier Mapping (RFM) framework, yielding group-conditional prediction intervals with finite-sample coverage guarantees. Our findings show notable differences in efficiency distributions between ethnic groups. Our study provides a rigorous framework for evaluating fairness in complex resource allocation systems with resource scarcity and mutual compatibility constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[A biconvex optimization for solving semidefinite programs via bilinear factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01198v13)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many problems in machine learning can be reduced to learning a low-rank positive semidefinite matrix (denoted as $Z$), which encounters semidefinite program (SDP). Existing SDP solvers by classical convex optimization are expensive to solve large-scale problems. Employing the low rank of solution, Burer-Monteiro's method reformulated SDP as a nonconvex problem via the {\emph{quadratic}} factorization ($Z$ as $XX^\top$). However, this would lose the structure of problem in optimization. In this paper, we propose to convert SDP into a biconvex problem via the {\emph{bilinear}} factorization ($Z$ as $XY^\top$), and while adding the term $\frac{\g}{2}\normfs{X-Y}$ to penalize the difference of $X$ and $Y$. Thus, the biconvex structure (w.r.t. $X$ and $Y$) can be exploited naturally in optimization. As a theoretical result, we provide a bound to the penalty parameter $\g$ under the assumption of $L$-Lipschitz smoothness and $σ$-strongly biconvexity, such that, at stationary points, the proposed bilinear factorization is equivalent to Burer-Monteiro's factorization when the bound is arrived, that is $\g>\frac{1}{4}(L-σ)_+$. Our proposal opens up a new way to surrogate SDP by biconvex program. Experiments on two SDP-related applications demonstrate that the proposed method is effective as the state-of-the-art.</p></details> |  |

The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation. The inclusion of the ETM ensures that parameter updates of the learning module are executed only when the state deviation surpasses a predefined bound, thereby preventing excessive learning activity and substantially reducing computational load. A Lyapunov-oriented analysis is used to characterize the stability properties of the resulting closed-loop system. Numerical experiments further confirm that the developed approach maintains strong control performance and disturbance tolerance, while achieving a significant reduction in sampling and processing effort compared with standard time-triggered ADP schemes.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 9 figures, 2 numerical examples.

Existing learning-based methods like Neural Two-Stage Stochastic Programming (Neur2SP) employ neural networks (NNs) as recourse function surrogates but rely on computationally intensive mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations. We propose ICNN-enhanced 2SP, a method that leverages Input Convex Neural Networks (ICNNs) to exploit linear programming (LP) representability in convex 2SP problems. By architecturally enforcing convexity and enabling exact inference through LP, our approach eliminates the need for integer variables inherent to the conventional MIP-based formulation while retaining an exact embedding of the ICNN surrogate within the 2SP framework. This results in a more computationally efficient alternative, and we show that good solution quality can be maintained. Comprehensive experiments reveal that ICNNs incur only marginally longer training times while achieving validation accuracy on par with their standard NN counterparts. Across benchmark problems, ICNN-enhanced 2SP often exhibits considerably faster solution times than the MIP-based formulations while preserving solution quality, with these advantages becoming significantly more pronounced as problem scale increases. For the most challenging instances, the method achieves speedups of up to 100$\times$ and solution quality superior to MIP-based formulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Dynamic Programming Theory for Leader-Follower Stochastic Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05667v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leader-follower general-sum stochastic games (LF-GSSGs) model sequential decision-making under asymmetric commitment, where a leader commits to a policy and a follower best responds, yielding a strong Stackelberg equilibrium (SSE) with leader-favourable tie-breaking. This paper introduces a dynamic programming (DP) framework that applies Bellman recursion over credible sets-state abstractions formally representing all rational follower best responses under partial leader commitments-to compute SSEs. We first prove that any LF-GSSG admits a lossless reduction to a Markov decision process (MDP) over credible sets. We further establish that synthesising an optimal memoryless deterministic leader policy is NP-hard, motivating the development of ε-optimal DP algorithms with provable guarantees on leader exploitability. Experiments on standard mixed-motive benchmarks-including security games, resource allocation, and adversarial planning-demonstrate empirical gains in leader value and runtime scalability over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 31 pages, 5 figures |
| **[Feasibility of AI-Assisted Programming for End-User Development](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05666v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>End-user development,where non-programmers create or adapt their own digital tools, can play a key role in driving digital transformation within organizations. Currently, low-code/no-code platforms are widely used to enable end-user development through visual programming, minimizing the need for manual coding. Recent advancements in generative AI, particularly large language model-based assistants and "copilots", open new possibilities, as they may enable end users to generate and refine programming code and build apps directly from natural language prompts. This approach, here referred to as AI-assisted end-user coding, promises greater flexibility, broader applicability, faster development, improved reusability, and reduced vendor lock-in compared to the established visual LCNC platforms. This paper investigates whether AI-assisted end-user coding is a feasible paradigm for end-user development, which may complement or even replace the LCNC model in the future. To explore this, we conducted a case study in which non-programmers were asked to develop a basic web app through interaction with AI assistants.The majority of study participants successfully completed the task in reasonable time and also expressed support for AI-assisted end-user coding as a viable approach for end-user development. The paper presents the study design, analyzes the outcomes, and discusses potential implications for practice, future research, and academic teaching.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |
| **[An Empirical Study on Low-Code Programming using Traditional vs Large Language Model Support](https://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01156v3)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Low-code programming (LCP) refers to programming using models at higher levels of abstraction, resulting in less manual and more efficient programming, and reduced learning effort for amateur developers. Many LCP tools have rapidly evolved and have benefited from the concepts of visual programming languages (VPLs) and programming by demonstration (PBD). With the huge increase in interest in using large language models (LLMs) in software engineering, LLM-based LCP has begun to become increasingly important. However, the technical principles and application scenarios of traditional approaches to LCP and LLM-based LCP are significantly different. Understanding these key differences and characteristics in the application of the two approaches to LCP by users is crucial for LCP providers in improving existing and developing new LCP tools and in better assisting users in choosing the appropriate LCP technology. We conducted an empirical study of both traditional LCP and LLM-based LCP. We analyzed developers' discussions on Stack Overflow (SO) over the past three years and then explored the similarities and differences between traditional LCP and LLM-based LCP features and developer feedback. Our findings reveal that while traditional LCP and LLM-based LCP share common primary usage scenarios, they significantly differ in scope, limitations, and usage throughout the software development lifecycle, particularly during the implementation phase. We also examine how LLMs impact and integrate with LCP, discussing the latest technological developments in LLM-based LCP, such as its integration with VPLs and the application of LLM Agents in software engineering.</p></details> |  |

We propose a novel framework that leverages ASP's declarative nature and logical reasoning capabilities to encode complex security rules as logical predicates. Our ASP-based system was applied to a real-world Linux system log dataset, demonstrating its effectiveness in identifying various anomalies such as potential brute-force attacks, privilege escalations, frequent network connections from specific IPs, and various system-level issues. Key findings highlight ASP's strengths in handling structured log data, rule flexibility, and event correlation. The approach shows promise in providing explainable alerts from real-world data.

| **[On-Policy Optimization with Group Equivalent Preference for Multi-Programming Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12723v3)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance in code generation tasks. However, a significant performance disparity persists between popular programming languages (e.g., Python, C++) and others. To address this capability gap, we leverage the code translation task to train LLMs, thereby facilitating the transfer of coding proficiency across diverse programming languages. Moreover, we introduce OORL for training, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates on-policy and off-policy strategies. Within OORL, on-policy RL is applied during code translation, guided by a rule-based reward signal derived from unit tests. Complementing this coarse-grained rule-based reward, we propose Group Equivalent Preference Optimization (GEPO), a novel preference optimization method. Specifically, GEPO trains the LLM using intermediate representations (IRs) groups. LLMs can be guided to discern IRs equivalent to the source code from inequivalent ones, while also utilizing signals about the mutual equivalence between IRs within the group. This process allows LLMs to capture nuanced aspects of code functionality. By employing OORL for training with code translation tasks, LLMs improve their recognition of code functionality and their understanding of the relationships between code implemented in different languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our OORL for LLMs training with code translation tasks achieves significant performance improvements on code benchmarks across multiple programming languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reflection-Satisfaction Tradeoff: Investigating Impact of Reflection on Student Engagement with AI-Generated Programming Hints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04630v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI tools, such as AI-generated hints, are increasingly integrated into programming education to offer timely, personalized support. However, little is known about how to effectively leverage these hints while ensuring autonomous and meaningful learning. One promising approach involves pairing AI-generated hints with reflection prompts, asking students to review and analyze their learning, when they request hints. This study investigates the interplay between AI-generated hints and different designs of reflection prompts in an online introductory programming course. We conducted a two-trial field experiment. In Trial 1, students were randomly assigned to receive prompts either before or after receiving hints, or no prompt at all. Each prompt also targeted one of three SRL phases: planning, monitoring, and evaluation. In Trial 2, we examined two types of prompt guidance: directed (offering more explicit and structured guidance) and open (offering more general and less constrained guidance). Findings show that students in the before-hint (RQ1), planning (RQ2), and directed (RQ3) prompt groups produced higher-quality reflections but reported lower satisfaction with AI-generated hints than those in other conditions. Immediate performance did not differ across conditions. This negative relationship between reflection quality and hint satisfaction aligns with previous work on student mental effort and satisfaction. Our results highlight the need to reconsider how AI models are trained and evaluated for education, as prioritizing user satisfaction can undermine deeper learning.</p></details> | Preprint |
| **[Algorithms for Boolean Matrix Factorization using Integer Programming and Heuristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03807v2)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Boolean matrix factorization (BMF) approximates a given binary input matrix as the product of two smaller binary factors. Unlike binary matrix factorization based on standard arithmetic, BMF employs the Boolean OR and AND operations for the matrix product, which improves interpretability and reduces the approximation error. It is also used in role mining and computer vision. In this paper, we first propose algorithms for BMF that perform alternating optimization (AO) of the factor matrices, where each subproblem is solved via integer programming (IP). We then design different approaches to further enhance AO-based algorithms by selecting an optimal subset of rank-one factors from multiple runs. To address the scalability limits of IP-based methods, we introduce new greedy and local-search heuristics. We also construct a new C++ data structure for Boolean vectors and matrices that is significantly faster than existing ones and is of independent interest, allowing our heuristics to scale to large datasets. We illustrate the performance of all our proposed methods and compare them with the state of the art on various real datasets, both with and without missing data, including applications in topic modeling and imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 12 tables, 3 figures, 2 typos corrected in v2, code and data available from https://gitlab.com/ckolomvakis/boolean-matrix-factorization-ip-and-heuristics</p></details> |

We present a unified taxonomy that groups 62 recent LLM-based repair systems into four paradigms defined by parameter adaptation and control authority over the repair loop, and overlays two cross-cutting layers for retrieval and analysis augmentation. Prior surveys have either focused on classical software repair techniques, on LLMs in software engineering more broadly, or on subsets of LLM-based software repair, such as fine-tuning strategies or vulnerability repair. We complement these works by treating fine-tuning, prompting, procedural pipelines, and agentic frameworks as first-class paradigms and systematically mapping representative systems to each of these paradigms. We also consolidate evaluation practice on common benchmarks by recording benchmark scope, pass@k, and fault-localization assumptions to support a more meaningful comparison of reported success rates. We clarify trade-offs among paradigms in task alignment, deployment cost, controllability, and ability to repair multi-hunk or cross-file bugs. We discuss challenges in current LLM-based software repair and outline research directions. Our artifacts, including the representation papers and scripted survey pipeline, are publicly available at https://github.com/GLEAM-Lab/ProgramRepair.</p></details> |  |
| **[New Perspectives on Semiring Applications to Dynamic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03916v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semiring algebras have been shown to provide a suitable language to formalize many noteworthy combinatorial problems. For instance, the Shortest-Path problem can be seen as a special case of the Algebraic-Path problem when applied to the tropical semiring. The application of semirings typically makes it possible to solve extended problems without increasing the computational complexity. In this article we further exploit the idea of using semiring algebras to address and tackle several extensions of classical computational problems by dynamic programming. We consider a general approach which allows us to define a semiring extension of any problem with a reasonable notion of a certificate (e.g., an NP problem). This allows us to consider cost variants of these combinatorial problems, as well as their counting extensions where the goal is to determine how many solutions a given problem admits. The approach makes no particular assumptions (such as idempotence) on the semiring structure. We also propose a new associative algebraic operation on semirings, called $Δ$-product, which enables our dynamic programming algorithms to count the number of solutions of minimal costs. We illustrate the advantages of our framework on two well-known but computationally very different NP-hard problems, namely, Connected-Dominating-Set problems and finite-domain Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). In particular, we prove fixed parameter tractability (FPT) with respect to clique-width and tree-width of the input. This also allows us to count solutions of minimal cost, which is an overlooked problem in the literature.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches to agent programming often entangle two aspects of agent design: the core workflow logic and the inference-time strategy (e.g., tree search). We introduce "probabilistic angelic nondeterminism" ("PAN"), a programming model that disentangles these two concerns, allowing the programmer to describe the agent workflow and independently experiment with different inference-time strategies by simply changing a few inputs. We provide an implementation of PAN in Python as the EnCompass framework, which uses a Python decorator to compile agent workflow programs into a search space. We present three case studies that demonstrate how the framework lets the programmer quickly improve the reliability of an agent and easily switch between different inference-time strategies, all with little additional coding.</p></details> | <details><summary>65 pa...</summary><p>65 pages, 2 figures, published in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |

By enforcing that all discovered candidate model expressions adhere to DCP composition rules, we ensure that the output expressions are globally convex by construction, circumventing the computationally intractable process of post-hoc convexity verification. This approach allows for the discovery of convex surrogates that exhibit more relaxed and accurate functional forms than traditional fixed-parameter convex expressions (e.g., quadratic functions). The proposed method produces interpretable, verifiable, and flexible convex models suitable for safety-critical control and optimization tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 2 figures.

| **[Functional Python Programming in Introductory Computer Science Courses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03492v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The functional programming paradigm has a long and storied history, with its beginnings in the Lambda Calculus. In recent decades, pure functional languages such as Haskell have been shown to be highly effective in producing robust software due to immutable data structures, among other functional features. The advantages of programming with immutable data structures can also be had in non-functional languages such as Python. Over the years, non-functional languages have introduced immutable data structures as well as comprehension and lambda expressions, and it is possible to program in a purely functional style in them. In this paper, we present a ``best practice'' idea in introductory programming classes that forces students to learn and complete programming assignments in a purely functional subset of Python. By doing so, the student can learn functional ideas such as immutability, pure functions with no side effects, and stateless programming. We define a functional subset of Python and illustrate the best practice using small examples. We strongly feel that students in computing need familiarity with pure functional programming and argue that this can be taught in introductory programming courses that use Python.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented in Best Practices Track of COMPUTE 2025 (arXiv:2512.02349)</p></details> |
| **[Exploring the Potential and Limitations of Large Language Models for Novice Program Fault Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03421v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Novice programmers often face challenges in fault localization due to their limited experience and understanding of programming syntax and logic. Traditional methods like Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) and Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) help identify faults but often lack the ability to understand code context, making them less effective for beginners. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in overcoming these limitations by utilizing their ability to understand program syntax and semantics. LLM-based fault localization provides more accurate and context-aware results than traditional techniques. This study evaluates six closed-source and seven open-source LLMs using the Codeflaws, Condefects, and BugT datasets, with BugT being a newly constructed dataset specifically designed to mitigate data leakage concerns. Advanced models with reasoning capabilities, such as OpenAI o3 and DeepSeekR1, achieve superior accuracy with minimal reliance on prompt engineering. In contrast, models without reasoning capabilities, like GPT-4, require carefully designed prompts to maintain performance. While LLMs perform well in simple fault localization, their accuracy decreases as problem difficulty increases, though top models maintain robust performance in the BugT dataset. Over-reasoning is another challenge, where some models generate excessive explanations that hinder fault localization clarity. Additionally, the computational cost of deploying LLMs remains a significant barrier for real-time debugging. LLM's explanations demonstrate significant value for novice programmer assistance, with one-year experience participants consistently rating them highly. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to improve debugging efficiency while stressing the need for further refinement in their reasoning and computational efficiency for practical adoption.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted for publication in The Journal of Systems & Software</p></details> |

| **[Probabilistic energy profiler for statically typed JVM-based programming languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02738v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy consumption is a growing concern in several fields, from mobile devices to large data centers. Developers need detailed data on the energy consumption of their software to mitigate consumption issues. Previous approaches have a broader focus, such as on specific functions or programs, rather than source code statements. They primarily focus on estimating the CPU's energy consumption using point estimates, thereby disregarding other hardware effects and limiting their use for statistical reasoning and explainability. We developed a novel methodology to address the limitations of measuring only the CPU's consumption and using point estimates, focusing on predicting the energy usage of statically typed JVM-based programming languages, such as Java and Scala. We measure the energy consumption of Bytecode patterns, the translation from the programming language's source code statement to their Java Bytecode representation. With the energy measurements, we construct a statistical model using Bayesian statistics, which allows us to predict the energy consumption through statistical distributions and analyze individual factors. The model includes three factors we obtain statically from the code: data size, data type, operation, and one factor about the hardware platform the code executes on: device. To validate our methodology, we implemented it for Java and evaluated its energy predictions on unseen programs. We observe that all four factors are influential, notably that two devices of the same model may differ in energy consumption and that the operations and data types cause consumption differences. The experiments also show that the energy prediction of programs closely follows the program's real energy consumption, validating our approach. Our work presents a methodology for constructing an energy model that future work, such as verification tools, can use for their energy estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bounded Exhaustive Random Program Generation for Testing Solidity Compilers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20332v7)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By July 2025, smart contracts collectively manage roughly $120 billion in assets. With Solidity remaining the dominant language for smart contract development, the correctness of Solidity compilers has become critically important. However, Solidity compilers are bug-prone, with a recent study revealing that combinations of qualifiers in Solidity programs are the primary cause of compiler crashes, accounting for 40.5% of all historical crashes. While random program generators are widely used for compiler testing, they may be less effective at finding Solidity compiler bugs because they explore the unbounded space of possible programs rather than concentrating on the specific subspace related to bug-prone qualifiers. A promising idea for finding qualifier-related bugs is to bound the search space based on empirical evidence of where such bugs are likely to occur, specifically focusing test generation to target subspaces with rich combinations of qualifiers. To address this, we propose bounded exhaustive random program generation, a novel approach that dynamically bounds the search space, enhancing the likelihood of uncovering Solidity compiler bugs. Specifically, our method bounds the search space by generating valid program templates that abstract programs that use bug-prone qualifiers, and then uses these templates as a basis for compiler testing through exhaustive enumeration of suitable qualifiers. Mechanisms are devised to address technical challenges regarding validity and efficiency. We have implemented our novel generation approach in a new tool, Erwin. We have used Erwin to find and report 26 bugs across two Solidity compilers, solc and solang, and one Solidity static analyzer, slither. Among these, 23 were previously unknown, 18 have been confirmed, and 10 have been fixed. Evaluation results demonstrate that Erwin outperforms state-of-the-art Solidity fuzzers in bug detection.</p></details> |  |

We first show some properties of the vertices of the associated polytope, which are then used to decompose the problem into instances of the multidimensional knapsack cover problem with a single continuous variable per dimension. The proposed decomposition is used to design a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem with a fixed number of constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approximation scheme for such a general class of covering mixed-integer programs. Moreover, we design a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme and an approximate linear programming formulation for the case with a single constraint. These results improve upon the previously best-known 2-approximation algorithm for the knapsack cover problem with a single continuous variable. Finally, we show a perfect compact formulation for the case where all variables have the same lower and upper bounds. Analogous results are derived for the packing and assignment variants of the problem.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Importantly, the language captures not just qubit operations, but qudit operations for any dimension $d$. Throughout the paper we explore what it means to program with projective Cliffords through a number of examples and a case study focusing on stabilizer error correcting codes.</p></details> | 44 pages |

The study aims to validate the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for extracting structural feature embeddings from MILP instances, using the air05 crew scheduling problem. The MILP instance was transformed into a heterogeneous bipartite graph to model relationships between variables and constraints. Two neural architectures, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) were trained to generate node embeddings. These representations were evaluated using Instance Space Analysis (ISA) through linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP, t-SNE) dimensionality reduction techniques. Analysis revealed that PCA failed to distinguish cluster structures, necessitating non-linear reductions to visualize the embedding topology. The GCN architecture demonstrated superior performance, capturing global topology with well-defined clusters for both variables and constraints. In contrast, the GAT model failed to organize the constraint space. The findings confirm that simpler graph architectures can effectively map the sparse topology of aviation logistics problems without manual feature engineering, contributing to explainability of instance complexity. This structural awareness provides a validated foundation for developing future Learning to Optimize (L2O) agents capable of improving solver performance in safety-critical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, presented at XXII SITRAER 2025, in processes for submission to JATM</p></details> |

If the original constraints are feasible, then the optimizer finds the optimal solution to the original QP. On the other hand, if the constraints are infeasible, the optimizer identifies a solution that minimizes the constraint violation in a sparse manner. FlexQP scales favorably with respect to the problem dimension, is robust to both feasible and infeasible QPs with minimal assumptions on the problem data, and can be effectively warm-started. We subsequently apply deep unfolding to improve our optimizer through data-driven techniques, leading to an accelerated Deep FlexQP. By learning dimension-agnostic feedback policies for the parameters from a small number of training examples, Deep FlexQP generalizes to problems with larger dimensions and can optimize for many more iterations than it was initially trained for. Our approach outperforms two recently proposed state-of-the-art accelerated QP approaches on a suite of benchmark systems including portfolio optimization, classification, and regression problems. We provide guarantees on the expected performance of our deep QP optimizer through probably approximately correct (PAC) Bayes generalization bounds. These certificates are used to design an accelerated sequential quadratic programming solver that solves nonlinear optimal control and predictive safety filter problems faster than traditional approaches. Overall, our approach is very robust and greatly outperforms existing non-learning and learning-based optimizers in terms of both runtime and convergence to the optimal solution across multiple classes of NLPs.</p></details> |  |

Understanding students' trust, perceived usefulness, and dependency on AI tools is essential to improving their integration into education. For these purposes, this study surveyed 508 first-year programming students in Pampanga, Philippines and analyzed their perceptions using hierarchical clustering. Results showed four unique student profiles with varying in trust and usage intensity. While students acknowledged AI tools' benefits, dependency remained low due to limited infrastructure and insufficient exposure. High-frequency users did not necessarily report greater trust or usefulness which may indicates a complex relationship between usage patterns and perception. This study recommends that to maximize AI's educational impact, targeted interventions such as infrastructure development, training programs, and curriculum integration are necessary. This study provides empirical insights to support equitable and effective AI adoption in programming education within developing regions.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 tables, 2 figures</p></details> |

However, its substantial data size poses a significant challenge for transmission and storage. While many compression techniques have been proposed, they fail to efficiently adapt to fluctuating network bandwidth, leading to resource wastage. We address this issue from the perspective of size-aware compression, where we aim to compress 3DGS to a desired size by quickly searching for suitable hyperparameters. Through a measurement study, we identify key hyperparameters that affect the size -- namely, the reserve ratio of Gaussians and bit-width settings for Gaussian attributes. Then, we formulate this hyperparameter optimization problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, with the goal of maximizing visual quality while respecting the size budget constraint. To solve the MINLP, we decouple this problem into two parts: discretely sampling the reserve ratio and determining the bit-width settings using integer linear programming (ILP). To solve the ILP more quickly and accurately, we design a quality loss estimator and a calibrated size estimator, as well as implement a CUDA kernel. Extensive experiments on multiple 3DGS variants demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in post-training compression. Furthermore, our method can achieve comparable quality to leading training-required methods after fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autom...</summary><p>Automatically compressing 3DGS into the desired file size while maximizing the visual quality</p></details> |
| **[UNIQ: Communication-Efficient Distributed Quantum Computing via Unified Nonlinear Integer Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00401v1)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Distributed quantum computing (DQC) is widely regarded as a promising approach to overcome quantum hardware limitations. A major challenge in DQC lies in reducing the communication cost introduced by remote CNOT gates, which are significantly slower and more resource-consuming than local operations. Existing DQC approaches treat the three essential components (qubit allocation, entanglement management, and network scheduling) as independent stages, optimizing each in isolation. However, we observe that these components are inherently interdependent, and therefore adopting a unified optimization strategy can be more efficient to achieve the global optimal solutions. Consequently, we propose UNIQ, a novel DQC optimization framework that integrates all three components into a non-linear integer programming (NIP) model. UNIQ aims to reduce the circuit runtime by maximizing parallel Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair generation through the use of idle communication qubits, while simultaneously minimizing the communication cost of remote gates. To solve this NP-hard formulated problem, we adopt two key strategies: a greedy algorithm for efficiently mapping logical qubits to different QPUs, and a JIT (Just-In-Time) approach that builds EPR pairs in parallel within each time slot. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach is widely applicable to diverse quantum circuits and QPU topologies, while substantially reducing communication cost and runtime over existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Program Repair of Uncompilable Student Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06187v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A significant portion of student programming submissions in CS1 learning environments are uncompilable, limiting their use in student modeling and downstream knowledge tracing. Traditional modeling pipelines often exclude these cases, discarding observations of student learning. This study investigates automated program repair as a strategy to recover uncompilable code while preserving students' structural intent for use in student modeling. Within this framework, we assess large language models (LLMs) as repair agents under high- and low-context prompting conditions. Repairs were evaluated for compilability, edit distance, and preservation of students' original structure and logic. While all models produced compilable repairs, they differed in how well they preserve students' control flow and code structure, affecting their pedagogical utility. By recovering uncompilable submissions, this work enables richer and more comprehensive analyses of learners' coding processes and development over time.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 57th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education V.2 (SIGCSE TS 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Functional Program Synthesis with Higher-Order Functions and Recursion Schemes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23354v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program synthesis is the process of generating a computer program following a set of specifications, such as a set of input-output examples. It can be modeled as a search problem in which the search space is the set of all valid programs. As the search space is vast, brute force is usually not feasible, and search heuristics, such as genetic programming, also have difficulty navigating it without guidance. This text presents 2 novel GP algorithms that synthesize pure, typed, and functional programs: HOTGP and Origami. HOTGP uses strong types and a functional grammar, synthesizing Haskell code, with support for higher-order functions, $λ$-functions, and parametric polymorphism. Experimental results show that HOTGP is competitive with the state of the art. Additionally, Origami is an algorithm that tackles the challenge of effectively handling loops and recursion by exploring Recursion Schemes, in which the programs are composed of well-defined templates with only a few parts that need to be synthesized. The first implementation of Origami can synthesize solutions in several Recursion Schemes and data structures, being competitive with other GP methods in the literature, as well as LLMs. The latest version of Origami employs a novel procedure, called AC/DC, designed to improve the search-space exploration. It achieves considerable improvement over its previous version by raising success rates on every problem. Compared to similar methods in the literature, it has the highest count of problems solved with success rates of $100\%$, $\geq 75\%$, and $\geq 25\%$ across all benchmarks. In $18\%$ of all benchmark problems, it stands as the only method to reach $100\%$ success rate, being the first known approach to achieve it on any problem in PSB2. It also demonstrates competitive performance to LLMs, achieving the highest overall win-rate against Copilot among all GP methods.</p></details> | Doctoral thesis |
| **[All for One and One for All: Program Logics for Exploiting Internal Determinism in Parallel Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23283v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nondeterminism makes parallel programs challenging to write and reason about. To avoid these challenges, researchers have developed techniques for internally deterministic parallel programming, in which the steps of a parallel computation proceed in a deterministic way. Internal determinism is useful because it lets a programmer reason about a program as if it executed in a sequential order. However, no verification framework exists to exploit this property and simplify formal reasoning about internally deterministic programs. To capture the essence of why internally deterministic programs should be easier to reason about, this paper defines a property called schedule-independent safety. A program satisfies schedule-independent safety, if, to show that the program is safe across all orderings, it suffices to show that one terminating execution of the program is safe. We then present a separation logic called Musketeer for proving that a program satisfies schedule-independent safety. Once a parallel program has been shown to satisfy schedule-independent safety, we can verify it with a new logic called Angelic, which allows one to dynamically select and verify just one sequential ordering of the program. Using Musketeer, we prove the soundness of MiniDet, an affine type system for enforcing internal determinism. MiniDet supports several core algorithmic primitives for internally deterministic programming that have been identified in the research literature, including a deterministic version of a concurrent hash set. Because any syntactically well-typed MiniDet program satisfies schedule-independent safety, we can apply Angelic to verify such programs. All results in this paper have been verified in Rocq using the Iris separation logic framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 26 figures, extended version of the same paper accepted at POPL 2026</p></details> |
