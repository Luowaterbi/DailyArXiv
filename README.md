| **[LoRACode: LoRA Adapters for Code Embeddings](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05315v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code embeddings are essential for semantic code search; however, current approaches often struggle to capture the precise syntactic and contextual nuances inherent in code. Open-source models such as CodeBERT and UniXcoder exhibit limitations in scalability and efficiency, while high-performing proprietary systems impose substantial computational costs. We introduce a parameter-efficient fine-tuning method based on Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) to construct task-specific adapters for code retrieval. Our approach reduces the number of trainable parameters to less than two percent of the base model, enabling rapid fine-tuning on extensive code corpora (2 million samples in 25 minutes on two H100 GPUs). Experiments demonstrate an increase of up to 9.1% in Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR) for Code2Code search, and up to 86.69% for Text2Code search tasks across multiple programming languages. Distinction in task-wise and language-wise adaptation helps explore the sensitivity of code retrieval for syntactical and linguistic variations. To foster research in this area, we make our code and pre-trained models publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at the Deep Learning for Code (DL4C) Workshop at ICLR 2025</p></details> |
| **[An Insight into Security Code Review with LLMs: Capabilities, Obstacles, and Influential Factors](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.16310v4)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Security code review is a time-consuming and labor-intensive process typically requiring integration with automated security defect detection tools. However, existing security analysis tools struggle with poor generalization, high false positive rates, and coarse detection granularity. Large Language Models (LLMs) have been considered promising candidates for addressing those challenges. In this study, we conducted an empirical study to explore the potential of LLMs in detecting security defects during code review. Specifically, we evaluated the performance of six LLMs under five different prompts and compared them with state-of-the-art static analysis tools. We also performed linguistic and regression analyses for the best-performing LLM to identify quality problems in its responses and factors influencing its performance. Our findings showthat: (1) existing pre-trained LLMs have limited capability in security code review but significantly outperformthe state-of-the-art static analysis tools. (2) GPT-4 performs best among all LLMs when provided with a CWE list for reference. (3) GPT-4 frequently generates verbose or non-compliant responses with the task requirements given in the prompts. (4) GPT-4 is more adept at identifying security defects in code files with fewer tokens, containing functional logic, or written by developers with less involvement in the project.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 5 images, 8 tables, Manuscript submitted to a journal (2025)</p></details> |
| **[Tadashi: Enabling AI-Based Automated Code Generation With Guaranteed Correctness](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.03210v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frameworks and domain-specific languages for auto-generating code have traditionally depended on human experts to implement rigorous methods ensuring the legality of code transformations. Recently, machine learning (ML) has gained traction for generating code optimized for specific hardware targets. However, ML approaches-particularly black-box neural networks-offer no guarantees on the correctness or legality of the transformations they produce. To address this gap, we introduce Tadashi, an end-to-end system that leverages the polyhedral model to support researchers in curating datasets critical for ML-based code generation. Tadashi provides an end-to-end system capable of applying, verifying, and evaluating candidate transformations on polyhedral schedules with both reliability and practicality. We formally prove that Tadashi guarantees the legality of generated transformations, demonstrate its low runtime overhead, and showcase its broad applicability.

| **[Information-Set Decoding for Convolutional Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.07621v4)** | 2025-06-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a framework for generic decoding of convolutional codes, which allows us to do cryptanalysis of code-based systems that use convolutional codes. We then apply this framework to information set decoding, study success probabilities and give tools to choose variables. Finally, we use this to attack two cryptosystems based on convolutional codes. In the first, our code recovered about 74% of errors in less than 10 hours each, and in the second case, we give experimental evidence that 80% of the errors can be recovered in times corresponding to about 70 bits of operational security, with some instances being significantly lower.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving the Context Length and Efficiency of Code Retrieval for Tracing Security Vulnerability Fixes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22935v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An upstream task for software bill-of-materials (SBOMs) is the accurate localization of the patch that fixes a vulnerability. Nevertheless, existing work reveals a significant gap in the CVEs whose patches exist but are not traceable. Existing works have proposed several approaches to trace/retrieve the patching commit for fixing a CVE. However, they suffer from two major challenges: (1) They cannot effectively handle long diff code of a commit; (2) We are not aware of existing work that scales to the full repository with satisfactory accuracy. Upon identifying this gap, we propose SITPatchTracer, a scalable and effective retrieval system for tracing known vulnerability patches. To handle the context length challenge, SITPatchTracer proposes a novel hierarchical embedding technique which efficiently extends the context coverage to 6x that of existing work while covering all files in the commit. To handle the scalability challenge, SITPatchTracer utilizes a three-phase framework, balancing the effectiveness/efficiency in each phase. The evaluation of SITPatchTracer demonstrates it outperforms existing patch tracing methods (PatchFinder, PatchScout, VFCFinder) by a large margin. Furthermore, SITPatchTracer outperforms VoyageAI, the SOTA commercial code embedding LLM (\$1.8 per 10K commits) on the MRR and Recall@10 by 18\% and 28\% on our two datasets. Using SITPatchTracer, we have successfully traced and merged the patch links for 35 new CVEs in the GitHub Advisory database Our ablation study reveals that hierarchical embedding is a practically effective way of handling long context for patch retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[NoCodeGPT: A No-Code Interface for Building Web Apps with Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.14843v3)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we first report an exploratory study where three participants were instructed to use ChatGPT to implement a simple Web-based application. A key finding of this study revealed that ChatGPT does not offer a user-friendly interface for building applications, even small web systems. For example, one participant with limited experience in software development was unable to complete any of the proposed user stories. Then, and as the primary contribution of this work, we decided to design, implement, and evaluate a tool that offers a customized interface for language models like GPT, specifically targeting the implementation of small web applications without writing code. This tool, called NoCodeGPT, instruments the prompts sent to the language model with useful contextual information (e.g., the files that need to be modified when the user identifies and requests a bug fix). It also saves the files generated by the language model in the correct directories. Additionally, a simple version control feature is offered, allowing users to quickly revert to a previous version of the code when the model enters a hallucination process, generating worthless results. To evaluate our tool, we invited 14 students with limited Web development experience to implement two small web applications using only prompts and NoCodeGPT. Overall, the results of this evaluation were quite satisfactory and significantly better than those of the initial study (the one using the standard ChatGPT interface). More than half of the participants (9 out of 14) successfully completed the proposed applications, while the others completed at least half of the proposed user stories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at Software: Practice and Experience.

| **[Utilizing Precise and Complete Code Context to Guide LLM in Automatic False Positive Mitigation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.03079v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static Application Security Testing (SAST) tools are critical to software quality, identifying potential code issues early in development. However, they often produce false positive warnings that require manual review, slowing down development. Thus, automating false positive mitigation (FPM) is essential. The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs), with their strong abilities in natural language and code understanding, offers promising avenues for FPM. Yet current LLM-based FPM method faces two major limitations: 1. The warning-related code snippets extracted are overly broad and cluttered with irrelevant control/data flows, reducing precision; 2. Critical code contexts are missing, leading to incomplete representations that can mislead LLMs and cause inaccurate assessments. To overcome these limitations, we propose LLM4FPM , a lightweight and efficient false positive mitigation framework. It features eCPG-Slicer, which builds an extended code property graph (eCPG) to extract precise line-level code contexts for warnings. Furthermore, the integrated FARF algorithm builds a file reference graph to identify all files that are relevant to warnings in linear time. This enables eCPG-Slicer to obtain rich contextual information without resorting to expensive whole-program analysis. LLM4FPM outperforms the existing method on the Juliet dataset (F1 > 99% across various Common Weakness Enumerations) and improves label accuracy on the D2A dataset to 86%. By leveraging a lightweight open-source LLM, LLM4FPM can significantly save inspection costs up to \$2758 per run (\$0.384 per warning) on Juliet with an average inspection time of 4.7s per warning. Moreover, real-world tests on popular C/C++ projects demonstrate its practicality.</p></details> | 13 pages |
| **[StarVector: Generating Scalable Vector Graphics Code from Images and Text](http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.11556v4)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scalable Vector Graphics (SVGs) are vital for modern image rendering due to their scalability and versatility. Previous SVG generation methods have focused on curve-based vectorization, lacking semantic understanding, often producing artifacts, and struggling with SVG primitives beyond path curves. To address these issues, we introduce StarVector, a multimodal large language model for SVG generation. It performs image vectorization by understanding image semantics and using SVG primitives for compact, precise outputs. Unlike traditional methods, StarVector works directly in the SVG code space, leveraging visual understanding to apply accurate SVG primitives. To train StarVector, we create SVG-Stack, a diverse dataset of 2M samples that enables generalization across vectorization tasks and precise use of primitives like ellipses, polygons, and text. We address challenges in SVG evaluation, showing that pixel-based metrics like MSE fail to capture the unique qualities of vector graphics. We introduce SVG-Bench, a benchmark across 10 datasets, and 3 tasks: Image-to-SVG, Text-to-SVG generation, and diagram generation. Using this setup, StarVector achieves state-of-the-art performance, producing more compact and semantically rich SVGs.</p></details> |  |
| **[ProjectEval: A Benchmark for Programming Agents Automated Evaluation on Project-Level Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.07010v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recently, LLM agents have made rapid progress in improving their programming capabilities. However, existing benchmarks lack the ability to automatically evaluate from users' perspective, and also lack the explainability of the results of LLM agents' code generation capabilities. Thus, we introduce ProjectEval, a new benchmark for LLM agents project-level code generation's automated evaluation by simulating user interaction. ProjectEval is constructed by LLM with human reviewing. It has three different level inputs of natural languages or code skeletons. ProjectEval can evaluate the generated projects by user interaction simulation for execution, and by code similarity through existing objective indicators. Through ProjectEval, we find that systematic engineering project code, overall understanding of the project and comprehensive analysis capability are the keys for LLM agents to achieve practical projects. Our findings and benchmark provide valuable insights for developing more effective programming agents that can be deployed in future real-world production.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages (9 Appendix pages), 4 figures, 7 tables</p></details> |
| **[CodeReviewQA: The Code Review Comprehension Assessment for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.16167v2)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>State-of-the-art large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive code generation capabilities but struggle with real-world software engineering tasks, such as revising source code to address code reviews, hindering their practical use. Code review comments are often implicit, ambiguous, and colloquial, requiring models to grasp both code and human intent. This challenge calls for evaluating large language models' ability to bridge both technical and conversational contexts. While existing work has employed the automated code refinement (ACR) task to resolve these comments, current evaluation methods fall short, relying on text matching metrics that provide limited insight into model failures and remain susceptible to training data contamination. To address these limitations, we introduce a novel evaluation benchmark, $\textbf{CodeReviewQA}$ that enables us to conduct fine-grained assessment of model capabilities and mitigate data contamination risks. In CodeReviewQA, we decompose the generation task of code refinement into $\textbf{three essential reasoning steps}$: $\textit{change type recognition}$ (CTR), $\textit{change localisation}$ (CL), and $\textit{solution identification}$ (SI). Each step is reformulated as multiple-choice questions with varied difficulty levels, enabling precise assessment of model capabilities, while mitigating data contamination risks. Our comprehensive evaluation spans 72 recently released large language models on $\textbf{900 manually curated, high-quality examples}$ across nine programming languages. Our results show that CodeReviewQA is able to expose specific model weaknesses in code review comprehension, disentangled from their generative automated code refinement results.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is published in Findings of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025)</p></details> |
| **[KnowCoder-X: Boosting Multilingual Information Extraction via Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04794v3)** | 2025-05-31 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Empirical evidence indicates that LLMs exhibit spontaneous cross-lingual alignment. However, although LLMs show promising cross-lingual alignment in Information Extraction (IE), a significant imbalance across languages persists, highlighting an underlying deficiency. To address this, we propose KnowCoder-X, a powerful code LLM with advanced cross-lingual and multilingual capabilities for universal IE. Firstly, it standardizes the representation of multilingual schemas using Python classes, ensuring a consistent ontology across different languages. Then, IE across languages is formulated as a unified code generation task. Secondly, we conduct IE cross-lingual alignment instruction tuning on the translated instance prediction task to enhance the model's cross-lingual transferability. During this phase, we also construct a high-quality and diverse bilingual IE parallel dataset with 257k samples, called ParallelNER, synthesized by our proposed robust three-stage pipeline, with manual annotation to ensure quality. Although without training in 29 unseen languages, KnowCoder-X surpasses ChatGPT by 30.17\% and SoTA by 20.03\%, thereby demonstrating superior cross-lingual IE capabilities. Comprehensive evaluations on 64 IE benchmarks in Chinese and English under various settings demonstrate that KnowCoder-X significantly enhances cross-lingual IE transfer through boosting the IE alignment. Our code and dataset are available at: https://github.com/ICT-GoKnow/KnowCoder</p></details> | ACL 2025 Findings |
| **[Calibration of Large Language Models on Code Summarization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.19318v3)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A brief, fluent, and relevant summary can be helpful during program comprehension; however, such a summary does require significant human effort to produce. Often, good summaries are unavailable in software projects, which makes maintenance more difficult. There has been a considerable body of research into automated AI-based methods, using Large Language models (LLMs), to generate summaries of code; there also has been quite a bit of work on ways to measure the performance of such summarization methods, with special attention paid to how closely these AI-generated summaries resemble a summary a human might have produced. Measures such as BERTScore and BLEU have been suggested and evaluated with human-subject studies. However, LLM-generated summaries can be inaccurate, incomplete, etc.: generally, too dissimilar to one that a good developer might write. Given an LLM-generated code summary, how can a user rationally judge if a summary is sufficiently good and reliable? Given just some input source code, and an LLM-generated summary, existing approaches can help judge brevity, fluency and relevance of the summary; however, it's difficult to gauge whether an LLM-generated summary sufficiently resembles what a human might produce, without a "golden" human-produced summary to compare against. We study this resemblance question as calibration problem: given just the code & the summary from an LLM, can we compute a confidence measure, that provides a reliable indication of whether the summary sufficiently resembles what a human would have produced in this situation? We examine this question using several LLMs, for several languages, and in several different settings. Our investigation suggests approaches to provide reliable predictions of the likelihood that an LLM-generated summary would sufficiently resemble a summary a human might write for the same code.</p></details> |  |
| **[HiLDe: Intentional Code Generation via Human-in-the-Loop Decoding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22906v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While AI programming tools hold the promise of increasing programmers' capabilities and productivity to a remarkable degree, they often exclude users from essential decision-making processes, causing many to effectively "turn off their brains" and over-rely on solutions provided by these systems. These behaviors can have severe consequences in critical domains, like software security. We propose Human-in-the-loop Decoding, a novel interaction technique that allows users to observe and directly influence LLM decisions during code generation, in order to align the model's output with their personal requirements. We implement this technique in HiLDe, a code completion assistant that highlights critical decisions made by the LLM and provides local alternatives for the user to explore. In a within-subjects study (N=18) on security-related tasks, we found that HiLDe led participants to generate significantly fewer vulnerabilities and better align code generation with their goals compared to a traditional code completion assistant.</p></details> | 10 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Afterburner: Reinforcement Learning Facilitates Self-Improving Code Efficiency Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23387v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) generate functionally correct solutions but often fall short in code efficiency, a critical bottleneck for real-world deployment. In this paper, we introduce a novel test-time iterative optimization framework to address this, employing a closed-loop system where LLMs iteratively refine code based on empirical performance feedback from an execution sandbox. We explore three training strategies: Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT), Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO). Experiments on our Venus dataset and the APPS benchmark show that SFT and DPO rapidly saturate in efficiency gains. In contrast, GRPO, using reinforcement learning (RL) with execution feedback, continuously optimizes code performance, significantly boosting both pass@1 (from 47% to 62%) and the likelihood of outperforming human submissions in efficiency (from 31% to 45%). Our work demonstrates effective test-time code efficiency improvement and critically reveals the power of RL in teaching LLMs to truly self-improve code efficiency.</p></details> |  |
| **[ToolCoder: A Systematic Code-Empowered Tool Learning Framework for Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.11404v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tool learning has emerged as a crucial capability for large language models (LLMs) to solve complex real-world tasks through interaction with external tools. Existing approaches face significant challenges, including reliance on hand-crafted prompts, difficulty in multi-step planning, and lack of precise error diagnosis and reflection mechanisms. We propose ToolCoder, a novel framework that reformulates tool learning as a code generation task. Inspired by software engineering principles, ToolCoder transforms natural language queries into structured Python function scaffold and systematically breaks down tasks with descriptive comments, enabling LLMs to leverage coding paradigms for complex reasoning and planning. It then generates and executes function implementations to obtain final responses. Additionally, ToolCoder stores successfully executed functions in a repository to promote code reuse, while leveraging error traceback mechanisms for systematic debugging, optimizing both execution efficiency and robustness. Experiments demonstrate that ToolCoder achieves superior performance in task completion accuracy and execution reliability compared to existing approaches, establishing the effectiveness of code-centric approaches in tool learning.</p></details> | Accepted to ACL 2025 |
| **[CoRet: Improved Retriever for Code Editing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24715v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce CoRet, a dense retrieval model designed for code-editing tasks that integrates code semantics, repository structure, and call graph dependencies. The model focuses on retrieving relevant portions of a code repository based on natural language queries such as requests to implement new features or fix bugs. These retrieved code chunks can then be presented to a user or to a second code-editing model or agent. To train CoRet, we propose a loss function explicitly designed for repository-level retrieval. On SWE-bench and Long Code Arena's bug localisation datasets, we show that our model substantially improves retrieval recall by at least 15 percentage points over existing models, and ablate the design choices to show their importance in achieving these results.</p></details> | ACL 2025 |
| **[Maximally recoverable codes with locality and availability](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24573v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce maximally recoverable codes with locality and availability. We consider locally repairable codes (LRCs) where certain subsets of $ t $ symbols belong each to $ N $ local repair sets, which are pairwise disjoint after removing the $ t $ symbols, and which are of size $ r+\delta-1 $ and can correct $ \delta-1 $ erasures locally. Classical LRCs with $ N $ disjoint repair sets and LRCs with $ N $-availability are recovered when setting $ t = 1 $ and $ t=\delta-1=1 $, respectively. Allowing $ t > 1 $ enables our codes to reduce the storage overhead for the same locality and availability. In this setting, we define maximally recoverable LRCs (MR-LRCs) as those that can correct any globally correctable erasure pattern given the locality and availability constraints. We provide three explicit constructions, based on MSRD codes, each attaining the smallest finite-field sizes for some parameter regime. Finally, we extend the known lower bound on finite-field sizes from classical MR-LRCs to our setting.</p></details> |  |
| **[VecTrans: Enhancing Compiler Auto-Vectorization through LLM-Assisted Code Transformations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.19449v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Auto-vectorization is a fundamental optimization for modern compilers to exploit SIMD parallelism. However, state-of-the-art approaches still struggle to handle intricate code patterns, often requiring manual hints or domain-specific expertise. Large language models (LLMs), with their ability to capture intricate patterns, provide a promising solution, yet their effective application in compiler optimizations remains an open challenge due to issues such as hallucinations and a lack of domain-specific reasoning. In this paper, we present VecTrans, a novel framework that leverages LLMs to enhance compiler-based code vectorization. VecTrans first employs compiler analysis to identify potentially vectorizable code regions. It then utilizes an LLM to refactor these regions into patterns that are more amenable to the compilers auto-vectorization. To ensure semantic correctness, VecTrans further integrates a hybrid validation mechanism at the intermediate representation (IR) level. With the above efforts, VecTrans combines the adaptability of LLMs with the precision of compiler vectorization, thereby effectively opening up the vectorization opportunities. experimental results show that among all TSVC functions unvectorizable by GCC, ICC, Clang, and BiSheng Compiler, VecTrans achieves an geomean speedup of 1.77x and successfully vectorizes 24 of 51 test cases. This marks a significant advancement over state-of-the-art approaches while maintaining a cost efficiency of $0.012 per function optimization for LLM API usage.</p></details> |  |
| **[Deep Holes of Twisted Reed-Solomon Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.11436v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deep holes of a linear code are the vectors that achieve the maximum error distance (covering radius) to the code. {Determining the covering radius and deep holes of linear codes is a fundamental problem in coding theory. In this paper, we investigate the problem of deep holes of twisted Reed-Solomon codes.} The covering radius and a standard class of deep holes of twisted Reed-Solomon codes ${\rm TRS}_k(\mathcal{A}, \theta)$ are obtained for a general evaluation set $\mathcal{A} \subseteq \mathbb{F}_q$. Furthermore, we consider the problem of determining all deep holes of the full-length twisted Reed-Solomon codes ${\rm TRS}_k(\mathbb{F}_q, \theta)$. For even $q$, by utilizing the polynomial method and Gauss sums over finite fields, we prove that the standard deep holes are all the deep holes of ${\rm TRS}_k(\mathbb{F}_q, \theta)$ with $\frac{3q-4}{4} \leq k\leq q-4$. For odd $q$, we adopt a different method and employ the results on some equations over finite fields to show that there are also no other deep holes of ${\rm TRS}_k(\mathbb{F}_q, \theta)$ with $\frac{3q+3\sqrt{q}-7}{4} \leq k\leq q-4$. In addition, for the boundary cases of $k=q-3, q-2$ and $q-1$, we completely determine their deep holes using results on certain character sums.</p></details> |  |
| **[Towards Effective Code-Integrated Reasoning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24480v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we investigate code-integrated reasoning, where models generate code when necessary and integrate feedback by executing it through a code interpreter. To acquire this capability, models must learn when and how to use external code tools effectively, which is supported by tool-augmented reinforcement learning (RL) through interactive learning. Despite its benefits, tool-augmented RL can still suffer from potential instability in the learning dynamics. In light of this challenge, we present a systematic approach to improving the training effectiveness and stability of tool-augmented RL for code-integrated reasoning. Specifically, we develop enhanced training strategies that balance exploration and stability, progressively building tool-use capabilities while improving reasoning performance. Through extensive experiments on five mainstream mathematical reasoning benchmarks, our model demonstrates significant performance improvements over multiple competitive baselines. Furthermore, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the mechanism and effect of code-integrated reasoning, revealing several key insights, such as the extension of model's capability boundaries and the simultaneous improvement of reasoning efficiency through code integration.

We address this challenge by curating VietMix, a parallel corpus of naturally occurring code-mixed Vietnamese text paired with expert English translations. Augmenting this resource, we developed a complementary synthetic data generation pipeline. This pipeline incorporates filtering mechanisms to ensure syntactic plausibility and pragmatic appropriateness in code-mixing patterns. Experimental validation shows our naturalistic and complementary synthetic data boost models' performance, measured by translation quality estimation scores, of up to 71.84 on COMETkiwi and 81.77 on XCOMET. Triangulating positive results with LLM-based assessments, augmented models are favored over seed fine-tuned counterparts in approximately 49% of judgments (54-56% excluding ties). VietMix and our augmentation methodology advance ecological validity in neural MT evaluations and establish a framework for addressing code-mixed translation challenges across other low-resource pairs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Nested Hash Layer: A Plug-and-play Module for Multiple-length Hash Code Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.08922v2)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep supervised hashing is essential for efficient storage and search in large-scale image retrieval. Traditional deep supervised hashing models generate single-length hash codes, but this creates a trade-off between efficiency and effectiveness for different code lengths. To find the optimal length for a task, multiple models must be trained, increasing time and computation. Furthermore, relationships between hash codes of different lengths are often ignored. To address these issues, we propose the Nested Hash Layer (NHL), a plug-and-play module for deep supervised hashing models. NHL generates hash codes of multiple lengths simultaneously in a nested structure. To resolve optimization conflicts from multiple learning objectives, we introduce a dominance-aware dynamic weighting strategy to adjust gradients. Additionally, we propose a long-short cascade self-distillation method, where long hash codes guide the learning of shorter ones, improving overall code quality. Experiments indicate that the NHL achieves an overall training speed improvement of approximately 5 to 8 times across various deep supervised hashing models and enhances the average performance of these models by about 3.4%.</p></details> |  |
| **[SwiftEval: Developing a Language-Specific Benchmark for LLM-generated Code Evaluation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24324v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have showcased significant advancements in code generation. However, most evaluation benchmarks are primarily oriented towards Python, making it difficult to evaluate other programming languages, such as Swift, with high quality. By examining widely established multilingual benchmarks like HumanEval-XL and MultiPL-E, we identified critical issues specific to their Swift components, making them insufficient or even irrelevant for assessing LLM coding capabilities on Swift. Unlike these existing approaches, which prioritize rapid scaling and generalization by automatically translating Python-centric benchmarks with LLMs, we adopt a quality-over-quantity methodology. We present SwiftEval, the first Swift-oriented benchmark consisting of 28 carefully hand-crafted problems, and evaluate 44 popular Code LLMs on it. Our results show significant LLM scores drop for problems requiring language-specific features, most noticeable in the models of smaller sizes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to FORGE'25 Benchmarking on 15.01.2025, to be published by IEEE under the CC BY-NC-ND 4.0 license.

We also give a method for computing the vanishing ideal of the set of $\mathbb{F}_q$-rational points of $X$. When $\beta=[w_1 \cdots w_r]$ is a row matrix corresponding to a numerical semigroup $\mathbb{N}\beta=\langle w_1,\dots,w_r \rangle$, $X$ is a weighted projective space and generators of the relevant vanishing ideal is given using generators of defining (toric) ideals of numerical semigroup rings corresponding to semigroups generated by subsets of $\{w_1,\dots,w_r\}$.</p></details> | 17 pages, shortened |
| **[MGS3: A Multi-Granularity Self-Supervised Code Search Framework](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24274v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In the pursuit of enhancing software reusability and developer productivity, code search has emerged as a key area, aimed at retrieving code snippets relevant to functionalities based on natural language queries. Despite significant progress in self-supervised code pre-training utilizing the vast amount of code data in repositories, existing methods have primarily focused on leveraging contrastive learning to align natural language with function-level code snippets. These studies have overlooked the abundance of fine-grained (such as block-level and statement-level) code snippets prevalent within the function-level code snippets, which results in suboptimal performance across all levels of granularity. To address this problem, we first construct a multi-granularity code search dataset called MGCodeSearchNet, which contains 536K+ pairs of natural language and code snippets. Subsequently, we introduce a novel Multi-Granularity Self-Supervised contrastive learning code Search framework (MGS$^{3}$}). First, MGS$^{3}$ features a Hierarchical Multi-Granularity Representation module (HMGR), which leverages syntactic structural relationships for hierarchical representation and aggregates fine-grained information into coarser-grained representations. Then, during the contrastive learning phase, we endeavor to construct positive samples of the same granularity for fine-grained code, and introduce in-function negative samples for fine-grained code. Finally, we conduct extensive experiments on code search benchmarks across various granularities, demonstrating that the framework exhibits outstanding performance in code search tasks of multiple granularities. These experiments also showcase its model-agnostic nature and compatibility with existing pre-trained code representation models.</p></details> |  |

The intricate nature of the process makes it labor-intensive, time-consuming and expert-knowledge-dependent to build a large number of executable code repositories, limiting the scalability of existing work based on running tests. The primary bottleneck lies in the automated building of test environments for different repositories, which is an essential yet underexplored task. To mitigate the gap, we introduce Repo2Run, the first LLM-based agent aiming at automating the building of executable test environments for any repositories at scale. Specifically, given a code repository, Repo2Run iteratively builds the Docker image, runs unit tests based on the feedback of the building, and synthesizes the Dockerfile until the entire pipeline is executed successfully. The resulting Dockerfile can then be used to create Docker container environments for running code and tests. We created a benchmark containing 420 Python repositories with unit tests for evaluation. The results illustrate that Repo2Run achieves an 86.0% success rate, outperforming SWE-agent by 77.0%. The resources of Repo2Run are available at https://github.com/bytedance/Repo2Run.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Reward-driven Automated Webshell Malicious-code Generator for Red-teaming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24252v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Frequent cyber-attacks have elevated WebShell exploitation and defense to a critical research focus within network security. However, there remains a significant shortage of publicly available, well-categorized malicious-code datasets organized by obfuscation method. Existing malicious-code generation methods, which primarily rely on prompt engineering, often suffer from limited diversity and high redundancy in the payloads they produce. To address these limitations, we propose \textbf{RAWG}, a \textbf{R}eward-driven \textbf{A}utomated \textbf{W}ebshell Malicious-code \textbf{G}enerator designed for red-teaming applications. Our approach begins by categorizing webshell samples from common datasets into seven distinct types of obfuscation. We then employ a large language model (LLM) to extract and normalize key tokens from each sample, creating a standardized, high-quality corpus. Using this curated dataset, we perform supervised fine-tuning (SFT) on an open-source large model to enable the generation of diverse, highly obfuscated webshell malicious payloads. To further enhance generation quality, we apply Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO), treating malicious-code samples as "chosen" data and benign code as "rejected" data during reinforcement learning. Extensive experiments demonstrate that RAWG significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods in both payload diversity and escape effectiveness.</p></details> |  |

The Case of Generating Low-Code Workflows](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.24189v1)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4o can handle a wide range of complex tasks with the right prompt. As per token costs are reduced, the advantages of fine-tuning Small Language Models (SLMs) for real-world applications -- faster inference, lower costs -- may no longer be clear. In this work, we present evidence that, for domain-specific tasks that require structured outputs, SLMs still have a quality advantage. We compare fine-tuning an SLM against prompting LLMs on the task of generating low-code workflows in JSON form. We observe that while a good prompt can yield reasonable results, fine-tuning improves quality by 10% on average. We also perform systematic error analysis to reveal model limitations.</p></details> |  |

However, a universal method for designing tailored IDS-correcting codes across varying channel settings remains underexplored. We present an autoencoder-based approach, THEA-code, aimed at efficiently generating IDS-correcting codes for complex IDS channels. In the work, a disturbance-based discretization is proposed to discretize the features of the autoencoder, and a simulated differentiable IDS channel is developed as a differentiable alternative for IDS operations. These innovations facilitate the successful convergence of the autoencoder, producing channel-customized IDS-correcting codes that demonstrate commendable performance across complex IDS channels, particularly in the realistic DNA storage channel.</p></details> |  |

This paper evaluates the capabilities of the Llama 2-70B model in automating these tasks for scientific applications written in commonly used programming languages. Using representative test problems, we assess the model's capacity to generate code, documentation, and unit tests, as well as its ability to translate existing code between commonly used programming languages. Our comprehensive analysis evaluates the compilation, runtime behavior, and correctness of the generated and translated code. Additionally, we assess the quality of automatically generated code, documentation and unit tests. Our results indicate that while Llama 2-70B frequently generates syntactically correct and functional code for simpler numerical tasks, it encounters substantial difficulties with more complex, parallelized, or distributed computations, requiring considerable manual corrections. We identify key limitations and suggest areas for future improvements to better leverage AI-driven automation in scientific computing workflows.</p></details> |  |

However, reliable verifiers are hard to get for difficult coding problems, because a well-disguised wrong solution may only be detected by carefully human-written edge cases that are difficult to synthesize. To address this issue, we propose HARDTESTGEN, a pipeline for high-quality test synthesis using LLMs. With this pipeline, we curate a comprehensive competitive programming dataset HARDTESTS with 47k problems and synthetic high-quality tests. Compared with existing tests, HARDTESTGEN tests demonstrate precision that is 11.3 percentage points higher and recall that is 17.5 percentage points higher when evaluating LLM-generated code. For harder problems, the improvement in precision can be as large as 40 points. HARDTESTS also proves to be more effective for model training, measured by downstream code generation performance. We will open-source our dataset and synthesis pipeline at https://leililab.github.io/HardTests/.</p></details> |  |

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated promising capabilities for this task without requiring compilation, while also supporting user-friendly customization. However, auditing a code repository with LLMs poses significant challenges: limited context windows and hallucinations can degrade the quality of bug reports, and analyzing large-scale repositories incurs substantial time and token costs, hindering efficiency and scalability. This work introduces an LLM-based agent, RepoAudit, designed to perform autonomous repository-level code auditing. Equipped with agent memory, RepoAudit explores the codebase on demand by analyzing data-flow facts along feasible program paths within individual functions. It further incorporates a validator module to mitigate hallucinations by verifying data-flow facts and checking the satisfiability of path conditions associated with potential bugs, thereby reducing false positives. RepoAudit detects 40 true bugs across 15 real-world benchmark projects with a precision of 78.43%, requiring on average only 0.44 hours and $2.54 per project. Also, it detects 185 new bugs in high-profile projects, among which 174 have been confirmed or fixed. We have open-sourced RepoAudit at https://github.com/PurCL/RepoAudit.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 11 tables, 6 figures, 3 listings</p></details> |
| **[AceReason-Nemotron: Advancing Math and Code Reasoning through Reinforcement Learning](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16400v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite recent progress in large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for reasoning, the training recipe for building high-performing reasoning models remains elusive. Key implementation details of frontier models, such as DeepSeek-R1, including data curation strategies and RL training recipe, are often omitted. Moreover, recent research indicates distillation remains more effective than RL for smaller models. In this work, we demonstrate that large-scale RL can significantly enhance the reasoning capabilities of strong, small- and mid-sized models, achieving results that surpass those of state-of-the-art distillation-based models. We systematically study the RL training process through extensive ablations and propose a simple yet effective approach: first training on math-only prompts, then on code-only prompts. Notably, we find that math-only RL not only significantly enhances the performance of strong distilled models on math benchmarks (e.g., +14.6% / +17.2% on AIME 2025 for the 7B / 14B models), but also code reasoning tasks (e.g., +6.8% / +5.8% on LiveCodeBench for the 7B / 14B models). In addition, extended code-only RL iterations further improve performance on code benchmarks with minimal or no degradation in math results. We develop a robust data curation pipeline to collect challenging prompts with high-quality, verifiable answers and test cases to enable verification-based RL across both domains. Finally, we identify key experimental insights, including curriculum learning with progressively increasing response lengths and the stabilizing effect of on-policy parameter updates. We find that RL not only elicits the foundational reasoning capabilities acquired during pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (e.g., distillation), but also pushes the limits of the model's reasoning ability, enabling it to solve problems that were previously unsolvable.</p></details> | <details><summary>We re...</summary><p>We release the models at: https://huggingface.co/collections/nvidia/acereason-682f4e1261dc22f697fd1485</p></details> |
| **[Enhancing LLM-Based Code Generation with Complexity Metrics: A Feedback-Driven Approach](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23953v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic code generation has gained significant momentum with the advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4. Although many studies focus on improving the effectiveness of LLMs for code generation, very limited work tries to understand the generated code's characteristics and leverage that to improve failed cases. In this paper, as the most straightforward characteristic of code, we investigate the relationship between code complexity and the success of LLM generated code. Using a large set of standard complexity metrics, we first conduct an empirical analysis to explore their correlation with LLM's performance on code generation (i.e., Pass@1). Using logistic regression models, we identify which complexity metrics are most predictive of code correctness. Building on these findings, we propose an iterative feedback method, where LLMs are prompted to generate correct code based on complexity metrics from previous failed outputs. We validate our approach across multiple benchmarks (i.e., HumanEval, MBPP, LeetCode, and BigCodeBench) and various LLMs (i.e., GPT-4o, GPT-3.5 Turbo, Llama 3.1, and GPT-o3 mini), comparing the results with two baseline methods: (a) zero-shot generation, and (b) iterative execution-based feedback without our code complexity insights. Experiment results show that our approach makes notable improvements, particularly with a smaller LLM (GPT3.5 Turbo), where, e.g., Pass@1 increased by 35.71% compared to the baseline's improvement of 12.5% on the HumanEval dataset. The study expands experiments to BigCodeBench and integrates the method with the Reflexion code generation agent, leading to Pass@1 improvements of 20% (GPT-4o) and 23.07% (GPT-o3 mini). The results highlight that complexity-aware feedback enhances both direct LLM prompting and agent-based workflows.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures.

| **[Lessons Learned: A Multi-Agent Framework for Code LLMs to Learn and Improve](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23946v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies show that LLMs possess different skills and specialize in different tasks. In fact, we observe that their varied performance occur in several levels of granularity. For example, in the code optimization task, code LLMs excel at different optimization categories and no one dominates others. This observation prompts the question of how one leverages multiple LLM agents to solve a coding problem without knowing their complementary strengths a priori. We argue that a team of agents can learn from each other's successes and failures so as to improve their own performance. Thus, a lesson is the knowledge produced by an agent and passed on to other agents in the collective solution process. We propose a lesson-based collaboration framework, design the lesson solicitation--banking--selection mechanism, and demonstrate that a team of small LLMs with lessons learned can outperform a much larger LLM and other multi-LLM collaboration methods.</p></details> |  |

We construct infinite sequences $(C_i)_{i \geq 1}$ of LCD codes and of LCPs $(C', D')_{i \geq 1}$ over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ obtained from the Garcia-Stichtenoth tower of function fields, where we describe suitable non-special divisors of small degree on each level of the tower. These families attain the Tsfasman-Vl\u{a}du\c{t}-Zink bound and, for sufficiently large $q$ exceed the classic Gilbert-Varshamov bound, providing explicit asymptotically good constructions beyond existential results. We also exhibit infinite sequences of self-orthogonal over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$ and, when $q$ is even, self-dual codes from the same tower all meeting the Tsfasman-Vl\u{a}du\c{t}-Zink bound.</p></details> | 18 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Optimizing Token Consumption in LLMs: A Nano Surge Approach for Code Reasoning Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.15989v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the increasing adoption of large language models (LLMs) in software engineering, the Chain of Thought (CoT) reasoning paradigm has become an essential approach for automated code repair. However, the explicit multi-step reasoning in CoT leads to substantial increases in token consumption, reducing inference efficiency and raising computational costs, especially for complex code repair tasks. Most prior research has focused on improving the correctness of code repair while largely overlooking the resource efficiency of the reasoning process itself. To address this challenge, this paper proposes three targeted optimization strategies: Context Awareness, Responsibility Tuning, and Cost Sensitive. Context Awareness guides the model to focus on key contextual information, Responsibility Tuning refines the structure of the reasoning process through clearer role and responsibility assignment, and Cost Sensitive incorporates resource-awareness to suppress unnecessary token generation during inference. Experiments across diverse code repair scenarios demonstrate that these methods can significantly reduce token consumption in CoT-based reasoning without compromising repair quality. This work provides novel insights and methodological guidance for enhancing the efficiency of LLM-driven code repair tasks in software engineering.</p></details> |  |
| **[On the Efficacy of the Peeling Decoder for the Quantum Expander Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.21845v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The problem of recovering from qubit erasures has recently gained attention as erasures occur in many physical systems such as photonic systems, trapped ions, superconducting qubits and circuit quantum electrodynamics. While several linear-time decoders for error correction are known, their error-correcting capability is limited to half the minimum distance of the code, whereas erasure correction allows one to go beyond this limit. As in the classical case, stopping sets pose a major challenge in designing efficient erasure decoders for quantum LDPC codes. In this paper, we show through simulation, that an attractive alternative here, is the use of quantum expander codes in conjunction with the peeling decoder that has linear complexity. We also discuss additional techniques including small-set-flip decoding, that can be applied following the peeling operation, to improve decoding performance and their associated complexity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthesizing Performance Constraints for Evaluating and Improving Code Efficiency](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23471v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly used to optimize code efficiency. Evaluating their effectiveness and further suggesting optimization opportunities often rely on high-quality tests to demonstrate the performance bottlenecks presented in the program. However, existing approaches rely on a limited set of hand-curated inputs or LLM-generated uninteresting length-stressing tests, failing to reveal more nuanced optimization opportunities. We present WEDGE, a framework for generating performance-stressing input given the program under test. WEDGE synthesizes explicit performance-characterizing constraints in the form of branch conditions to partition the programs' execution space into performance-specific regions. When integrated with the coverage-guided fuzzer, reaching different regions introduces explicit rewards for test generation to explore inefficient implementations. Our evaluation shows that WEDGE introduces a significant slowdown compared to the tests in CodeContests and those claimed to be optimized by existing approaches. From the utility perspective, integrating our tests substantially improves the existing code optimization approaches that rely on test-driven execution feedback. We release PERFFORGE, the performance tests generated by WEDGE, to benchmark future approaches for efficient code generation at https://github.com/UChiSeclab/perfforge.</p></details> | 30 pages, 3 figures |
| **[A Superposition Code-Based Semantic Communication Approach with Quantifiable and Controllable Security](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13980v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper addresses the challenge of achieving security in semantic communication (SemCom) over a wiretap channel, where a legitimate receiver coexists with an eavesdropper experiencing a poorer channel condition. Despite previous efforts to secure SemCom against eavesdroppers, guarantee of approximately zero information leakage remains an open issue. In this work, we propose a secure SemCom approach based on superposition codes, aiming to provide quantifiable and controllable security for digital SemCom systems. The proposed method employs a double-layered constellation map, where semantic information is associated with satellite constellation points and cloud center constellation points are randomly selected. By carefully allocating power between these two layers of constellation, we ensure that the symbol error probability (SEP) of the eavesdropper decoding satellite constellation points is nearly equivalent to random guessing, while maintaining a low SEP for the legitimate receiver to successfully decode the semantic information. Simulation results demonstrate that the peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and mean squared error (MSE) of the eavesdropper' s reconstructed data, under the proposed method, can range from decoding Gaussian-distributed random noise to approaching the variance of the data. This validates the effectiveness of our method in nearly achieving the experimental upper bound of security for digital SemCom systems when both eavesdroppers and legitimate users utilize identical decoding schemes. Furthermore, the proposed method consistently outperforms benchmark techniques, showcasing superior data security and robustness against eavesdropping.</p></details> |  |

However, existing code benchmarks remain static, consisting of fixed datasets with predefined problems. This makes them vulnerable to memorization during training, where LLMs recall specific test cases instead of generalizing to new problems, leading to data contamination and unreliable evaluation results. To address these issues, we introduce DynaCode, a dynamic, complexity-aware benchmark that overcomes the limitations of static datasets. DynaCode evaluates LLMs systematically using a complexity-aware metric, incorporating both code complexity and call-graph structures. DynaCode achieves large-scale diversity, generating up to 189 million unique nested code problems across four distinct levels of code complexity, referred to as units, and 16 types of call graphs. Results on 12 latest LLMs show an average performance drop of 16.8% to 45.7% compared to MBPP+, a static code generation benchmark, with performance progressively decreasing as complexity increases. This demonstrates DynaCode's ability to effectively differentiate LLMs. Additionally, by leveraging call graphs, we gain insights into LLM behavior, particularly their preference for handling subfunction interactions within nested code. Our benchmark and evaluation code are available at https://github.com/HWH-2000/DynaCode.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, 13 figures.

Classical PC was proposed as a top-down generative model, where the brain actively predicts upcoming visual inputs, and inference minimises the prediction errors. Recent studies have also shown that PC can be formulated as a discriminative model, where sensory inputs predict neural activities in a feedforward manner. However, experimental evidence suggests that the brain employs both generative and discriminative inference, while unidirectional PC models show degraded performance in tasks requiring bidirectional processing. In this work, we propose bidirectional PC (bPC), a PC model that incorporates both generative and discriminative inference while maintaining a biologically plausible circuit implementation. We show that bPC matches or outperforms unidirectional models in their specialised generative or discriminative tasks, by developing an energy landscape that simultaneously suits both tasks. We also demonstrate bPC's superior performance in two biologically relevant tasks including multimodal learning and inference with missing information, suggesting that bPC resembles biological visual inference more closely.</p></details> |  |

We introduce a bottom set of pure gaps and indicate that the set of pure gaps is completely determined by the bottom set. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a pure gap can be deduced from a known pure gap by easily verifying only one inequality. Then, in the case where $\lambda_1 = \lambda_2 = \cdots = \lambda_r$, we fully determine an explicit description of the set of pure gaps at many totally ramified places, This includes the scenario in which the set of these places contains the infinite place. Finally, we apply these results to construct multi-point algebraic geometry codes with good parameters. As one of the examples, a presented code with parameters $[74, 60, \geq 10]$ over $\mathbb{F}_{25}$ yields a new record.</p></details> | 35 pages |

A major challenge in understanding biochemical videos is detecting equipment, reagents, and containers because of the cluttered environment and indistinguishable objects. Previous studies assumed manual object annotation, which is costly and time-consuming. To address the issue, we focus on Micro QR Codes. However, detecting objects using only Micro QR Codes is still difficult due to blur and occlusion caused by object manipulation. To overcome this, we propose an object labeling method combining a Micro QR Code detector with an off-the-shelf hand object detector. As an application of the method and BioVL-QR, we tackled the task of localizing the procedural steps in an instructional video. The experimental results show that using Micro QR Codes and our method improves biochemical video understanding.

We introduce Infinite-Instruct, an automated framework for synthesizing high-quality question-answer pairs, designed to enhance the code generation capabilities of large language models (LLMs). The framework focuses on improving the internal logic of synthesized problems and the quality of synthesized code. First, "Reverse Construction" transforms code snippets into diverse programming problems. Then, through "Backfeeding Construction," keywords in programming problems are structured into a knowledge graph to reconstruct them into programming problems with stronger internal logic. Finally, a cross-lingual static code analysis pipeline filters invalid samples to ensure data quality. Experiments show that on mainstream code generation benchmarks, our fine-tuned models achieve an average performance improvement of 21.70% on 7B-parameter models and 36.95% on 32B-parameter models. Using less than one-tenth of the instruction fine-tuning data, we achieved performance comparable to the Qwen-2.5-Coder-Instruct. Infinite-Instruct provides a scalable solution for LLM training in programming. We open-source the datasets used in the experiments, including both unfiltered versions and filtered versions via static analysis.

| **[VERINA: Benchmarking Verifiable Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23135v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated in software development, but ensuring correctness in LLM-generated code remains challenging and often requires costly manual review. Verifiable code generation -- jointly generating code, specifications, and proofs of code-specification alignment -- offers a promising path to address this limitation and further unleash LLMs' benefits in coding. Yet, there exists a significant gap in evaluation: current benchmarks often lack support for end-to-end verifiable code generation. In this paper, we introduce Verina (Verifiable Code Generation Arena), a high-quality benchmark enabling a comprehensive and modular evaluation of code, specification, and proof generation as well as their compositions. Verina consists of 189 manually curated coding tasks in Lean, with detailed problem descriptions, reference implementations, formal specifications, and extensive test suites. Our extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art LLMs reveals significant challenges in verifiable code generation, especially in proof generation, underscoring the need for improving LLM-based theorem provers in verification domains. The best model, OpenAI o4-mini, generates only 61.4% correct code, 51.0% sound and complete specifications, and 3.6% successful proofs, with one trial per task. We hope Verina will catalyze progress in verifiable code generation by providing a rigorous and comprehensive benchmark. We release our dataset on https://huggingface.co/datasets/sunblaze-ucb/verina and our evaluation code on https://github.com/sunblaze-ucb/verina.</p></details> |  |
| **[Self-Correcting Code Generation Using Small Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.23060v1)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Self-correction has demonstrated potential in code generation by allowing language models to revise and improve their outputs through successive refinement. Recent studies have explored prompting-based strategies that incorporate verification or feedback loops using proprietary models, as well as training-based methods that leverage their strong reasoning capabilities. However, whether smaller models possess the capacity to effectively guide their outputs through self-reflection remains unexplored. Our findings reveal that smaller models struggle to exhibit reflective revision behavior across both self-correction paradigms. In response, we introduce CoCoS, an approach designed to enhance the ability of small language models for multi-turn code correction. Specifically, we propose an online reinforcement learning objective that trains the model to confidently maintain correct outputs while progressively correcting incorrect outputs as turns proceed. Our approach features an accumulated reward function that aggregates rewards across the entire trajectory and a fine-grained reward better suited to multi-turn correction scenarios. This facilitates the model in enhancing initial response quality while achieving substantial improvements through self-correction. With 1B-scale models, CoCoS achieves improvements of 35.8% on the MBPP and 27.7% on HumanEval compared to the baselines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differential Coding for Training-Free ANN-to-SNN Conversion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.00301v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) exhibit significant potential due to their low energy consumption. Converting Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) to SNNs is an efficient way to achieve high-performance SNNs. However, many conversion methods are based on rate coding, which requires numerous spikes and longer time-steps compared to directly trained SNNs, leading to increased energy consumption and latency. This article introduces differential coding for ANN-to-SNN conversion, a novel coding scheme that reduces spike counts and energy consumption by transmitting changes in rate information rather than rates directly, and explores its application across various layers. Additionally, the threshold iteration method is proposed to optimize thresholds based on activation distribution when converting Rectified Linear Units (ReLUs) to spiking neurons. Experimental results on various Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformers demonstrate that the proposed differential coding significantly improves accuracy while reducing energy consumption, particularly when combined with the threshold iteration method, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The source codes of the proposed method are available at https://github.com/h-z-h-cell/ANN-to-SNN-DCGS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chain of Grounded Objectives: Bridging Process and Goal-oriented Prompting for Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.13978v2)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) for code generation has gained significant attention in recent years. Existing methods often aim to improve the quality of generated code by incorporating additional contextual information or guidance into input prompts. Many of these approaches adopt sequential reasoning strategies, mimicking human-like step-by-step thinking. However, such strategies may constrain flexibility, as they do not always align with the structured characteristics of programming languages. This paper introduces the Chain of Grounded Objectives (CGO), a method that embeds functional objectives into input prompts to enhance code generation. By leveraging appropriately structured objectives as input and avoiding explicit sequential procedures, CGO adapts effectively to the structured nature of programming tasks. Empirical evaluations demonstrate that CGO effectively enhances code generation, addressing limitations of existing approaches.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ECOOP 2025 main conference</p></details> |

We introduce CodeSteer, an effective method for guiding LLM code/text generation. We construct a comprehensive benchmark SymBench comprising 37 symbolic tasks with adjustable complexity and also synthesize datasets of 12k multi-turn guidance/generation trajectories and 5.5k guidance comparison pairs. We fine-tune the Llama-3-8B model with a newly designed multi-turn supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and direct preference optimization (DPO). The resulting model, CodeSteerLLM, augmented with the proposed symbolic and self-answer checkers, effectively guides the code/text generation of larger models. Augmenting GPT-4o with CodeSteer raises its average performance score from 53.3 to 86.4, even outperforming the existing best LLM OpenAI o1 (82.7), o1-preview (74.8), and DeepSeek R1 (76.8) across all 37 tasks (28 seen, 9 unseen). Trained for GPT-4o, CodeSteer demonstrates superior generalizability, providing an average 41.8 performance boost on Claude, Mistral, and GPT-3.5. CodeSteer-guided LLMs fully harness symbolic computing to maintain strong performance on highly complex tasks.

| **[3DGS Compression with Sparsity-guided Hierarchical Transform Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22908v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has gained popularity for its fast and high-quality rendering, but it has a very large memory footprint incurring high transmission and storage overhead. Recently, some neural compression methods, such as Scaffold-GS, were proposed for 3DGS but they did not adopt the approach of end-to-end optimized analysis-synthesis transforms which has been proven highly effective in neural signal compression. Without an appropriate analysis transform, signal correlations cannot be removed by sparse representation. Without such transforms the only way to remove signal redundancies is through entropy coding driven by a complex and expensive context modeling, which results in slower speed and suboptimal rate-distortion (R-D) performance. To overcome this weakness, we propose Sparsity-guided Hierarchical Transform Coding (SHTC), the first end-to-end optimized transform coding framework for 3DGS compression. SHTC jointly optimizes the 3DGS, transforms and a lightweight context model. This joint optimization enables the transform to produce representations that approach the best R-D performance possible. The SHTC framework consists of a base layer using KLT for data decorrelation, and a sparsity-coded enhancement layer that compresses the KLT residuals to refine the representation. The enhancement encoder learns a linear transform to project high-dimensional inputs into a low-dimensional space, while the decoder unfolds the Iterative Shrinkage-Thresholding Algorithm (ISTA) to reconstruct the residuals. All components are designed to be interpretable, allowing the incorporation of signal priors and fewer parameters than black-box transforms. This novel design significantly improves R-D performance with minimal additional parameters and computational overhead.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training Language Models to Generate Quality Code with Program Analysis Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22704v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation with large language models (LLMs), often termed vibe coding, is increasingly adopted in production but fails to ensure code quality, particularly in security (e.g., SQL injection vulnerabilities) and maintainability (e.g., missing type annotations). Existing methods, such as supervised fine-tuning and rule-based post-processing, rely on labor-intensive annotations or brittle heuristics, limiting their scalability and effectiveness. We propose REAL, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes LLMs to generate production-quality code using program analysis-guided feedback. Specifically, REAL integrates two automated signals: (1) program analysis detecting security or maintainability defects and (2) unit tests ensuring functional correctness. Unlike prior work, our framework is prompt-agnostic and reference-free, enabling scalable supervision without manual intervention. Experiments across multiple datasets and model scales demonstrate that REAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in simultaneous assessments of functionality and code quality. Our work bridges the gap between rapid prototyping and production-ready code, enabling LLMs to deliver both speed and quality.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |
| **[Bivariate Linear Operator Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.16596v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we present a generalization of the linear operator family of codes that captures more codes that achieve list decoding capacity. Linear operator (LO) codes were introduced by Bhandari, Harsha, Kumar, and Sudan [BHKS24] as a way to capture capacity-achieving codes. In their framework, a code is specified by a collection of linear operators that are applied to a message polynomial and then evaluated at a specified set of evaluation points. We generalize this idea in a way that can be applied to bivariate message polynomials, getting what we call bivariate linear operator (B-LO) codes. We show that bivariate linear operator codes capture more capacity-achieving codes, including permuted product codes introduced by Berman, Shany, and Tamo [BST24]. These codes work with bivariate message polynomials, which is why our generalization is necessary to capture them as a part of the linear operator framework. Similarly to the initial paper on linear operator codes, we present sufficient conditions for a bivariate linear operator code to be list decodable. Using this characterization, we are able to derive the theorem characterizing list-decodability of LO codes as a specific case of our theorem for B-LO codes. We also apply this theorem to show that permuted product codes are list decodable up to capacity, thereby unifying this result with those of known list-decodable LO codes, including Folded Reed-Solomon, Multiplicity, and Affine Folded Reed-Solomon codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Function-Correcting Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.15135v6)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Function-correcting codes were introduced in the work "Function-Correcting Codes" (FCC) by Lenz et al. 2023, which provides a graphical representation for the problem of constructing function-correcting codes. We use this function dependent graph to get a lower bound on the redundancy required for function correction codes. By considering the function to be a bijection, such an approach leads to a lower bound on the redundancy required for classical systematic error correcting codes (ECCs). We propose a range of parameters for which the bound is tight. For single error correcting codes, we show that this bound is at least as good as a bound proposed by Zinoviev, Litsyn, and Laihonen in 1998. Thus, this framework helps to study systematic classical error correcting codes. Further, we study the structure of this function dependent graph for linear functions, which leads to bounds on the redundancy of linear-function correcting codes. We show that the Plotkin-like bound for function-correcting codes proposed by Lenz et.al 2023 is simplified for linear functions. We identify a class of linear functions for which an upper bound proposed by Lenz et al., is tight and also identify a class of functions for which coset-wise coding is equivalent to a lower dimensional classical error correction problem.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication in IEEE Transactions on Information Theory; Recent arXiv publications on Function-Correcting Codes added; 15 pages (double column), 6 figures and one table</p></details> |

The goal is to identify challenges in mixed-ability collaboration, particularly when sighted programmers work with blind peers or teach programming to blind students. To overcome limitations of traditional blindness simulation studies, we proposed Task-Oriented Priming and Sensory Alignment (ToPSen), a design framework that reframes sensory constraints as technical requirements rather than as a disability. Through a study of 12 blind and 12 sighted participants coding non-visually, we found that expert blind programmers maintain more accurate mental models and process more information in working memory than sighted programmers using ToPSen. Our analysis revealed that blind and sighted programmers process structural information differently, exposing gaps in current IDE designs. These insights inform our guidelines for improving the accessibility of programming tools and fostering effective mixed-ability collaboration.</p></details> | Accepted at DIS'25 |

A Case Study on English-Korean Code-Switching](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18436v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent large language models (LLMs) demonstrate multilingual abilities, yet they are English-centric due to dominance of English in training corpora. The limited resource for low-resource languages remains a crucial challenge. Code-switching (CS), a phenomenon where multilingual speakers alternate between languages in a discourse, can convey subtle cultural and linguistic nuances that can be otherwise lost in translation and elicits language-specific knowledge in human communications. In light of this, we investigate whether code-switching can 'activate', or identify and leverage knowledge for reasoning when LLMs solve low-resource language tasks. To facilitate the research, we first present EnKoQA, a synthetic English-Korean CS question-answering dataset. We provide comprehensive analysis on a variety of multilingual LLMs by subdividing activation process into knowledge identification and knowledge leveraging. Our results demonstrate that compared to English text, CS can faithfully activate knowledge inside LLMs especially on language-specific domains, suggesting the potential of code-switching on low-resource language tasks.</p></details> | 25 pages, 8 figures |

Due to excellent capacity-achieving performance, spatially-coupled low-density parity-check (SC-LDPC) codes are considered a promising candidate for next-generation channel coding. In this paper, we propose an SC-LDPC code family called edge-spreading Raptor-like (ESRL) codes. Unlike other SC-LDPC codes that adopt the structure of existing rate-compatible LDPC block codes before coupling, ESRL codes maximize the possible locations of edge placement and focus on constructing an optimal coupled matrix. Moreover, a new graph representation called the unified graph is introduced. This graph offers a global perspective on ESRL codes and identifies the optimal edge reallocation to optimize the spreading strategy. We conduct comprehensive comparisons of ESRL codes and 5G-NR LDPC codes. Simulation results demonstrate that when all decoding parameters and complexity are the same, ESRL codes have obvious advantages in error rate performance and throughput compared to 5G-NR LDPC codes in some specific scenarios (low and high number of iterations), making them a promising solution towards next-generation channel coding.</p></details> | <details><summary>accep...</summary><p>accepted by IEEE Transactions on Communications</p></details> |
| **[Towards Practical Defect-Focused Automated Code Review](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17928v2)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The complexity of code reviews has driven efforts to automate review comments, but prior approaches oversimplify this task by treating it as snippet-level code-to-text generation and relying on text similarity metrics like BLEU for evaluation. These methods overlook repository context, real-world merge request evaluation, and defect detection, limiting their practicality. To address these issues, we explore the full automation pipeline within the online recommendation service of a company with nearly 400 million daily active users, analyzing industry-grade C++ codebases comprising hundreds of thousands of lines of code. We identify four key challenges: 1) capturing relevant context, 2) improving key bug inclusion (KBI), 3) reducing false alarm rates (FAR), and 4) integrating human workflows. To tackle these, we propose 1) code slicing algorithms for context extraction, 2) a multi-role LLM framework for KBI, 3) a filtering mechanism for FAR reduction, and 4) a novel prompt design for better human interaction. Our approach, validated on real-world merge requests from historical fault reports, achieves a 2x improvement over standard LLMs and a 10x gain over previous baselines. While the presented results focus on C++, the underlying framework design leverages language-agnostic principles (e.g., AST-based analysis), suggesting potential for broader applicability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted as Spotlight at the 42nd International Conference on Machine Learning (ICML 2025)</p></details> |
| **[Interpolation of Quantum Polar Codes and Quantum Reed-Muller Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22142v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Good quantum error-correcting codes that fulfill practical considerations, such as simple encoding circuits and efficient decoders, are essential for functional quantum information processing systems. Quantum polar codes satisfy some of these requirements but lack certain critical features, thereby hindering their widespread use. Existing constructions either require entanglement assistance to produce valid quantum codes, suffer from poor finite-size performance, or fail to tailor polar codes to the underlying channel properties. Meanwhile, quantum Reed-Muller (RM) codes demonstrate strong performance, though no known efficient decoding algorithm exists for them. In this work, we propose strategies to interpolate between quantum polar codes and quantum RM codes, thus addressing the challenges of designing valid quantum polar codes without entanglement assistance and improving finite-size code performance.</p></details> |  |

This paper introduces the Feedback-Aided Coding and Energy Transfer (FACET) framework, which synergistically combines adaptive feedback channel coding with wireless power transfer. FACET leverages the saturation effect of feedback coding, where increasing downlink power yields diminishing returns, to design a dual-purpose feedback mechanism that simultaneously guides uplink coding and replenishes device energy. We characterize the inherent tradeoff between feedback precision and harvested power, and formulate a fairness-constrained min-max optimization problem to minimize worst-case net energy consumption. An efficient algorithm based on alternating optimization and Lagrangian duality is developed, with each subproblem admitting a closed-form solution. Simulations show that FACET nearly triples device lifetime compared to conventional feedback coding architectures, and remains robust across a wide range of power regimes. These results suggest that FACET not only improves communication efficiency but also redefines the role of feedback in energy-constrained IoT systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for Out-of-Distribution Reasoning in LLMs: An Empirical Study on Diagnosis-Related Group Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21908v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) codes are essential for hospital reimbursement and operations but require labor-intensive assignment. Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with DRG coding due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) nature of the task: pretraining corpora rarely contain private clinical or billing data. We introduce DRG-Sapphire, which uses large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for automated DRG coding from clinical notes. Built on Qwen2.5-7B and trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using rule-based rewards, DRG-Sapphire introduces a series of RL enhancements to address domain-specific challenges not seen in previous mathematical tasks. Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the MIMIC-IV benchmark and generates physician-validated reasoning for DRG assignments, significantly enhancing explainability. Our study further sheds light on broader challenges of applying RL to knowledge-intensive, OOD tasks. We observe that RL performance scales approximately linearly with the logarithm of the number of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) examples, suggesting that RL effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the domain knowledge encoded in the base model. For OOD tasks like DRG coding, strong RL performance requires sufficient knowledge infusion prior to RL. Consequently, scaling SFT may be more effective and computationally efficient than scaling RL alone for such tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[Edit Distance Robust Watermarks via Indexing Pseudorandom Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.02633v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Motivated by the problem of detecting AI-generated text, we consider the problem of watermarking the output of language models with provable guarantees. We aim for watermarks which satisfy: (a) undetectability, a cryptographic notion introduced by Christ, Gunn & Zamir (2024) which stipulates that it is computationally hard to distinguish watermarked language model outputs from the model's actual output distribution; and (b) robustness to channels which introduce a constant fraction of adversarial insertions, substitutions, and deletions to the watermarked text. Earlier schemes could only handle stochastic substitutions and deletions, and thus we are aiming for a more natural and appealing robustness guarantee that holds with respect to edit distance. Our main result is a watermarking scheme which achieves both undetectability and robustness to edits when the alphabet size for the language model is allowed to grow as a polynomial in the security parameter. To derive such a scheme, we follow an approach introduced by Christ & Gunn (2024), which proceeds via first constructing pseudorandom codes satisfying undetectability and robustness properties analogous to those above; our key idea is to handle adversarial insertions and deletions by interpreting the symbols as indices into the codeword, which we call indexing pseudorandom codes. Additionally, our codes rely on weaker computational assumptions than used in previous work. Then we show that there is a generic transformation from such codes over large alphabets to watermarking schemes for arbitrary language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appea...</summary><p>Appeared in NeurIPS 2024</p></details> |

Current approaches predominantly treat CSI compression as a source coding problem, neglecting transmission errors. In finite block length regimes, separate source and channel coding proves suboptimal, with reconstruction performance deteriorating significantly under challenging channel conditions. While existing autoencoder-based compression schemes can be readily extended to support joint source-channel coding, they struggle to capture complex channel distributions and exhibit poor scalability with increasing parameter count. To overcome these inherent limitations of autoencoder-based approaches, we propose Residual-Diffusion Joint Source-Channel Coding (RD-JSCC), a novel framework that integrates a lightweight autoencoder with a residual diffusion module to iteratively refine CSI reconstruction. Our flexible decoding strategy balances computational efficiency and performance by dynamically switching between low-complexity autoencoder decoding and sophisticated diffusion-based refinement based on channel conditions. Comprehensive simulations demonstrate that RD-JSCC significantly outperforms existing autoencoder-based approaches in challenging wireless environments. Furthermore, RD-JSCC offers several practical features, including a low-latency 2-step diffusion during inference, support for multiple compression rates with a single model, robustness to fixed-bit quantization, and adaptability to imperfect channel estimation.</p></details> | 13 pages, 11 figures |

A key challenge is enabling LLMs to decide when to use textual reasoning versus code generation. While OpenAI trains models to invoke a Code Interpreter as needed, public research lacks guidance on aligning pre-trained LLMs to effectively leverage code and generalize across diverse tasks. We present R1-Code-Interpreter, an extension of a text-only LLM trained via multi-turn supervised fine-tuning (SFT) and reinforcement learning (RL) to autonomously generate multiple code queries during step-by-step reasoning. We curate 144 reasoning and planning tasks (107 for training, 37 for testing), each with over 200 diverse questions. We fine-tune Qwen-2.5 models (3B/7B/14B) using various SFT and RL strategies, investigating different answer formats, reasoning vs. non-reasoning models, cold vs. warm starts, GRPO vs. PPO, and masked vs. unmasked code outputs. Unlike prior RL work on narrow domains, we find that Code Interpreter training is significantly harder due to high task diversity and expensive code execution, highlighting the critical role of the SFT stage. Our final model, R1-CI-14B, improves average accuracy on the 37 test tasks from 44.0\% to 64.1\%, outperforming GPT-4o (text-only: 58.6\%) and approaching GPT-4o with Code Interpreter (70.9\%), with the emergent self-checking behavior via code generation.

However, as external components, CoT models are particularly vulnerable to backdoor attacks, which existing defense mechanisms often fail to detect effectively. To address this challenge, we propose GUARD, a novel dual-agent defense framework specifically designed to counter CoT backdoor attacks in neural code generation. GUARD integrates two core components: GUARD-Judge, which identifies suspicious CoT steps and potential triggers through comprehensive analysis, and GUARD-Repair, which employs a retrieval-augmented generation approach to regenerate secure CoT steps for identified anomalies. Experimental results show that GUARD effectively mitigates attacks while maintaining generation quality, advancing secure code generation systems.</p></details> | under review |

We introduce rStar-Coder, which significantly improves LLM code reasoning capabilities by constructing a large-scale, verified dataset of 418K competition-level code problems, 580K long-reasoning solutions along with rich test cases of varying difficulty. This is achieved through three core contributions: (1) we curate competitive programming code problems and oracle solutions to synthesize new, solvable problems; (2) we introduce a reliable input-output test case synthesis pipeline that decouples the generation into a three-step input generation method and a mutual verification mechanism for effective output labeling; (3) we augment problems with high-quality, test-case-verified long-reasoning solutions. Extensive experiments on Qwen models (1.5B-14B) across various code reasoning benchmarks demonstrate the superiority of rStar-Coder dataset, achieving leading performance comparable to frontier reasoning LLMs with much smaller model sizes. On LiveCodeBench, rStar-Coder improves Qwen2.5-7B from 17.4% to an impressive 57.3%, and Qwen2.5-14B from 23.3% to 62.5%, surpassing o3-mini (low) by3.1%. On the more challenging USA Computing Olympiad, our 7B model achieves an average pass@1 accuracy of 16.15%, outperforming the frontier-level QWQ-32B.

This paper introduces JavaSith, a novel client-side framework for analyzing potentially malicious extensions in web browsers, Visual Studio Code (VSCode), and Node's NPM packages. JavaSith combines a runtime sandbox that emulates browser/Node.js extension APIs (with a ``time machine'' to accelerate time-based triggers) with static analysis and a local large language model (LLM) to assess risk from code and metadata. We present the design and architecture of JavaSith, including techniques for intercepting extension behavior over simulated time and extracting suspicious patterns. Through case studies on real-world attacks (such as a supply-chain compromise of a Chrome extension and malicious VSCode extensions installing cryptominers), we demonstrate how JavaSith can catch stealthy malicious behaviors that evade traditional detection. We evaluate the framework's effectiveness and discuss its limitations and future enhancements. JavaSith's client-side approach empowers end-users/organizations to vet extensions and packages before trustingly integrating them into their environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages , 11 figures</p></details> |

We introduce a conceptual framework through a case study in science: uncovering hidden rules in peer review - the factors that reviewers care about but rarely state explicitly due to normative scientific expectations. The idea of the framework is to push LLMs to speak out their heuristics through generating self-consistent hypotheses - why one paper appeared stronger in reviewer scoring - among paired papers submitted to 45 computer science conferences, while iteratively searching deeper hypotheses from remaining pairs where existing hypotheses cannot explain. We observed that LLMs' normative priors about the internal characteristics of good science extracted from their self-talk, e.g. theoretical rigor, were systematically updated toward posteriors that emphasize storytelling about external connections, such as how the work is positioned and connected within and across literatures. This shift reveals the primacy of scientific myths about intrinsic properties driving scientific excellence rather than extrinsic contextualization and storytelling that influence conceptions of relevance and significance. Human reviewers tend to explicitly reward aspects that moderately align with LLMs' normative priors (correlation = 0.49) but avoid articulating contextualization and storytelling posteriors in their review comments (correlation = -0.14), despite giving implicit reward to them with positive scores. We discuss the broad applicability of the framework, leveraging LLMs as diagnostic tools to surface the tacit codes underlying human society, enabling more precisely targeted responsible AI.</p></details> |  |

Recent code language models have scaled to billions of parameters, but model source code solely as text tokens while ignoring any other structural information. Conversely, models that do encode structural information of code make modifications to the Transformer architecture, limiting their scale and compatibility with pretrained LLMs. In this work, we take the best of both worlds with GALLa - Graph Aligned Large Language Models. GALLa utilizes graph neural networks and cross-modal alignment technologies to inject the structural information of code into LLMs as an auxiliary task during finetuning. This framework is both model-agnostic and task-agnostic, as it can be applied to any code LLM for any code downstream task, and requires the structural graph data only at training time from a corpus unrelated to the finetuning data, while incurring no cost at inference time over the baseline LLM. Experiments on five code tasks with seven different baseline LLMs ranging in size from 350M to 14B validate the effectiveness of GALLa, demonstrating consistent improvement over the baseline, even for powerful models such as LLaMA3 and Qwen2.5-Coder.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 camera-ready</p></details> |
| **[Computational Reproducibility of R Code Supplements on OSF](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21590v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computational reproducibility is fundamental to scientific research, yet many published code supplements lack the necessary documentation to recreate their computational environments. While researchers increasingly share code alongside publications, the actual reproducibility of these materials remains poorly understood. In this work, we assess the computational reproducibility of 296 R projects using the StatCodeSearch dataset. Of these, only 264 were still retrievable, and 98.8% lacked formal dependency descriptions required for successful execution. To address this, we developed an automated pipeline that reconstructs computational environments directly from project source code. Applying this pipeline, we executed the R scripts within custom Docker containers and found that 25.87% completed successfully without error. We conducted a detailed analysis of execution failures, identifying reproducibility barriers such as undeclared dependencies, invalid file paths, and system-level issues. Our findings show that automated dependency inference and containerisation can support scalable verification of computational reproducibility and help identify practical obstacles to code reuse and transparency in scientific research.</p></details> |  |

Efficient Code Generation with Thorough Exploration and Optimal Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17442v2)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation is crucial in software engineering for automating the coding process efficiently. While test-time computation methods show promise, they suffer from high latency due to multiple computation rounds. To overcome this, we introduce \textbf{ThinkCoder}, a framework that combines thorough exploration with optimal refinement. The exploration phase diversifies the solution space by searching for potential solutions, followed by a refinement phase that enhances precision. This approach allows us to select the best solution through careful consideration before taking action, avoiding excessive trial and error. To further minimize test-time computation overhead, we introduce preference-driven optimization with Reinforced Self-Training (ReST), which uses exploration trajectories from ThinkCoder to guide LLM's evolution. This approach enhances LLM's exploration efficiency via preference learning, cutting costs while maintaining accuracy. ThinkCoder boosts the performance with a single LLM, excelling on benchmarks like HumanEval and MBPP. Compared to SOTA models, it improves Pass@1 by 3.0\% over MapCoder with just 6.4\% of the computation cost. Against AgentCoder, ThinkCoder achieves a 0.5\% higher Pass@1 after 2 rounds, outperforming AgentCoder's 5 rounds. Additionally, ReST with success trajectories enhances efficiency, allowing models like LLaMA2-7B to achieve competitive results using only 20\% of the computational resources. These results highlight the framework's effectiveness and scalability.</p></details> | <details><summary>14 pa...</summary><p>14 pages, 10 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

We show that using it to convert utterances to the symbolic program is feasible, despite the very small training dataset. Human experiments show that dialogue is critical to successful simulation generation, leading to a 4.5 times higher success rate than a generation without engaging in extended conversation.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 5 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |

This survey systematically reviews RL-driven techniques across the code development lifecycle, from compiler-level optimizations and resource allocation strategies to end-to-end code synthesis frameworks. We first examine classical and modern RL algorithms -- spanning policy gradients, actor-critic methods, human-feedback alignment, and preference-based optimization -- and their adaptations to the unique challenges of code generation, such as sparse and delayed rewards. Next, we analyze key benchmarks, datasets, and evaluation metrics that drive progress in RL-augmented Code LLMs. Finally, we identify open problems, including the need for richer feedback sources, support for low-level and domain-specific languages, and methods to reduce computational overhead. By consolidating current insights and outlining future directions, this work aims to guide researchers and practitioners in leveraging RL to produce more robust, efficient, and human-aligned code generation systems.</p></details> |  |

However, interpreting charts with textual descriptions often leads to information loss, as it fails to fully capture the dense information embedded in charts. In contrast, parsing charts into code provides lossless representations that can effectively contain all critical details. Although existing open-source MLLMs have achieved success in chart understanding tasks, they still face two major challenges when applied to chart-to-code tasks: (1) Low executability and poor restoration of chart details in the generated code and (2) Lack of large-scale and diverse training data. To address these challenges, we propose \textbf{ChartCoder}, the first dedicated chart-to-code MLLM, which leverages Code LLMs as the language backbone to enhance the executability of the generated code. Furthermore, we introduce \textbf{Chart2Code-160k}, the first large-scale and diverse dataset for chart-to-code generation, and propose the \textbf{Snippet-of-Thought (SoT)} method, which transforms direct chart-to-code generation data into step-by-step generation. Experiments demonstrate that ChartCoder, with only 7B parameters, surpasses existing open-source MLLMs on chart-to-code benchmarks, achieving superior chart restoration and code excitability.

While studies have examined LLM capabilities in tasks like vulnerability detection and repair, they often overlook the importance of both structure and semantic reasoning crucial for trustworthy vulnerability analysis. To address this gap, we introduce SV-TrustEval-C, a benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' abilities for vulnerability analysis of code written in the C programming language through two key dimensions: structure reasoning - assessing how models identify relationships between code elements under varying data and control flow complexities; and semantic reasoning - examining their logical consistency in scenarios where code is structurally and semantically perturbed. Our results show that current LLMs are far from satisfactory in understanding complex code relationships and that their vulnerability analyses rely more on pattern matching than on robust logical reasoning. These findings underscore the effectiveness of the SV-TrustEval-C benchmark and highlight critical areas for enhancing the reasoning capabilities and trustworthiness of LLMs in real-world vulnerability analysis tasks. Our initial benchmark dataset is publicly available.</p></details> |  |

Unlike traditional static benchmarks, SwingArena models the collaborative process of software iteration by pairing LLMs as submitters, who generate patches, and reviewers, who create test cases and verify the patches through continuous integration (CI) pipelines. To support these interactive evaluations, we introduce a retrieval-augmented code generation (RACG) module that efficiently handles long-context challenges by providing syntactically and semantically relevant code snippets from large codebases, supporting multiple programming languages (C++, Python, Rust, and Go). This enables the framework to scale across diverse tasks and contexts while respecting token limitations. Our experiments, using over 400 high-quality real-world GitHub issues selected from a pool of 2,300 issues, show that models like GPT-4o excel at aggressive patch generation, whereas DeepSeek and Gemini prioritize correctness in CI validation. SwingArena presents a scalable and extensible methodology for evaluating LLMs in realistic, CI-driven software development settings.

A mixed-methods study](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.16764v2)** | 2025-06-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In many application domains, domain-specific languages can allow domain experts to contribute to collaborative projects more correctly and efficiently. To do so, they must be able to understand program structure from reading existing source code. With high-quality data becoming an increasingly important resource, the creation of data pipelines is an important application domain for domain-specific languages. We execute a mixed-method study consisting of a controlled experiment and a follow-up descriptive survey among the participants to understand the effects of a domain-specific language on bottom-up program understanding and generate hypotheses for future research. During the experiment, participants need the same time to solve program structure comprehension tasks, but are significantly more correct when using the domain-specific language. In the descriptive survey, participants describe reasons related to the programming language itself, such as a better pipeline overview, more enforced code structure, and a closer alignment to the mental model of a data pipeline. In addition, human factors such as less required programming experience and the ability to reuse experience from other data engineering tools are discussed. Based on these results, domain-specific languages are a promising tool for creating data pipelines that can increase correct understanding of program structure and lower barriers to entry for domain experts. Open questions exist to make more informed implementation decisions for domain-specific languages for data pipelines in the future.</p></details> | <details><summary>Use o...</summary><p>Use of standard two-sided hypothesis tests and improved presentation</p></details> |

Primal heuristics play a crucial role in quickly finding feasible solutions for NP-hard ILP. Although $\textit{end-to-end learning}$-based primal heuristics (E2EPH) have recently been proposed, they are typically unable to independently generate feasible solutions and mainly focus on binary variables. Ensuring feasibility is critical, especially when handling non-binary integer variables. To address this challenge, we propose RL-SPH, a novel reinforcement learning-based start primal heuristic capable of independently generating feasible solutions, even for ILP involving non-binary integers. Experimental results demonstrate that RL-SPH rapidly obtains high-quality feasible solutions, achieving on average a 44x lower primal gap and a 2.3x lower primal integral compared to existing primal heuristics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version (19 pages, 7 figures).

Despite its potential, current software stacks for DRAM-PIM face significant challenges, including reliance on hand-tuned libraries that hinder programmability, limited support for high-level abstractions, and the lack of systematic optimization frameworks. To address these limitations, we present ATiM, a search-based optimizing tensor compiler for UPMEM. Key features of ATiM include: (1) automated searches of the joint search space for host and kernel tensor programs, (2) PIM-aware optimizations for efficiently handling boundary conditions, and (3) improved search algorithms for the expanded search space of UPMEM systems. Our experimental results on UPMEM hardware demonstrate performance gains of up to 6.18$\times$ for various UPMEM benchmark kernels and 8.21$\times$ for GPT-J layers. To the best of our knowledge, ATiM is the first tensor compiler to provide fully automated, autotuning-integrated code generation support for a DRAM-PIM system. By bridging the gap between high-level tensor computation abstractions and low-level hardware-specific requirements, ATiM establishes a foundation for advancing DRAM-PIM programmability and enabling streamlined optimization.</p></details> | 17 pages, 15 figures |

Further, the use of artificial neural networks in symbolic learning has been seen as increasingly relevant recently. To study the capabilities of neural networks in the symbolic AI domain, researchers have explored the ability of deep neural networks to learn mathematical constructions, such as addition and multiplication, logic inference, such as theorem provers, and even the execution of computer programs. The latter is known to be too complex a task for neural networks. Therefore, the results were not always successful, and often required the introduction of biased elements in the learning process, in addition to restricting the scope of possible programs to be executed. In this work, we will analyze the ability of neural networks to learn how to execute programs as a whole. To do so, we propose a different approach. Instead of using an imperative programming language, with complex structures, we use the Lambda Calculus ({\lambda}-Calculus), a simple, but Turing-Complete mathematical formalism, which serves as the basis for modern functional programming languages and is at the heart of computability theory. We will introduce the use of integrated neural learning and lambda calculi formalization. Finally, we explore execution of a program in {\lambda}-Calculus is based on reductions, we will show that it is enough to learn how to perform these reductions so that we can execute any program.

Current evaluations, however, predominantly measure the accuracy of generated code on static benchmarks, neglecting the critical aspect of model robustness during programming tasks. While adversarial attacks offer insights on model robustness, their effectiveness is limited and evaluation could be constrained. Current adversarial attack methods for robustness evaluation yield inconsistent results, struggling to provide a unified evaluation across different LLMs. We introduce EVALOOP, a novel assessment framework that evaluate the robustness from a self-consistency perspective, i.e., leveraging the natural duality inherent in popular software engineering tasks, e.g., code generation and code summarization. EVALOOP initiates a self-contained feedback loop: an LLM generates output (e.g., code) from an input (e.g., natural language specification), and then use the generated output as the input to produce a new output (e.g., summarizes that code into a new specification). EVALOOP repeats the process to assess the effectiveness of EVALOOP in each loop. This cyclical strategy intrinsically evaluates robustness without rely on any external attack setups, providing a unified metric to evaluate LLMs' robustness in programming. We evaluate 16 prominent LLMs (e.g., GPT-4.1, O4-mini) on EVALOOP and found that EVALOOP typically induces a 5.01%-19.31% absolute drop in pass@1 performance within ten loops. Intriguingly, robustness does not always align with initial performance (i.e., one-time query); for instance, GPT-3.5-Turbo, despite superior initial code generation compared to DeepSeek-V2, demonstrated lower robustness over repeated evaluation loop.</p></details> | 19 pages, 11 figures |

However, are the abstract reasoning abilities of these models general enough for problems of practical importance? Unlike past work, which has focused mainly on math, coding, and data wrangling, we focus on a historical linguistics-inspired inductive reasoning problem, formulated as Programming by Examples. We develop a fully automated pipeline for dynamically generating a benchmark for this task with controllable difficulty in order to tackle scalability and contamination issues to which many reasoning benchmarks are subject. Using our pipeline, we generate a test set with nearly 1k instances that is challenging for all state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs, with the best model (Claude-3.7-Sonnet) achieving a mere 54% pass rate, demonstrating that LCoT LLMs still struggle with a class or reasoning that is ubiquitous in historical linguistics as well as many other domains.</p></details> |  |

To mitigate this problem, we propose a tool-assisted method for formally specifying and automatically verifying the correctness of statistical programs. In this method, programmers are required to annotate the source code of the statistical programs with the requirements for these methods. Through this annotation, they are reminded to check the requirements for statistical methods, including those that cannot be formally verified, such as the distribution of the unknown true population. Our software tool StatWhy automatically checks whether programmers have properly specified the requirements for the statistical methods, thereby identifying any missing requirements that need to be addressed. This tool is implemented using the Why3 platform to verify the correctness of OCaml programs that conduct statistical hypothesis testing. We demonstrate how StatWhy can be used to avoid common errors in various statistical hypothesis testing programs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to CAV 2025 (the 37th International Conference on Computer Aided Verification)</p></details> |

However, existing benchmarks lack the ability to automatically evaluate from users' perspective, and also lack the explainability of the results of LLM agents' code generation capabilities. Thus, we introduce ProjectEval, a new benchmark for LLM agents project-level code generation's automated evaluation by simulating user interaction. ProjectEval is constructed by LLM with human reviewing. It has three different level inputs of natural languages or code skeletons. ProjectEval can evaluate the generated projects by user interaction simulation for execution, and by code similarity through existing objective indicators. Through ProjectEval, we find that systematic engineering project code, overall understanding of the project and comprehensive analysis capability are the keys for LLM agents to achieve practical projects.

To address this problem, we propose TrickCatcher, an LLM-powered approach to generating test cases for uncovering bugs in plausible programs. TrickCatcher operates in three stages: First, it uses an LLM to generate program variants based on the program under test (PUT) and its specification. Second, it employs an LLM to construct an input generator from the specification for producing test inputs. Finally, these inputs are executed on both the PUT and its program variants to detect inconsistencies in their outputs. We evaluate TrickCatcher on two datasets, TrickyBugs and EvalPlus, which include 366 human-written and 151 AI-generated plausible programs with tricky bugs. TrickCatcher achieves recall, precision, and F1 scores that are 1.80x, 2.65x, and 1.66x those of the state-of-the-art baselines, respectively.

In large codebases like the Linux kernel, traditional static analysis tools often generate excessive false positives due to simplified vulnerability modeling and overapproximation of path and data constraints. While large language models (LLMs) demonstrate promising code understanding capabilities, their direct application to program analysis remains unreliable due to inherent reasoning limitations. We introduce BugLens, a post-refinement framework that significantly enhances static analysis precision for bug detection. BugLens guides LLMs through structured reasoning steps to assess security impact and validate constraints from the source code. When evaluated on Linux kernel taint-style bugs detected by static analysis tools, BugLens improves precision approximately 7-fold (from 0.10 to 0.72), substantially reducing false positives while uncovering four previously unreported vulnerabilities. Our results demonstrate that a well-structured, fully automated LLM-based workflow can effectively complement and enhance traditional static analysis techniques.</p></details> |  |

Although classical architectures typically implement variable binding via addressable memory, it is not well understood how modern neural networks lacking built-in binding operations may acquire this capacity. We investigate this by training a Transformer to dereference queried variables in symbolic programs where variables are assigned either numerical constants or other variables. Each program requires following chains of variable assignments up to four steps deep to find the queried value, and also contains irrelevant chains of assignments acting as distractors. Our analysis reveals a developmental trajectory with three distinct phases during training: (1) random prediction of numerical constants, (2) a shallow heuristic prioritizing early variable assignments, and (3) the emergence of a systematic mechanism for dereferencing assignment chains. Using causal interventions, we find that the model learns to exploit the residual stream as an addressable memory space, with specialized attention heads routing information across token positions. This mechanism allows the model to dynamically track variable bindings across layers, resulting in accurate dereferencing. Our results show how Transformer models can learn to implement systematic variable binding without explicit architectural support, bridging connectionist and symbolic approaches.

Finite incremental gains provide a quantitative measure of robustness for trajectories, and will ensure that all pairs of trajectories will converge to a fixed point or will diverge together in the absence of an applied input. Upper-bounds on these incremental gains can be computed through linear programming.

| **[Improving Parallel Program Performance with LLM Optimizers via Agent-System Interfaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.15625v4)** | 2025-05-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern scientific discovery increasingly relies on high-performance computing for complex modeling and simulation. A key challenge in improving parallel program performance is efficiently mapping tasks to processors and data to memory, a process dictated by intricate, low-level system code known as mappers. Developing high-performance mappers demands days of manual tuning, posing a significant barrier for domain scientists without systems expertise. We introduce a framework that automates mapper development with generative optimization, leveraging richer feedback beyond scalar performance metrics. Our approach features the Agent-System Interface, which includes a Domain-Specific Language (DSL) to abstract away the low-level complexity of system code and define a structured search space, as well as AutoGuide, a mechanism that interprets raw execution output into actionable feedback. Unlike traditional reinforcement learning methods such as OpenTuner, which rely solely on scalar feedback, our method finds superior mappers in far fewer iterations. With just 10 iterations, it outperforms OpenTuner even after 1000 iterations, achieving 3.8X faster performance. Our approach finds mappers that surpass expert-written mappers by up to 1.34X speedup across nine benchmarks while reducing tuning time from days to minutes.</p></details> |  |

This paper evaluates the capabilities of the Llama 2-70B model in automating these tasks for scientific applications written in commonly used programming languages. Using representative test problems, we assess the model's capacity to generate code, documentation, and unit tests, as well as its ability to translate existing code between commonly used programming languages. Our comprehensive analysis evaluates the compilation, runtime behavior, and correctness of the generated and translated code. Additionally, we assess the quality of automatically generated code, documentation and unit tests. Our results indicate that while Llama 2-70B frequently generates syntactically correct and functional code for simpler numerical tasks, it encounters substantial difficulties with more complex, parallelized, or distributed computations, requiring considerable manual corrections. We identify key limitations and suggest areas for future improvements to better leverage AI-driven automation in scientific computing workflows.</p></details> |  |

A Comprehensive Evaluation of LLMs on Formal Specification Inference](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.04779v4)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to automate programming tasks. Yet, LLMs' capabilities in reasoning about program semantics are still inadequately studied, leaving significant potential for further exploration. This paper introduces FormalBench, a comprehensive benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs' reasoning abilities on program semantics, particularly via the task of synthesizing formal program specifications to assist verifying program correctness. This task requires both comprehensive reasoning over all possible program executions and the generation of precise, syntactically correct expressions that adhere to formal syntax and semantics. Using this benchmark, we evaluated the ability of LLMs in synthesizing consistent and complete specifications. Our findings show that LLMs perform well with simple control flows but struggle with more complex structures, especially loops, even with advanced prompting. Additionally, LLMs exhibit limited robustness against semantic-preserving transformations. We also highlight common failure patterns and design self-repair prompts, improving success rates by 25%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ACL 2025 (Main Conference)</p></details> |
| **[Integer Programming for Generalized Causal Bootstrap Designs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.21464v3)** | 2025-05-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In experimental causal inference, we distinguish between two sources of uncertainty: design uncertainty, due to the treatment assignment mechanism, and sampling uncertainty, when the sample is drawn from a super-population. This distinction matters in settings with small fixed samples and heterogeneous treatment effects, as in geographical experiments. The standard bootstrap procedure most often used by practitioners primarily estimates sampling uncertainty, and the causal bootstrap procedure, which accounts for design uncertainty, was developed for the completely randomized design and the difference-in-means estimator, whereas non-standard designs and estimators are often used in these low-power regimes. We address this gap by proposing an integer program which computes numerically the worst-case copula used as an input to the causal bootstrap method, in a wide range of settings. Specifically, we prove the asymptotic validity of our approach for unconfounded, conditionally unconfounded, and and individualistic with bounded confoundedness assignments, as well as generalizing to any linear-in-treatment and quadratic-in-treatment estimators. We demonstrate the refined confidence intervals achieved through simulations of small geographical experiments.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ICML 2025</p></details> |
| **[Training Language Models to Generate Quality Code with Program Analysis Feedback](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22704v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code generation with large language models (LLMs), often termed vibe coding, is increasingly adopted in production but fails to ensure code quality, particularly in security (e.g., SQL injection vulnerabilities) and maintainability (e.g., missing type annotations). Existing methods, such as supervised fine-tuning and rule-based post-processing, rely on labor-intensive annotations or brittle heuristics, limiting their scalability and effectiveness. We propose REAL, a reinforcement learning framework that incentivizes LLMs to generate production-quality code using program analysis-guided feedback. Specifically, REAL integrates two automated signals: (1) program analysis detecting security or maintainability defects and (2) unit tests ensuring functional correctness. Unlike prior work, our framework is prompt-agnostic and reference-free, enabling scalable supervision without manual intervention. Experiments across multiple datasets and model scales demonstrate that REAL outperforms state-of-the-art methods in simultaneous assessments of functionality and code quality. Our work bridges the gap between rapid prototyping and production-ready code, enabling LLMs to deliver both speed and quality.</p></details> | 10 pages, 3 figures |

In practical design workflows, designers often engage in time-consuming reviews and refinements of these prototypes by comparing them with reference images. To bridge this gap, we introduce the CAD review task to automatically detect and correct potential errors, ensuring consistency between the constructed 3D objects and reference images. However, recent advanced multimodal large language models (MLLMs) struggle to recognize multiple geometric components and perform spatial geometric operations within the CAD program, leading to inaccurate reviews. In this paper, we propose the CAD program repairer (ReCAD) framework to effectively detect program errors and provide helpful feedback on error correction. Additionally, we create a dataset, CADReview, consisting of over 20K program-image pairs, with diverse errors for the CAD review task. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ReCAD significantly outperforms existing MLLMs, which shows great potential in design applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>ACL 2...</summary><p>ACL 2025 main conference</p></details> |
| **[(Near)-Optimal Algorithms for Sparse Separable Convex Integer Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.22212v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the general integer programming (IP) problem of optimizing a separable convex function over the integer points of a polytope: $\min \{f(\mathbf{x}) \mid A\mathbf{x} = \mathbf{b}, \, \mathbf{l} \leq \mathbf{x} \leq \mathbf{u}, \, \mathbf{x} \in \mathbb{Z}^n\}$. The number of variables $n$ is a variable part of the input, and we consider the regime where the constraint matrix $A$ has small coefficients $\|A\|_\infty$ and small primal or dual treedepth $\mathrm{td}_P(A)$ or $\mathrm{td}_D(A)$, respectively. Equivalently, we consider block-structured matrices, in particular $n$-fold, tree-fold, $2$-stage and multi-stage matrices. We ask about the possibility of near-linear time algorithms in the general case of (non-linear) separable convex functions. The techniques of previous works for the linear case are inherently limited to it; in fact, no strongly-polynomial algorithm may exist due to a simple unconditional information-theoretic lower bound of $n \log \|\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{l}\|_\infty$, where $\mathbf{l}, \mathbf{u}$ are the vectors of lower and upper bounds. Our first result is that with parameters $\mathrm{td}_P(A)$ and $\|A\|_\infty$, this lower bound can be matched (up to dependency on the parameters). Second, with parameters $\mathrm{td}_D(A)$ and $\|A\|_\infty$, the situation is more involved, and we design an algorithm with time complexity $g(\mathrm{td}_D(A), \|A\|_\infty) n \log n \log \|\mathbf{u}-\mathbf{l}\|_\infty$ where $g$ is some computable function. We conjecture that a stronger lower bound is possible in this regime, and our algorithm is in fact optimal. Our algorithms combine ideas from scaling, proximity, and sensitivity of integer programs, together with a new dynamic data structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>28 pa...</summary><p>28 pages, will appear at IPCO 2025</p></details> |
| **[Symbolically Regressing Fish Biomass Spectral Data: A Linear Genetic Programming Method with Tunable Primitives](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21901v1)** | 2025-05-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning techniques play an important role in analyzing spectral data. The spectral data of fish biomass is useful in fish production, as it carries many important chemistry properties of fish meat. However, it is challenging for existing machine learning techniques to comprehensively discover hidden patterns from fish biomass spectral data since the spectral data often have a lot of noises while the training data are quite limited. To better analyze fish biomass spectral data, this paper models it as a symbolic regression problem and solves it by a linear genetic programming method with newly proposed tunable primitives. In the symbolic regression problem, linear genetic programming automatically synthesizes regression models based on the given primitives and training data. The tunable primitives further improve the approximation ability of the regression models by tuning their inherent coefficients. Our empirical results over ten fish biomass targets show that the proposed method improves the overall performance of fish biomass composition prediction. The synthesized regression models are compact and have good interpretability, which allow us to highlight useful features over the spectrum. Our further investigation also verifies the good generality of the proposed method across various spectral data treatments and other symbolic regression problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Robust Hypothesis Generation: LLM-Automated Language Bias for Inductive Logic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21486v1)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automating robust hypothesis generation in open environments is pivotal for AI cognition. We introduce a novel framework integrating a multi-agent system, powered by Large Language Models (LLMs), with Inductive Logic Programming (ILP). Our system's LLM agents autonomously define a structured symbolic vocabulary (predicates) and relational templates , i.e., \emph{language bias} directly from raw textual data. This automated symbolic grounding (the construction of the language bias), traditionally an expert-driven bottleneck for ILP, then guides the transformation of text into facts for an ILP solver, which inductively learns interpretable rules. This approach overcomes traditional ILP's reliance on predefined symbolic structures and the noise-sensitivity of pure LLM methods. Extensive experiments in diverse, challenging scenarios validate superior performance, paving a new path for automated, explainable, and verifiable hypothesis generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Can Large Language Models Understand Symbolic Graphics Programs?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.08313v4)** | 2025-05-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Against the backdrop of enthusiasm for large language models (LLMs), there is a growing need to scientifically assess their capabilities and shortcomings. This is nontrivial in part because it is difficult to find tasks which the models have not encountered during training. Utilizing symbolic graphics programs, we propose a domain well-suited to test multiple spatial-semantic reasoning skills of LLMs. Popular in computer graphics, these programs procedurally generate visual data. While LLMs exhibit impressive skills in general program synthesis and analysis, symbolic graphics programs offer a new layer of evaluation: they allow us to test an LLM's ability to answer semantic questions about the images or 3D geometries without a vision encoder. To semantically understand the symbolic programs, LLMs would need to possess the ability to "imagine" and reason how the corresponding graphics content would look with only the symbolic description of the local curvatures and strokes. We use this task to evaluate LLMs by creating a large benchmark for the semantic visual understanding of symbolic graphics programs, built procedurally with minimal human effort. Particular emphasis is placed on transformations of images that leave the image level semantics invariant while introducing significant changes to the underlying program. We evaluate commercial and open-source LLMs on our benchmark to assess their ability to reason about visual output of programs, finding that LLMs considered stronger at reasoning generally perform better. Lastly, we introduce a novel method to improve this ability -- Symbolic Instruction Tuning (SIT), in which the LLM is finetuned with pre-collected instruction data on symbolic graphics programs. Interestingly, we find that SIT not only improves LLM's understanding on symbolic programs, but it also improves general reasoning ability on various other benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>ICLR ...</summary><p>ICLR 2025 Spotlight (v4: 47 pages, 26 figures, project page: https://sgp-bench.github.io/)</p></details> |

As the advance of AI computing, recent works explore neural network-based solvers for integer linear programming (ILP) problems. Yet, they lack scalability for tackling nonlinear challenges. To handle nonlinearities, state-of-the-art Branch-and-Cut solvers employ linear relaxations, leading to exponential growth in auxiliary variables and severe computation limitations. To overcome these limitations, we propose BIPNN (Binary Integer Programming Neural Network), an unsupervised learning framework to solve nonlinear BIP problems via hypergraph neural networks (HyperGNN). Specifically, BIPNN reformulates BIPs-constrained, discrete, and nonlinear (sin, log, exp) optimization problems-into unconstrained, differentiable, and polynomial loss functions. The reformulation stems from the observation of a precise one-to-one mapping between polynomial BIP objectives and hypergraph structures, enabling the unsupervised training of HyperGNN to optimize BIP problems in an end-to-end manner. On this basis, we propose a GPU-accelerated and continuous-annealing-enhanced training pipeline for BIPNN. The pipeline enables BIPNN to optimize large-scale nonlinear terms in BIPs fully in parallel via straightforward gradient descent, thus significantly reducing the training cost while ensuring the generation of discrete, high-quality solutions. Extensive experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets highlight the superiority of our approach.</p></details> |  |

The guard specifies the condition for entering an atomic region. That is a convenient model for the specification and verification of concurrent programs, but has eschewed efficient execution so far. This article shows how guarded atomic actions, when attached to objects, can be implemented highly efficiently using a combination of coroutines, operating-system worker threads, and dedicated management of object queues and stacks. The efficiency of an experimental language, Lime, is shown to compare favourably with that of C/Pthreads, Go, Erlang, Java, and Haskell on synthetic benchmarks.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings PLACES 2025, arXiv:2505.19078</p></details> |

The design of CLASS and the strong static guarantees of its type system originates in its Linear Logic and proposition-as-types foundations. However, instead of focusing on its theoretical foundations, this paper briefly illustrates, in a tutorial form, an identifiable CLASS session-based programming style where strong correctness properties are automatically ensured by type-checking. Our more challenging examples include concurrent thread and memory-safe mutable ADTs, lazy stream programming, and manipulation of linear digital assets as used in smart contracts.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings PLACES 2025, arXiv:2505.19078</p></details> |

However, LLMs often fail to effectively self-verify and generate correct feedback, further misleading refinement and leading to the failure of self-correction, especially in complex reasoning tasks. In this paper, we propose Program-driven Self-Correction (ProgCo). First, program-driven verification (ProgVe) achieves complex verification logic and extensive validation through self-generated, self-executing verification pseudo-programs. Then, program-driven refinement (ProgRe) receives feedback from ProgVe, conducts dual reflection and refinement on both responses and verification programs to mitigate misleading of incorrect feedback in complex reasoning tasks. Experiments on three instruction-following and mathematical benchmarks indicate that ProgCo achieves effective self-correction, and can be further enhance performance when combined with real program tools.

However, the lack of sufficient and high-quality programming data, combined with the mismatch between offline evaluation and real-world learning, hinders the practical deployment of such systems. To address this challenge, many approaches attempt to simulate learner practice data, yet they often overlook the fine-grained, iterative nature of programming learning, resulting in a lack of interpretability and granularity. To fill this gap, we propose a LLM-based agent, CoderAgent, to simulate students' programming processes in a fine-grained manner without relying on real data. Specifically, we equip each human learner with an intelligent agent, the core of which lies in capturing the cognitive states of the human programming practice process. Inspired by ACT-R, a cognitive architecture framework, we design the structure of CoderAgent to align with human cognitive architecture by focusing on the mastery of programming knowledge and the application of coding ability. Recognizing the inherent patterns in multi-layered cognitive reasoning, we introduce the Programming Tree of Thought (PTOT), which breaks down the process into four steps: why, how, where, and what. This approach enables a detailed analysis of iterative problem-solving strategies. Finally, experimental evaluations on real-world datasets demonstrate that CoderAgent provides interpretable insights into learning trajectories and achieves accurate simulations, paving the way for personalized programming education.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by IJCAI2025</p></details> |

Our method alternates between feature selection and clustering, without requiring precise estimation of sparse model parameters. Feature selection is performed by thresholding a rough estimate of the discriminative direction, while clustering is carried out via a semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation of K-means. In the isotropic case, the algorithm is motivated by the minimax separation bound for exact recovery of cluster labels using varying sparse subsets of features. This bound highlights the critical role of variable selection in achieving exact recovery. We further extend the algorithm to settings with unknown sparse precision matrices, avoiding full model parameter estimation by computing only the minimally required quantities. Across a range of simulation settings, we find that the proposed iterative approach outperforms several state-of-the-art methods, especially in higher dimensions.</p></details> | <details><summary>107 p...</summary><p>107 pages, 4 figures, 3 tables, 6 algorithms; Main text 21 pages, 2 figures, 1 table, 3 algorithms</p></details> |

Recently, large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated powerful mathematical capabilities, and the Chain-of-Thought technique, which guides LLMs through step-by-step reasoning, has yielded impressive results. However, this reasoning ability is limited by the computational weaknesses of LLMs themselves, where calculation errors can accumulate, leading to incorrect final answers. To address this, we propose Program of Equations Thoughts (POET), which transforms the task of generating step-by-step reasoning answers into a two-stage task of predicting equations and generating code, offloading complex computations to a Python interpreter to avoid calculation errors in LLMs. Furthermore, we propose Zero-shot POET, which utilizes a manually designed template to enable LLMs to directly generate Python code for one-step solving. Our method achieves accuracies of 95.3% and 98.0% on the PEN and ALG514 datasets, respectively, setting a new state-of-the-art (SOTA). Zero-shot POET also achieves the SOTA result of 95.5% on the DRAW-1K dataset.</p></details> |  |

This work presents a computational methodology for searching for pathways in reaction networks which is based on integer linear programming and the modeling of reaction networks by directed hypergraphs. Often multiple pathways fit the given search criteria. To rank them, we develop an objective function based on physical arguments maximizing the probability of the pathway. We furthermore develop an automated pipeline to estimate the energy barriers of individual reactions in reaction networks. Combined, the methodology facilitates flexible and kinetically informed pathway investigations on large reaction networks by computational means, even for networks coming without kinetic annotation, such as those created via generative approaches for expanding molecular spaces.</p></details> | 29 pages |

We propose a low-cost visual program distillation method that can be used for models with at most 1 billion parameters and requires no human-generated program annotations. We achieve this through synthetic data augmentation based on decoupling programs into higher-level skills, called templates, and their corresponding arguments.

Denote $n$ and $w$ as the length and the width of a ROBP. We have the following results. For standard ROBPs, there exists an explicit $\varepsilon$-WPRG with seed length $$ O\left(\frac{\log n\log (nw)}{\max\left\{1,\log\log w-\log\log n\right\}}+\log w \left(\log\log\log w-\log\log\max\left\{2,\frac{\log w}{\log n/\varepsilon}\right\}\right)+\log(1/\varepsilon)\right).$$ When $n = w^{o(1)},$ this is better than the constructions in Hoza (RANDOM 2022), Cohen, Doron, Renard, Sberlo, and Ta-Shma (CCC 2021).Further, by using this result in a black-box way, we attain a WPRG for regular ROBPs with seed length $$O\left(\log n\left(\sqrt{\log(1/\varepsilon)}+\log w+\log\log n\right)+\log(1/\varepsilon)\right).$$ This slightly improves the result of Chen, Hoza, Lyu, Tal, and Wu (FOCS 2023) and matches the recent simultaneous and independent work of Chen and Ta-shma. For permutation ROBPs with unbounded widths and single accept nodes, there exists an explicit $\varepsilon$-WPRG with seed length $$ O\left( \log n\left( \log\log n + \sqrt{\log(1/\varepsilon)} \right)+\log(1/\varepsilon)\right). $$ This slightly improves the result of Chen, Hoza, Lyu, Tal, and Wu (FOCS 2023). For regular ROBPs with $n \leq 2^{O(\sqrt{\log w})}, \varepsilon = 1/\text{poly} w$, we give a derandomization within space $O(\log w)$, i.e. in $\mathbf{L}$ exactly. This is better than previous results of Ahmadinejad, Kelner, Murtagh, Peebles, Sidford, and Vadhan (FOCS 2020) in this regime, and we improves the time complexity from super-polynomial to standard polynomial. Our main method is based on a recursive application of weighted pseudorandom reductions, which is a natural notion that is used to simplify ROBPs.</p></details> |  |

However, the complexity of modern bugs often makes precise root cause analysis difficult and unreliable. To address this challenge, we propose crash-site repair to simplify the repair task while still mitigating the risk of exploitation. In addition, we introduce a template-guided patch generation approach that significantly reduces the token cost of Large Language Models (LLMs) while maintaining both efficiency and effectiveness. We implement our prototype system, WILLIAMT, and evaluate it against state-of-the-art APR tools. Our results show that, when combined with the top-performing agent CodeRover-S, WILLIAMT reduces token cost by 45.9% and increases the bug-fixing rate to 73.5% (+29.6%) on ARVO, a ground-truth open source software vulnerabilities benchmark. Furthermore, we demonstrate that WILLIAMT can function effectively even without access to frontier LLMs: even a local model running on a Mac M4 Mini achieves a reasonable repair rate. These findings highlight the broad applicability and scalability of WILLIAMT.</p></details> |  |

The development of high-performance QML models requires expert-level expertise, presenting a key challenge to the widespread adoption of QML. Critical obstacles include the design of effective data encoding strategies and parameterized quantum circuits, both of which are vital for the performance of QML models. Furthermore, the measurement process is often neglected-most existing QML models employ predefined measurement schemes that may not align with the specific requirements of the targeted problem. We propose an innovative framework that renders the observable of a quantum system-specifically, the Hermitian matrix-trainable. This approach employs an end-to-end differentiable learning framework, enabling simultaneous optimization of the neural network used to program the parameterized observables and the standard quantum circuit parameters. Notably, the quantum observable parameters are dynamically programmed by the neural network, allowing the observables to adapt in real time based on the input data stream. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the proposed method effectively programs observables dynamically within variational quantum circuits, achieving superior results compared to existing approaches. Notably, it delivers enhanced performance metrics, such as higher classification accuracy, thereby significantly improving the overall effectiveness of QML models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Chemical classification program synthesis using generative artificial intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.18470v1)** | 2025-05-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurately classifying chemical structures is essential for cheminformatics and bioinformatics, including tasks such as identifying bioactive compounds of interest, screening molecules for toxicity to humans, finding non-organic compounds with desirable material properties, or organizing large chemical libraries for drug discovery or environmental monitoring. However, manual classification is labor-intensive and difficult to scale to large chemical databases. Existing automated approaches either rely on manually constructed classification rules, or the use of deep learning methods that lack explainability. This work presents an approach that uses generative artificial intelligence to automatically write chemical classifier programs for classes in the Chemical Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) database. These programs can be used for efficient deterministic run-time classification of SMILES structures, with natural language explanations. The programs themselves constitute an explainable computable ontological model of chemical class nomenclature, which we call the ChEBI Chemical Class Program Ontology (C3PO). We validated our approach against the ChEBI database, and compared our results against state of the art deep learning models. We also demonstrate the use of C3PO to classify out-of-distribution examples taken from metabolomics repositories and natural product databases. We also demonstrate the potential use of our approach to find systematic classification errors in existing chemical databases, and show how an ensemble artificial intelligence approach combining generated ontologies, automated literature search, and multimodal vision models can be used to pinpoint potential errors requiring expert validation</p></details> |  |

To further enhance this accessibility, recent research has focused on generating VPL code from user instructions using large language models (LLMs). Specifically, by employing prompting-based methods, these studies have shown promising results. Nevertheless, such approaches can be less effective for industrial VPLs such as Ladder Diagram (LD). LD is a pivotal language used in industrial automation processes and involves extensive domain-specific configurations, which are difficult to capture in a single prompt. In this work, we demonstrate that training-based methods outperform prompting-based methods for LD generation accuracy, even with smaller backbone models. Building on these findings, we propose a two-stage training strategy to further enhance VPL generation. First, we employ retrieval-augmented fine-tuning to leverage the repetitive use of subroutines commonly seen in industrial VPLs. Second, we apply direct preference optimization (DPO) to further guide the model toward accurate outputs, using systematically generated preference pairs through graph editing operations. Extensive experiments on real-world LD data demonstrate that our approach improves program-level accuracy by over 10% compared to supervised fine-tuning, which highlights its potential to advance industrial automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at ACL 2025 (Main, long paper)</p></details> |
| **[Gradient-Based Program Repair: Fixing Bugs in Continuous Program Spaces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.17703v1)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automatic program repair seeks to generate correct code from buggy programs, with most approaches searching the correct program in a discrete, symbolic space of source code tokens. This symbolic search is fundamentally limited by its inability to directly reason about program behavior. We introduce Gradient-Based Program Repair (GBPR), a new paradigm that reframes program repair as continuous optimization in a differentiable numerical program space. Our core insight is to compile symbolic programs into differentiable numerical representations, enabling search in the numerical program space directly guided by program behavior. To evaluate GBPR, we present RaspBugs, a new benchmark of 1,466 buggy symbolic RASP programs and their respective numerical representations. Our experiments demonstrate that GBPR can effectively repair buggy symbolic programs by gradient-based optimization in the numerical program space, with convincing repair trajectories. To our knowledge, we are the first to state program repair as continuous optimization in a numerical program space. Our work establishes a new direction for program repair research, bridging two rich worlds: continuous optimization and program behavior.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we address this gap by formalizing the Program-to-Geometry task, which challenges models to translate programmatic drawing code into accurate and abstract geometric reasoning. To evaluate this capability, we present GeoGramBench, a benchmark of 500 carefully refined problems organized by a tailored three-level taxonomy that considers geometric complexity rather than traditional mathematical reasoning complexity. Our comprehensive evaluation of 17 frontier LLMs reveals consistent and pronounced deficiencies: even the most advanced models achieve less than 50% accuracy at the highest abstraction level. These results highlight the unique challenges posed by program-driven spatial reasoning and establish GeoGramBench as a valuable resource for advancing research in symbolic-to-spatial geometric reasoning.

However, the training of TAL models requires a substantial amount of manually annotated data. Data programming is an efficient method to create training labels with a series of human-defined labeling functions. However, its application in TAL faces difficulties of defining complex actions in the context of temporal video frames. In this paper, we propose ProTAL, a drag-and-link video programming framework for TAL. ProTAL enables users to define \textbf{key events} by dragging nodes representing body parts and objects and linking them to constrain the relations (direction, distance, etc.). These definitions are used to generate action labels for large-scale unlabelled videos. A semi-supervised method is then employed to train TAL models with such labels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of ProTAL through a usage scenario and a user study, providing insights into designing video programming framework.</p></details> | Accepted at CHI'25 |
| **[Planning-Driven Programming: A Large Language Model Programming Workflow](http://arxiv.org/abs/2411.14503v3)** | 2025-05-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The strong performance of large language models (LLMs) raises extensive discussion on their application to code generation. Recent research suggests continuous program refinements through visible tests to improve code generation accuracy in LLMs. However, these methods suffer from LLMs' inefficiency and limited reasoning capacity. In this work, we propose an LLM programming workflow (LPW) designed to improve both initial code generation and subsequent refinements within a structured two-phase workflow. Specifically, the solution generation phase formulates a solution plan, which is then verified through visible tests to specify the intended natural language solution. Subsequently, the code implementation phase drafts an initial code according to the solution plan and its verification. If the generated code fails the visible tests, the plan verification serves as the intended solution to consistently inform the refinement process for correcting bugs. Compared to state-of-the-art methods across various existing LLMs, LPW significantly improves the Pass@1 accuracy by up to 16.4% on well-established text-to-code generation benchmarks. LPW also sets new state-of-the-art Pass@1 accuracy, achieving 98.2% on HumanEval, 84.8% on MBPP, 59.3% on LiveCode, 62.6% on APPS, and 34.7% on CodeContest, using GPT-4o as the backbone.

Internally, {log} is a constraint satisfiability solver implementing decision procedures for several fragments of set theory. Hence, {log} can be used as a declarative, set, logic programming language and as an automated theorem prover for set theory. Over time {log} has been extended with some components integrated to the satisfiability solver thus providing a formal verification environment. In this paper we make a comprehensive presentation of this environment which includes a language for the description of state machines based on set theory, an interactive environment for the execution of functional scenarios over state machines, a generator of verification conditions for state machines, automated verification of state machines, and test case generation. State machines are both, programs and specifications; exactly the same code works as a program and as its specification. In this way, with a few additions, a CLP language turned into a seamlessly integrated programming and automated proof system.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to Theory and Practice of Logic Programming</p></details> |

While Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting improves reasoning, it struggles with non-English languages due to the entanglement of reasoning and execution. Program-of-Thought (PoT) prompting separates reasoning from execution, offering a promising alternative but shifting the challenge to generating programs from non-English questions. We propose a framework to evaluate PoT by separating multilingual reasoning from code execution to examine (i) the impact of fine-tuning on question-reasoning alignment and (ii) how reasoning quality affects answer correctness. Our findings demonstrate that PoT fine-tuning substantially enhances multilingual reasoning, outperforming CoT fine-tuned models. We further demonstrate a strong correlation between reasoning quality (measured through code quality) and answer accuracy, highlighting its potential as a test-time performance improvement heuristic.</p></details> |  |

In this setting, the objective function associated with the optimization problem is a summation of a set of functions, each held by one node in a network. The semi-infinite constraint, on the other hand, is known to all agents. The nodes collectively aim to solve the problem using local data about the objective and limited communication capabilities depending on the network topology. Our algorithm is built on three key ingredients: consensus step, gradient descent in the local objective, and local gradient descent iterations in the constraint at a node when the estimate violates the semi-infinite constraint. The algorithm is constructed, and its parameters are prescribed in such a way that the iterates held by each agent provably converge to an optimizer. That is, as the algorithm progresses, the estimates achieve consensus, and the constraint violation and the error in the optimal value are bounded above by vanishing terms. Simulation examples illustrate our results.</p></details> | 16 pages, 1 figure |

Although the new front-end has demonstrated significant potential in previous studies, it remains in the developmental stage and lacks several essential features. ESBMC v7.6 further enhanced this foundation by adding and extending features based on the Clang AST, such as 1) exception handling, 2) extended memory management and memory safety verification, including dangling pointers, duplicate deallocation, memory leaks and rvalue references and 3) new operational models for STL updating the outdated C++ operational models. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that ESBMC v7.6 can handle a significantly broader range of C++ features introduced in recent versions of the C++ standard.</p></details> | <details><summary>27 pa...</summary><p>27 pages, 2 figures. arXiv admin note: substantial text overlap with arXiv:2308.05649</p></details> |

We argue that successfully deploying AI software engineers requires a level of trust equal to or even greater than the trust established by human-driven software engineering practices. The recent trend toward LLM agents offers a path toward integrating the power of LLMs to create new code with the power of analysis tools to increase trust in the code. This opinion piece comments on whether LLM agents could dominate software engineering workflows in the future and whether the focus of programming will shift from programming at scale to programming with trust.</p></details> | 5 pages |

While large language models (LLMs) have recently shown impressive capabilities in a variety of tasks, they continue to struggle with complex puzzles that demand precise reasoning and exhaustive search. In this paper, we propose Logic-of-Thought (Logot), a novel framework that bridges LLMs with logic programming to address this problem. Our method leverages LLMs to translate puzzle rules and states into answer set programs (ASPs), the solution of which are then accurately and efficiently inferred by an ASP interpreter. This hybrid approach combines the natural language understanding of LLMs with the precise reasoning capabilities of logic programs. We evaluate our method on various grid puzzles and dynamic puzzles involving actions, demonstrating near-perfect accuracy across all tasks.

The intuition behind this is that the programming languages (PLs) inherently exhibit greater structural organization than natural languages (NLs). This structural advantage makes PLs particularly suited for IE tasks. Nevertheless, existing research primarily focuses on Python for code-style simulation, overlooking the potential of other widely-used PLs (e.g., C++ and Java) during the supervised fine-tuning (SFT) phase. In this research, we propose \textbf{M}ultiple \textbf{P}rogramming \textbf{L}anguages with large language models for information extraction (abbreviated as \textbf{MPL}), a novel framework that explores the potential of incorporating different PLs in the SFT phase. Additionally, we introduce \texttt{function-prompt} with virtual running to simulate code-style inputs more effectively and efficiently. Experimental results on a wide range of datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of MPL. Furthermore, we conduct extensive experiments to provide a comprehensive analysis. We have released our code for future research.</p></details> | Findings of ACL2025 |

We investigate whether synthetic data generation can help identify at-risk students earlier in a small, imbalanced dataset from an introductory programming module. The analysis used anonymised records from 379 students, with 15\% marked as failing, and applied several machine learning algorithms. The first experiments showed poor recall for the failing group. However, using synthetic data generation methods led to a significant improvement in performance. Our results suggest that machine learning can help identify at-risk students early in programming courses when combined with synthetic data. This research lays the groundwork for validating and using these models with live student cohorts in the future, to allow for timely and effective interventions that can improve student outcomes. It also includes feature importance analysis to refine formative tasks. Overall, this study contributes to developing practical workflows that help detect disengagement early and improve student success in programming education.</p></details> | <details><summary>To be...</summary><p>To be published in the Doctoral Consortium Track at AIED 2025, (Pre-Print)</p></details> |

We propose a new algorithmic method for synthesizing loop invariants and procedure pre/post-conditions represented as universally quantified first-order formulas constraining the array elements and program variables. We adopt a data-driven approach that extends the decision tree Horn-ICE framework to handle arrays. We provide a powerful learning technique based on reducing a complex classification problem of vectors of integer arrays to a simpler classification problem of vectors of integers. The obtained classifier is generalized to get universally quantified invariants and procedure pre/post-conditions. We have implemented our method and shown its efficiency and competitiveness w.r.t. state-of-the-art tools on a significant benchmark.</p></details> |  |

Specifications consist of stream equations, which relate input streams, containing sensor readings and other incoming information, to output streams, representing filtered and aggregated data. This paper presents a framework for the stream-based specification language RTLola. We introduce a new intermediate representation for stream-based languages, the StreamIR, which, like the specification language, operates on streams of unbounded length; while the stream equations are replaced by imperative programs. We developed a set of optimizations based on static analysis of the specification and have implemented an interpreter and a compiler for several target languages. In our evaluation, we measure the performance of several real-world case studies. The results show that using the StreamIR framework reduces the runtime significantly compared to the existing StreamIR interpreter. We evaluate the effect of the optimizations and show that significant performance gains are possible beyond the optimizations of the target language's compiler. While our current implementation is limited to RTLola, the StreamIR is designed to accommodate other stream-based languages, enabling their interpretation and compilation into all available target languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Let's Take Esoteric Programming Languages Seriously](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15327v1)** | 2025-05-21 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Esoteric programming languages are challenging to learn, but their unusual features and constraints may serve to improve programming ability. From languages designed to be intentionally obtuse (e.g. INTERCAL) to others targeting artistic expression (e.g. Piet) or exploring the nature of computation (e.g. Fractan), there is rich variety in the realm of esoteric programming languages. This essay examines the counterintuitive appeal of esoteric languages and seeks to analyse reasons for this popularity. We will explore why people are attracted to esoteric languages in terms of (a) program comprehension and construction, as well as (b) language design and implementation. Our assertion is that esoteric languages can improve general PL awareness, at the same time as enabling the esoteric programmer to impress their peers with obscure knowledge. We will also consider pedagogic principles and the use of AI, in relation to esoteric languages. Emerging from the specific discussion, we identify a general set of 'good' reasons for designing new programming languages. It may not be possible to be exhaustive on this topic, and it is certain we have not achieved that goal here. However we believe our most important contribution is to draw attention to the varied and often implicit motivations involved in programming language design.</p></details> | 13 pages, 7 figures |

However, existing ATCG methods often fail to meet complex specifications or generate effective corner cases, limiting their utility. In this work, we introduce Context-Free Grammars with Counters (CCFGs), a formalism that captures both syntactic and semantic structures in input specifications. Using a fine-tuned CodeT5 model, we translate natural language input specifications into CCFGs, enabling the systematic generation of high-quality test cases. Experiments on the CodeContests dataset demonstrate that CCFG-based test cases outperform baseline methods in identifying incorrect algorithms, achieving significant gains in validity and effectiveness. Our approach provides a scalable and reliable grammar-driven framework for enhancing automated competitive programming evaluations.</p></details> |  |

We introduce EquiBench, a new benchmark for evaluating LLMs through equivalence checking, i.e., determining whether two programs produce identical outputs for all possible inputs. Unlike prior code generation benchmarks, this task directly tests a model's understanding of code execution semantics. EquiBench consists of 2400 program pairs across four languages and six categories. These pairs are generated through program analysis, compiler scheduling, and superoptimization, ensuring high-confidence labels, nontrivial difficulty, and full automation. The transformations span syntactic edits, structural modifications, and algorithmic changes, covering a broad spectrum of semantic variation. We evaluate 19 state-of-the-art LLMs and find that in the most challenging categories, the best accuracies are 63.8% and 76.2%, only modestly above the 50% random baseline. Further analysis reveals that models often rely on syntactic similarity rather than exhibiting robust reasoning over execution semantics, highlighting fundamental limitations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Cassandra: Efficient Enforcement of Sequential Execution for Cryptographic Programs (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.04290v2)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constant-time programming is a widely deployed approach to harden cryptographic programs against side channel attacks. However, modern processors often violate the underlying assumptions of standard constant-time policies by transiently executing unintended paths of the program. Despite many solutions proposed, addressing control flow misspeculations in an efficient way without losing performance is an open problem. In this work, we propose Cassandra, a novel hardware/software mechanism to enforce sequential execution for constant-time cryptographic code in a highly efficient manner. Cassandra explores the radical design point of disabling the branch predictor and recording-and-replaying sequential control flow of the program. Two key insights that enable our design are that (1) the sequential control flow of a constant-time program is mostly static over different runs, and (2) cryptographic programs are loop-intensive and their control flow patterns repeat in a highly compressible way. These insights allow us to perform an upfront branch analysis that significantly compresses control flow traces. We add a small component to a typical processor design, the Branch Trace Unit, to store compressed traces and determine fetch redirections according to the sequential model of the program. Despite providing a strong security guarantee, Cassandra counterintuitively provides an average 1.85% speedup compared to an unsafe baseline processor, mainly due to enforcing near-perfect fetch redirections.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 9 figures, 4 tables, 1 listing</p></details> |

This paper introduces a unified, foundational approach to verifying such programs. Central to our approach is the knitted-tree encoding, modeling each program execution as a tree structure capturing input, output, and intermediate states. Leveraging the compositional nature of knitted-trees, we encode these structures as constrained Horn clauses (CHCs), reducing verification to CHC satisfiability task. To illustrate our approach, we focus on memory safety and show how it naturally leads to simple, modular invariants.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transductively Informed Inductive Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.14744v1)** | 2025-05-20 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Abstraction and reasoning in program synthesis has seen significant progress through both inductive and transductive paradigms. Inductive approaches generate a program or latent function from input-output examples, which can then be applied to new inputs. Transductive approaches directly predict output values for given inputs, effectively serving as the function themselves. Current approaches combine inductive and transductive models via isolated ensembling, but they do not explicitly model the interaction between both paradigms. In this work, we introduce \acs{tiips}, a novel framework that unifies transductive and inductive strategies by explicitly modeling their interactions through a cooperative mechanism: an inductive model generates programs, while a transductive model constrains, guides, and refines the search to improve synthesis accuracy and generalization. We evaluate \acs{tiips} on two widely studied program synthesis domains: string and list manipulation. Our results show that \acs{tiips} solves more tasks and yields functions that more closely match optimal solutions in syntax and semantics, particularly in out-of-distribution settings, yielding state-of-the-art performance. We believe that explicitly modeling the synergy between inductive and transductive reasoning opens promising avenues for general-purpose program synthesis and broader applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adversarial Reasoning for Repair Based on Inferred Program Intent](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.13008v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has shown promising results, particularly with the use of neural networks. Currently, most APR tools focus on code transformations specified by test suites, rather than reasoning about the program intent and the high-level bug specification. Without a proper understanding of program intent, these tools tend to generate patches that overfit incomplete test suites and fail to reflect the developers intentions. However, reasoning about program intent is challenging. In our work, we propose an approach called AdverIntent-Agent, based on critique and adversarial reasoning. Our approach is novel to shift the focus from generating multiple APR patches to inferring multiple potential program intents. Ideally, we aim to infer intents that are, to some extent, adversarial to each other, maximizing the probability that at least one aligns closely with the developers original intent. AdverIntent-Agent is a multi-agent approach consisting of three agents: a reasoning agent, a test agent, and a repair agent. First, the reasoning agent generates adversarial program intents along with the corresponding faulty statements. Next, the test agent produces adversarial test cases that align with each inferred intent, constructing oracles that use the same inputs but have different expected outputs. Finally, the repair agent uses dynamic and precise LLM prompts to generate patches that satisfy both the inferred program intent and the generated tests. AdverIntent-Agent was evaluated on two benchmarks: Defects4J 2.0 and HumanEval-Java. AdverIntent-Agent correctly repaired 77 and 105 bugs in both benchmarks, respectively.</p></details> |  |

However, the growing presence of duplicate or highly similar problems raises concerns not only about competition fairness, but also about the validity of competitive programming as a benchmark for model evaluation. In this paper, we propose a new problem -- similar question retrieval -- to address this issue. Due to the lack of both data and models, solving this problem is challenging. To this end, we introduce CPRet, a retrieval-oriented benchmark suite for competitive programming, covering four retrieval tasks: two code-centric (i.e., Text-to-Code and Code-to-Code) and two newly proposed problem-centric tasks (i.e., Problem-to-Duplicate and Simplified-to-Full), built from a combination of automatically crawled problem-solution data and manually curated annotations. Our contribution includes both high-quality training data and temporally separated test sets for reliable evaluation. In addition, we develop two task-specialized retrievers based on this dataset: CPRetriever-Code, trained with a novel Group-InfoNCE loss for problem-code alignment, and CPRetriever-Prob, fine-tuned for identifying problem-level similarity. Both models achieve strong results and are open-sourced for local use. Finally, we analyze LiveCodeBench and find that high-similarity problems inflate model pass rates and reduce differentiation, underscoring the need for similarity-aware evaluation in future benchmarks.

Despite the intelligence shown by the large language models, their specificity in code generation can still be improved due to the syntactic gap and mismatched vocabulary existing between natural language and programming languages. In this paper, we propose CodeGRAG, a Graphical Retrieval Augmented Code Generation framework that bridges the gap between NL and PL to enhance the performance of LLMs. CodeGRAG builds the graphical view of code blocks based on the control flow and data flow of them to better interpret the programming domain knowledge, which can facilitate natural language based LLMs for better understanding of code syntax and serve as a bridge among different programming languages. To take the extracted structural knowledge into the foundation models, we propose 1) a hard meta-graph prompt template to transform the challenging syntax graph into informative graphical view for tuning-free models and 2) a soft prompting technique that injects the domain knowledge of programming languages into model parameters via finetuning the models with the soft signals encoded by GNN expert model. Specifically, two constraints are designed to improve the alignment and structure expressiveness, contributing to the informativeness of the single-token-sized external <GraphEmb> for enhanced code generation.

| **[On-Policy Optimization with Group Equivalent Preference for Multi-Programming Language Understanding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12723v1)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance in code generation tasks. However, a significant performance disparity persists between popular programming languages (e.g., Python, C++) and others. To address this capability gap, we leverage the code translation task to train LLMs, thereby facilitating the transfer of coding proficiency across diverse programming languages. Moreover, we introduce OORL for training, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates on-policy and off-policy strategies. Within OORL, on-policy RL is applied during code translation, guided by a rule-based reward signal derived from unit tests. Complementing this coarse-grained rule-based reward, we propose Group Equivalent Preference Optimization (GEPO), a novel preference optimization method. Specifically, GEPO trains the LLM using intermediate representations (IRs) groups. LLMs can be guided to discern IRs equivalent to the source code from inequivalent ones, while also utilizing signals about the mutual equivalence between IRs within the group. This process allows LLMs to capture nuanced aspects of code functionality. By employing OORL for training with code translation tasks, LLMs improve their recognition of code functionality and their understanding of the relationships between code implemented in different languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our OORL for LLMs training with code translation tasks achieves significant performance improvements on code benchmarks across multiple programming languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Text2VP: Generative AI for Visual Programming and Parametric Modeling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.07732v2)** | 2025-05-19 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The integration of generative artificial intelligence (AI) into architectural design has advanced significantly, enabling the generation of text, images, and 3D models. However, prior AI applications lack support for text-to-parametric models, essential for generating and optimizing diverse parametric design options. This study introduces Text-to-Visual Programming (Text2VP) GPT, a novel generative AI derived from GPT-4.1, designed to automate graph-based visual programming workflows, parameters, and their interconnections. Text2VP leverages detailed documentation, specific instructions, and example-driven few-shot learning to reflect user intentions accurately and facilitate interactive parameter adjustments. Testing demonstrates Text2VP's capability in generating functional parametric models, although higher complexity models present increased error rates. This research highlights generative AI's potential in visual programming and parametric modeling, laying groundwork for future improvements to manage complex modeling tasks. Ultimately, Text2VP aims to enable designers to easily create and modify parametric models without extensive training in specialized platforms like Grasshopper.</p></details> | <details><summary>Demon...</summary><p>Demonstration Video: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLUOmOLuLSaDWss2En2buixBxvTPy-lDvA</p></details> |
| **[Learning to Optimize for Mixed-Integer Non-linear Programming with Feasibility Guarantees](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.11061v9)** | 2025-05-18 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-integer nonlinear programs (MINLPs) arise in domains as diverse as energy systems and transportation, but are notoriously difficult to solve, particularly at scale. While learning-to-optimize (L2O) methods have been successful at continuous optimization, extending them to MINLPs is challenging due to integer constraints. To overcome this, we propose a novel L2O approach with two integer correction layers to ensure the integrality of the solution and a projection step to ensure the feasibility of the solution. We prove that the projection step converges, providing a theoretical guarantee for our method. Our experiments show that our methods efficiently solve MINLPs with up to tens of thousands of variables, providing high-quality solutions within milliseconds, even for problems where traditional solvers and heuristics fail. This is the first general L2O method for parametric MINLPs, finding solutions to some of the largest instances reported to date.</p></details> |  |
| **[Curriculum Learning in Genetic Programming Guided Local Search for Large-scale Vehicle Routing Problems](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15839v1)** | 2025-05-17 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Manually designing (meta-)heuristics for the Vehicle Routing Problem (VRP) is a challenging task that requires significant domain expertise. Recently, data-driven approaches have emerged as a promising solution, automatically learning heuristics that perform well on training instances and generalize to unseen test cases. Such an approach learns (meta-)heuristics that can perform well on the training instances, expecting it to generalize well on the unseen test instances. A recent method, named GPGLS, uses Genetic Programming (GP) to learn the utility function in Guided Local Search (GLS) and solved large scale VRP effectively. However, the selection of appropriate training instances during the learning process remains an open question, with most existing studies including GPGLS relying on random instance selection. To address this, we propose a novel method, CL-GPGLS, which integrates Curriculum Learning (CL) into GPGLS. Our approach leverages a predefined curriculum to introduce training instances progressively, starting with simpler tasks and gradually increasing complexity, enabling the model to better adapt and optimize for large-scale VRP (LSVRP). Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of CL-GPGLS, demonstrating significant performance improvements over three baseline methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Co-Evolutionary Defence of Active Directory Attack Graphs via GNN-Approximated Dynamic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11710v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern enterprise networks increasingly rely on Active Directory (AD) for identity and access management. However, this centralization exposes a single point of failure, allowing adversaries to compromise high-value assets. Existing AD defense approaches often assume static attacker behavior, but real-world adversaries adapt dynamically, rendering such methods brittle. To address this, we model attacker-defender interactions in AD as a Stackelberg game between an adaptive attacker and a proactive defender. We propose a co-evolutionary defense framework that combines Graph Neural Network Approximated Dynamic Programming (GNNDP) to model attacker strategies, with Evolutionary Diversity Optimization (EDO) to generate resilient blocking strategies. To ensure scalability, we introduce a Fixed-Parameter Tractable (FPT) graph reduction method that reduces complexity while preserving strategic structure. Our framework jointly refines attacker and defender policies to improve generalization and prevent premature convergence. Experiments on synthetic AD graphs show near-optimal results (within 0.1 percent of optimality on r500) and improved performance on larger graphs (r1000 and r2000), demonstrating the framework's scalability and effectiveness.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generalization Guarantees for Learning Branch-and-Cut Policies in Integer Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11636v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mixed-integer programming (MIP) provides a powerful framework for optimization problems, with Branch-and-Cut (B&C) being the predominant algorithm in state-of-the-art solvers. The efficiency of B&C critically depends on heuristic policies for making sequential decisions, including node selection, cut selection, and branching variable selection. While traditional solvers often employ heuristics with manually tuned parameters, recent approaches increasingly leverage machine learning, especially neural networks, to learn these policies directly from data. A key challenge is to understand the theoretical underpinnings of these learned policies, particularly their generalization performance from finite data. This paper establishes rigorous sample complexity bounds for learning B&C policies where the scoring functions guiding each decision step (node, cut, branch) have a certain piecewise polynomial structure. This structure generalizes the linear models that form the most commonly deployed policies in practice and investigated recently in a foundational series of theoretical works by Balcan et al. Such piecewise polynomial policies also cover the neural network architectures (e.g., using ReLU activations) that have been the focal point of contemporary practical studies. Consequently, our theoretical framework closely reflects the models utilized by practitioners investigating machine learning within B&C, offering a unifying perspective relevant to both established theory and modern empirical research in this area. Furthermore, our theory applies to quite general sequential decision making problems beyond B&C.</p></details> |  |
| **[Mechanically Programming the Cross-Sectional Shape of Soft Growing Robotic Structures for Patient Transfer](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.11593v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Pneumatic soft everting robotic structures have the potential to facilitate human transfer tasks due to their ability to grow underneath humans without sliding friction and their utility as a flexible sling when deflated. Tubular structures naturally yield circular cross-sections when inflated, whereas a robotic sling must be both thin enough to grow between them and their resting surface and wide enough to cradle the human. Recent works have achieved flattened cross-sections by including rigid components into the structure, but this reduces conformability to the human. We present a method of mechanically programming the cross-section of soft everting robotic structures using flexible strips that constrain radial expansion between points along the outer membrane. Our method enables simultaneously wide and thin profiles while maintaining the full multi-axis flexibility of traditional slings. We develop and validate a model relating the geometric design specifications to the fabrication parameters, and experimentally characterize their effects on growth rate. Finally, we prototype a soft growing robotic sling system and demonstrate its use for assisting a single caregiver in bed-to-chair patient transfer.</p></details> |  |
| **[From Hand-Crafted Metrics to Evolved Training-Free Performance Predictors for Neural Architecture Search via Genetic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.15832v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Estimating the network performance using zero-cost (ZC) metrics has proven both its efficiency and efficacy in Neural Architecture Search (NAS). However, a notable limitation of most ZC proxies is their inconsistency, as reflected by the substantial variation in their performance across different problems. Furthermore, the design of existing ZC metrics is manual, involving a time-consuming trial-and-error process that requires substantial domain expertise. These challenges raise two critical questions: (1) Can we automate the design of ZC metrics? and (2) Can we utilize the existing hand-crafted ZC metrics to synthesize a more generalizable one? In this study, we propose a framework based on Symbolic Regression via Genetic Programming to automate the design of ZC metrics. Our framework is not only highly extensible but also capable of quickly producing a ZC metric with a strong positive rank correlation to true network performance across diverse NAS search spaces and tasks. Extensive experiments on 13 problems from NAS-Bench-Suite-Zero demonstrate that our automatically generated proxies consistently outperform hand-crafted alternatives. Using our evolved proxy metric as the search objective in an evolutionary algorithm, we could identify network architectures with competitive performance within 15 minutes using a single consumer GPU.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Identification of Logical Errors in Programs: Advancing Scalable Analysis of Student Misconceptions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.10913v1)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In Computer Science (CS) education, understanding factors contributing to students' programming difficulties is crucial for effective learning support. By identifying specific issues students face, educators can provide targeted assistance to help them overcome obstacles and improve learning outcomes. While identifying sources of struggle, such as misconceptions, in real-time can be challenging in current educational practices, analyzing logical errors in students' code can offer valuable insights. This paper presents a scalable framework for automatically detecting logical errors in students' programming solutions. Our framework is based on an explainable Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) embedding model, the Subtree-based Attention Neural Network (SANN), that identifies the structural components of programs containing logical errors. We conducted a series of experiments to evaluate its effectiveness, and the results suggest that our framework can accurately capture students' logical errors and, more importantly, provide us with deeper insights into their learning processes, offering a valuable tool for enhancing programming education.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for publication at the 18th International Conference on Educational Data Mining (EDM), 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Curious Case of Class Accuracy Imbalance in LLMs: Post-hoc Debiasing via Nonlinear Integer Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.07623v6)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are good knowledge bases but struggle to perform equally well for all classes in text classification. This paper investigates the case of class accuracy imbalance in LLMs, where deeply entangled pretraining biases and prompt-specific cues contribute to the imbalance. To overcome the difficulty in bias identification and inaccessibility of retraining, we post-hoc balance class accuracy using only output probabilities. This is enabled by reformulating debiasing as a combinatorial optimization problem. In details, we first motivate a post-hoc bias metric, the Contextual Oddity Bias (COBias), to quantify the over-/under-prediction (a tendency to over-predict some classes while under-predicting others) in LLMs. We then propose the Debiasing as Nonlinear Integer Programming (DNIP) method to reweight LLM output class probabilities towards minimizing COBias and max12 imizing overall accuracy, without being constrained by bias sources or updating LLM parameters. Since the DNIP model contains non-differentiable elements, we use simulated annealing to efficiently solve it. Evaluations on five LLMs across NLP classification benchmarks show that DNIP simultaneously achieves signifi16 cant COBias reduction (61% relative reduction) and accuracy improvement (18% relative increase) under different LLM prompting setups.</p></details> |  |
| **[Tensor Network Structure Search with Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02711v3)** | 2025-05-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tensor networks provide a powerful framework for compressing multi-dimensional data. The optimal tensor network structure for a given data tensor depends on both data characteristics and specific optimality criteria, making tensor network structure search a difficult problem. Existing solutions typically rely on sampling and compressing numerous candidate structures; these procedures are computationally expensive and therefore limiting for practical applications. We address this challenge by viewing tensor network structure search as a program synthesis problem and introducing an efficient constraint-based assessment method that avoids costly tensor decomposition. Specifically, we establish a correspondence between transformation programs and network structures. We also design a novel operation named output-directed splits to reduce the search space without hindering expressiveness. We then propose a synthesis algorithm to identify promising network candidates through constraint solving, and avoid tensor decomposition for all but the most promising candidates. Experimental results show that our approach improves search speed by up to $10\times$ and achieves compression ratios $1.5\times$ to $3\times$ better than state-of-the-art. Notably, our approach scales to larger tensors that are unattainable by prior work. Furthermore, the discovered topologies generalize well to similar data, yielding compression ratios up to $ 2.4\times$ better than a generic structure while the runtime remains around $110$ seconds.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Current Language Models Support Code Intelligence for R Programming Language?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.07793v3)** | 2025-05-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in developing Pre-trained Language Models for Code (Code-PLMs) have urged many areas of Software Engineering (SE) and brought breakthrough results for many SE tasks. Though these models have achieved the state-of-the-art performance for SE tasks for many popular programming languages, such as Java and Python, the Scientific Software and its related languages like R programming language have rarely benefited or even been evaluated with the Code-PLMs. Research has shown that R has many differences with other programming languages and requires specific techniques. In this study, we provide the first insights for code intelligence for R. For this purpose, we collect and open source an R dataset, and evaluate Code-PLMs for the two tasks of code summarization and method name prediction using several settings and strategies, including the differences in two R styles, Tidy-verse and Base R. Our results demonstrate that the studied models have experienced varying degrees of performance degradation when processing R programming language code, which is supported by human evaluation. Additionally, not all models show performance improvement in R-specific tasks even after multi-language fine-tuning. The dual syntax paradigms in R significantly impact the models' performance, particularly in code summarization tasks. Furthermore, the project-specific context inherent in R codebases significantly impacts the performance when attempting cross-project training.</p></details> |  |
