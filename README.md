This uniform token allocation mismatches the intrinsic structure of speech, where information is distributed unevenly over time. To address this, we propose VARSTok, a VAriable-frame-Rate Speech Tokenizer that adapts token allocation based on local feature similarity. VARSTok introduces two key innovations: (1) a temporal-aware density peak clustering algorithm that adaptively segments speech into variable-length units, and (2) a novel implicit duration coding scheme that embeds both content and temporal span into a single token index, eliminating the need for auxiliary duration predictors. Extensive experiments show that VARSTok significantly outperforms strong fixed-rate baselines. Notably, it achieves superior reconstruction naturalness while using up to 23% fewer tokens than a 40 Hz fixed-frame-rate baseline. VARSTok further yields lower word error rates and improved naturalness in zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that a fully dynamic, variable-frame-rate acoustic speech tokenizer can be seamlessly integrated into downstream speech language models.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to AAAI 2026.

| **[A Style is Worth One Code: Unlocking Code-to-Style Image Generation with Discrete Style Space](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10555v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Innovative visual stylization is a cornerstone of artistic creation, yet generating novel and consistent visual styles remains a significant challenge. Existing generative approaches typically rely on lengthy textual prompts, reference images, or parameter-efficient fine-tuning to guide style-aware image generation, but often struggle with style consistency, limited creativity, and complex style representations. In this paper, we affirm that a style is worth one numerical code by introducing the novel task, code-to-style image generation, which produces images with novel, consistent visual styles conditioned solely on a numerical style code. To date, this field has only been primarily explored by the industry (e.g., Midjourney), with no open-source research from the academic community. To fill this gap, we propose CoTyle, the first open-source method for this task. Specifically, we first train a discrete style codebook from a collection of images to extract style embeddings. These embeddings serve as conditions for a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I-DM) to generate stylistic images. Subsequently, we train an autoregressive style generator on the discrete style embeddings to model their distribution, allowing the synthesis of novel style embeddings. During inference, a numerical style code is mapped to a unique style embedding by the style generator, and this embedding guides the T2I-DM to generate images in the corresponding style. Unlike existing methods, our method offers unparalleled simplicity and diversity, unlocking a vast space of reproducible styles from minimal input. Extensive experiments validate that CoTyle effectively turns a numerical code into a style controller, demonstrating a style is worth one code.</p></details> | <details><summary>16 pa...</summary><p>16 pages, 13 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |
| **[Does AI-Assisted Coding Deliver? A Difference-in-Differences Study of Cursor's Impact on Software Projects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04427v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the promise to revolutionize the field of software engineering. Among other things, LLM agents are rapidly gaining momentum in their application to software development, with practitioners claiming a multifold productivity increase after adoption. Yet, empirical evidence is lacking around these claims. In this paper, we estimate the causal effect of adopting a widely popular LLM agent assistant, namely Cursor, on development velocity and software quality. The estimation is enabled by a state-of-the-art difference-in-differences design comparing Cursor-adopting GitHub projects with a matched control group of similar GitHub projects that do not use Cursor. We find that the adoption of Cursor leads to a significant, large, but transient increase in project-level development velocity, along with a significant and persistent increase in static analysis warnings and code complexity. Further panel generalized method of moments estimation reveals that the increase in static analysis warnings and code complexity acts as a major factor causing long-term velocity slowdown. Our study carries implications for software engineering practitioners, LLM agent assistant designers, and researchers.</p></details> |  |
| **[DOTA-ME-CS: Daily Oriented Text Audio-Mandarin English-Code Switching Dataset](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12122v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code-switching, the alternation between two or more languages within communication, poses great challenges for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Existing models and datasets are limited in their ability to effectively handle these challenges. To address this gap and foster progress in code-switching ASR research, we introduce the DOTA-ME-CS: Daily oriented text audio Mandarin-English code-switching dataset, which consists of 18.54 hours of audio data, including 9,300 recordings from 34 participants. To enhance the dataset's diversity, we apply artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as AI timbre synthesis, speed variation, and noise addition, thereby increasing the complexity and scalability of the task. The dataset is carefully curated to ensure both diversity and quality, providing a robust resource for researchers addressing the intricacies of bilingual speech recognition with detailed data analysis. We further demonstrate the dataset's potential in future research. The DOTA-ME-CS dataset, along with accompanying code, will be made publicly available.</p></details> |  |
| **[Coxeter codes: Extending the Reed-Muller family](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.14746v3)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Binary Reed-Muller (RM) codes are defined via evaluations of Boolean-valued functions on $\mathbb{Z}_2^m$. We introduce a class of binary linear codes that generalizes the RM family by replacing the domain $\mathbb{Z}_2^m$ with an arbitrary finite Coxeter group. Like RM codes, this class is closed under duality, forms a nested code sequence, satisfies a multiplication property, and has asymptotic rate determined by a Gaussian distribution. Coxeter codes also give rise to a family of quantum codes for which transversal diagonal $Z$ rotations can perform non-trivial logic.</p></details> | <details><summary>v1: E...</summary><p>v1: Extended abstract, v2: full paper, v3 has added new material on quantum Coxeter code and a remark on decoding Coxeter codes.

| **[A Large-Scale Collection Of (Non-)Actionable Static Code Analysis Reports](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10323v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Static Code Analysis (SCA) tools, while invaluable for identifying potential coding problems, functional bugs, or vulnerabilities, often generate an overwhelming number of warnings, many of which are non-actionable. This overload of alerts leads to ``alert fatigue'', a phenomenon where developers become desensitized to warnings, potentially overlooking critical issues and ultimately hindering productivity and code quality. Analyzing these warnings and training machine learning models to identify and filter them requires substantial datasets, which are currently scarce, particularly for Java. This scarcity impedes efforts to improve the accuracy and usability of SCA tools and mitigate the effects of alert fatigue. In this paper, we address this gap by introducing a novel methodology for collecting and categorizing SCA warnings, effectively distinguishing actionable from non-actionable ones. We further leverage this methodology to generate a large-scale dataset of over 1 million entries of Java source code warnings, named NASCAR: (Non-)Actionable Static Code Analysis Reports. To facilitate follow-up research in this domain, we make both the dataset and the tools used to generate it publicly available.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under publication to Nature Scientific Data journal</p></details> |
| **[The Impact of Large Language Models (LLMs) on Code Review Process](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.11034v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have recently gained prominence in the field of software development, significantly boosting productivity and simplifying teamwork. Although prior studies have examined task-specific applications, the phase-specific effects of LLM assistance on the efficiency of code review processes remain underexplored. This research investigates the effect of GPT on GitHub pull request (PR) workflows, with a focus on reducing resolution time, optimizing phase-specific performance, and assisting developers. We curated a dataset of 25,473 PRs from 9,254 GitHub projects and identified GPT-assisted PRs using a semi-automated heuristic approach that combines keyword-based detection, regular expression filtering, and manual verification until achieving 95% labeling accuracy. We then applied statistical modeling, including multiple linear regression and Mann-Whitney U test, to evaluate differences between GPT-assisted and non-assisted PRs, both at the overall resolution level and across distinct review phases. Our research has revealed that early adoption of GPT can substantially boost the effectiveness of the PR process, leading to considerable time savings at various stages. Our findings suggest that GPT-assisted PRs reduced median resolution time by more than 60% (9 hours compared to 23 hours for non-assisted PRs). We discovered that utilizing GPT can reduce the review time by 33% and the waiting time before acceptance by 87%. Analyzing a sample dataset of 300 GPT-assisted PRs, we discovered that developers predominantly use GPT for code optimization (60%), bug fixing (26%), and documentation updates (12%). This research sheds light on the impact of the GPT model on the code review process, offering actionable insights for software teams seeking to enhance workflows and promote seamless collaboration.</p></details> |  |
| **[Quality Assurance of LLM-generated Code: Addressing Non-Functional Quality Characteristics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10271v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, LLMs have been widely integrated into software engineering workflows, supporting tasks like code generation. However, while these models often generate functionally correct outputs, we still lack a systematic understanding and evaluation of their non-functional qualities. Existing studies focus mainly on whether generated code passes the tests rather than whether it passes with quality. Guided by the ISO/IEC 25010 quality model, this study conducted three complementary investigations: a systematic review of 108 papers, two industry workshops with practitioners from multiple organizations, and an empirical analysis of patching real-world software issues using three LLMs. Motivated by insights from both the literature and practitioners, the empirical study examined the quality of generated patches on security, maintainability, and performance efficiency. Across the literature, we found that security and performance efficiency dominate academic attention, while maintainability and other qualities are understudied. In contrast, industry experts prioritize maintainability and readability, warning that generated code may accelerate the accumulation of technical debt. In our evaluation of functionally correct patches generated by three LLMs, improvements in one quality dimension often come at the cost of others. Runtime and memory results further show high variance across models and optimization strategies. Overall, our findings reveal a mismatch between academic focus, industry priorities, and model performance, highlighting the urgent need to integrate quality assurance mechanisms into LLM code generation pipelines to ensure that future generated code not only passes tests but truly passes with quality.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Assisted Multiple-Antenna Coded Caching](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.19248v2)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) has emerged as a promising technology to enhance the wireless propagation environment for next-generation wireless communication systems. This paper introduces a new RIS-assisted multiple-antenna coded caching problem. Unlike the existing multi-antenna coded caching models, our considered model incorporates a passive RIS with a limited number of elements aimed at enhancing the multicast gain (i.e., Degrees of Freedom (DoF)). The system consists of a server equipped with multiple antennas and several single-antenna users. The RIS, which functions as a passive and configurable relay, improves communication by selectively erasing certain transmission paths between transmit and receive antennas, thereby reducing interference. We first propose a new RIS-assisted interference nulling algorithm to determine the phase-shift coefficients of the RIS. This algorithm achieves faster convergence compared to the existing approach. By strategically nulling certain interference paths in each time slot, the transmission process is divided into multiple interference-free groups. Each group consists of a set of transmit antennas that serve a corresponding set of users without any interference from other groups. The optimal grouping strategy to maximize the DoF is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem. To efficiently solve this, we design a low-complexity algorithm that identifies the optimal solution and develops a corresponding coded caching scheme to achieve the maximum DoF. Building on the optimal grouping strategy, we introduce a new framework, referred to as RIS-assisted Multiple-Antenna Placement Delivery Array (RMAPDA), to construct the cache placement and delivery phases. Then we propose a general RMAPDA design to achieve the maximum DoF under the optimal grouping strategy.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE Trans.

| **[Generalized Spectral Bound for Quasi-Twisted Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10066v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semenov and Trifonov [22] developed a spectral theory for quasi-cyclic codes and formulated a BCH-like minimum distance bound. Their approach was generalized by Zeh and Ling [24], by using the HT bound. The first spectral bound for quasi-twisted codes appeared in [7], which generalizes Semenov-Trifonov and Zeh-Ling bounds, but its overall performance was observed to be worse than the Jensen bound. More recently, an improved spectral bound for quasi-cyclic codes was proposed in [15], which outperforms the Jensen bound in many cases. In this paper, we adopt this approach to quasi-twisted case and we show that this new generalized spectral bound provides tighter lower bounds on the minimum distance compared to the Jensen and Ezerman et. al. bounds.</p></details> |  |
| **[EnvTrace: Simulation-Based Semantic Evaluation of LLM Code via Execution Trace Alignment -- Demonstrated at Synchrotron Beamlines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09964v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating large language models (LLMs) for instrument control requires methods that go beyond standard, stateless algorithmic benchmarks, since the behavior of physical systems cannot be fully captured by unit tests alone. Here we introduce EnvTrace, a simulation-based method that evaluates execution traces to assess semantic code equivalence. EnvTrace is demonstrated with a beamline control-logic digital twin to facilitate the evaluation of instrument control code, with the digital twin itself also enabling the pre-execution validation of live experiments. Over 30 LLMs were evaluated using trace alignment to generate a multi-faceted score for functional correctness across key behavioral dimensions, showing that many top-tier models can approach human-level performance in rapid control-code generation. This is a first step toward a broader vision where LLMs and digital twins work symbiotically: LLMs providing intuitive control and agentic orchestration, and digital twins offering safe and high-fidelity environments, paving the way towards autonomous embodied AI.</p></details> |  |
| **[Taught by the Flawed: How Dataset Insecurity Breeds Vulnerable AI Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09879v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI programming assistants have demonstrated a tendency to generate code containing basic security vulnerabilities. While developers are ultimately responsible for validating and reviewing such outputs, improving the inherent quality of these generated code snippets remains essential. A key contributing factor to insecure outputs is the presence of vulnerabilities in the training datasets used to build large language models (LLMs). To address this issue, we propose curating training data to include only code that is free from detectable vulnerabilities. In this study, we constructed a secure dataset by filtering an existing Python corpus using a static analysis tool to retain only vulnerability-free functions. We then trained two transformer-based models: one on the curated dataset and one on the original, unfiltered dataset. The models were evaluated on both the correctness and security of the code they generated in response to natural language function descriptions. Our results show that the model trained on the curated dataset produced outputs with fewer security issues, while maintaining comparable functional correctness. These findings highlight the importance of secure training data in improving the reliability of AI-based programming assistants, though further enhancements to model architecture and evaluation are needed to reinforce these outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rethinking the Evaluation of Secure Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.15554v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are widely used in software development. However, the code generated by LLMs often contains vulnerabilities. Several secure code generation methods have been proposed to address this issue, but their current evaluation schemes leave several concerns unaddressed. Specifically, most existing studies evaluate security and functional correctness separately, using different datasets. That is, they assess vulnerabilities using security-related code datasets while validating functionality with general code datasets. In addition, prior research primarily relies on a single static analyzer, CodeQL, to detect vulnerabilities in generated code, which limits the scope of security evaluation. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive study to systematically assess the improvements introduced by four state-of-the-art secure code generation techniques. Specifically, we apply both security inspection and functionality validation to the same generated code and evaluate these two aspects together. We also employ three popular static analyzers and two LLMs to identify potential vulnerabilities in the generated code. Our study reveals that existing techniques often compromise the functionality of generated code to enhance security. Their overall performance remains limited when evaluating security and functionality together. In fact, many techniques even degrade the performance of the base LLM by more than 50%. Our further inspection reveals that these techniques often either remove vulnerable lines of code entirely or generate ``garbage code'' that is unrelated to the intended task. Moreover, the commonly used static analyzer CodeQL fails to detect several vulnerabilities, further obscuring the actual security improvements achieved by existing techniques.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ICSE 2026</p></details> |
| **[Evaluating Software Process Models for Multi-Agent Class-Level Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09794v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern software systems require code that is not only functional but also maintainable and well-structured. Although Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate software development, most studies focus on isolated, single-agent function-level generation. This work examines how process structure and role specialization shape multi-agent LLM workflows for class-level code generation. We simulate a Waterfall-style development cycle covering Requirement, Design, Implementation, and Testing using three LLMs (GPT-4o-mini, DeepSeek-Chat, and Claude-3.5-Haiku) on 100 Python tasks from the ClassEval benchmark. Our findings show that multi-agent workflows reorganize, rather than consistently enhance, model performance. Waterfall-style collaboration produces cleaner and more maintainable code but often reduces functional correctness (-37.8\% for GPT-4o-mini and -39.8\% for DeepSeek-Chat), with Claude-3.5-Haiku as a notable exception (+9.5\%). Importantly, process constraints shift failure characteristics: structural issues such as missing code decrease, while semantic and validation errors become more frequent. Among all stages, Testing exerts the strongest influence by improving verification coverage but also introducing new reasoning failures, whereas Requirement and Design have comparatively modest effects. Overall, this study provides empirical evidence that software process structure fundamentally alters how LLMs reason, collaborate, and fail, revealing inherent trade-offs between rigid workflow discipline and flexible problem-solving in multi-agent code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Function-Correcting Codes for Locally Bounded Functions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.07804v3)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we introduce a class of functions that assume only a limited number $λ$ of values within a given Hamming $ρ$-ball and call them locally $(ρ, λ)$-bounded functions. We develop function-correcting codes (FCCs) for a subclass of these functions and propose an upper bound on the redundancy of FCCs. The bound is based on the minimum length of an error-correcting code with a given number of codewords and a minimum distance. Furthermore, we provide a sufficient optimality condition for FCCs when $λ= 4$. We also demonstrate that any function can be represented as a locally $(ρ, λ)$-bounded function, illustrating this with a representation of Hamming weight distribution functions. Furthermore, we present another construction of function-correcting codes for Hamming weight distribution functions.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version corrects Lemma 1 by adding a missing condition required for its validity.

| **[Multi-step Predictive Coding Leads To Simplicity Bias](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09290v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Predictive coding is a framework for understanding the formation of low-dimensional internal representations mirroring the environment's latent structure. The conditions under which such representations emerge remain unclear. In this work, we investigate how the prediction horizon and network depth shape the solutions of predictive coding tasks. Using a minimal abstract setting inspired by prior work, we show empirically and theoretically that sufficiently deep networks trained with multi-step prediction horizons consistently recover the underlying latent structure, a phenomenon explained through the Ordinary Least Squares estimator structure and biases in learning dynamics. We then extend these insights to nonlinear networks and complex datasets, including piecewise linear functions, MNIST, multiple latent states and higher dimensional state geometries. Our results provide a principled understanding of when and why predictive coding induces structured representations, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical foundations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoding the Configuration of AI Coding Agents: Insights from Claude Code Projects](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09268v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic code assistants are a new generation of AI systems capable of performing end-to-end software engineering tasks. While these systems promise unprecedented productivity gains, their behavior and effectiveness depend heavily on configuration files that define architectural constraints, coding practices, and tool usage policies. However, little is known about the structure and content of these configuration artifacts. This paper presents an empirical study of the configuration ecosystem of Claude Code, one of the most widely used agentic coding systems. We collected and analyzed 328 configuration files from public Claude Code projects to identify (i) the software engineering concerns and practices they specify and (ii) how these concerns co-occur within individual files. The results highlight the importance of defining a wide range of concerns and practices in agent configuration files, with particular emphasis on specifying the architecture the agent should follow.</p></details> |  |
| **[Generic Construction of Optimal-Access Binary MDS Array Codes with Smaller Sub-packetization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09251v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A $(k+r,k,l)$ binary array code of length $k+r$, dimension $k$, and sub-packetization $l$ is composed of $l\times(k+r)$ matrices over $\mathbb{F}_2$, with every column of the matrix stored on a separate node in the distributed storage system and viewed as a coordinate of the codeword. It is said to be maximum distance separable (MDS) if any $k$ out of $k+r$ coordinates suffice to reconstruct the whole codeword. The repair problem of binary MDS array codes has drawn much attention, particularly for single-node failures. In this paper, given an arbitrary binary MDS array code with sub-packetization $m$ as the base code, we propose two generic approaches (Generic Construction I and II) for constructing binary MDS array codes with optimal access (or repair) bandwidth for single-node failures. For every $s\leq r$, a $(k+r,k,ms^{\lceil \frac{k+r}{s}\rceil})$ code $\mathcal{C}_1$ with optimal access bandwidth can be constructed by Generic Construction I. Repairing a failed node of $\mathcal{C}_1$ requires connecting to $d = k+s-1$ helper nodes, in which $s-1$ helper nodes are designated and $k$ are free to select. $\mathcal{C}_1$ generally achieves smaller sub-packetization and provides greater flexibility in the selection of its coefficient matrices. For even $r\geq4$ and $s=\frac{r}{2}$ such that $s+1$ divides $k+r$, a $(k+r, k,ms^{\frac{k+r}{s+1}})$ code $\mathcal{C}_2$ with optimal repair bandwidth can be constructed by Generic Construction II, with $\frac{s}{s+1}(k+r)$ out of $k+r$ nodes having the optimal access property. To the best of our knowledge, $\mathcal{C}_2$ possesses the smallest sub-packetization among existing binary MDS array codes with optimal repair bandwidth known to date.</p></details> |  |
| **[AILINKPREVIEWER: Enhancing Code Reviews with LLM-Powered Link Previews](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09223v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is a key practice in software engineering, where developers evaluate code changes to ensure quality and maintainability. Links to issues and external resources are often included in Pull Requests (PRs) to provide additional context, yet they are typically discarded in automated tasks such as PR summarization and code review comment generation. This limits the richness of information available to reviewers and increases cognitive load by forcing context-switching. To address this gap, we present AILINKPREVIEWER, a tool that leverages Large Language Models (LLMs) to generate previews of links in PRs using PR metadata, including titles, descriptions, comments, and link body content. We analyzed 50 engineered GitHub repositories and compared three approaches: Contextual LLM summaries, Non-Contextual LLM summaries, and Metadata-based previews. The results in metrics such as BLEU, BERTScore, and compression ratio show that contextual summaries consistently outperform other methods. However, in a user study with seven participants, most preferred non-contextual summaries, suggesting a trade-off between metric performance and perceived usability. These findings demonstrate the potential of LLM-powered link previews to enhance code review efficiency and to provide richer context for developers and automation in software engineering. The video demo is available at https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2qH4RtrB3E, and the tool and its source code can be found at https://github.com/c4rtune/AILinkPreviewer.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning Binary Autoencoder-Based Codes with Progressive Training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09221v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Error correcting codes play a central role in digital communication, ensuring that transmitted information can be accurately reconstructed despite channel impairments. Recently, autoencoder (AE) based approaches have gained attention for the end-to-end design of communication systems, offering a data driven alternative to conventional coding schemes. However, enforcing binary codewords within differentiable AE architectures remains difficult, as discretization breaks gradient flow and often leads to unstable convergence. To overcome this limitation, a simplified two stage training procedure is proposed, consisting of a continuous pretraining phase followed by direct binarization and fine tuning without gradient approximation techniques. For the (7,4) block configuration over a binary symmetric channel (BSC), the learned encoder-decoder pair learns a rotated version (coset code) of the optimal Hamming code, naturally recovering its linear and distance properties and thereby achieving the same block error rate (BLER) with maximum likelihood (ML) decoding. These results indicate that compact AE architectures can effectively learn structured, algebraically optimal binary codes through stable and straightforward training.</p></details> | <details><summary>Invit...</summary><p>Invited paper at TELFOR 2025</p></details> |
| **[Vendor-Aware Industrial Agents: RAG-Enhanced LLMs for Secure On-Premise PLC Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09122v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Programmable Logic Controllers are operated by proprietary code dialects; this makes it challenging to train coding assistants. Current LLMs are trained on large code datasets and are capable of writing IEC 61131-3 compatible code out of the box, but they neither know specific function blocks, nor related project code. Moreover, companies like Mitsubishi Electric and their customers do not trust cloud providers. Hence, an own coding agent is the desired solution to cope with this. In this study, we present our work on a low-data domain coding assistant solution for industrial use. We show how we achieved high quality code generation without fine-tuning large models and by fine-tuning small local models for edge device usage. Our tool lets several AI models compete with each other, uses reasoning, corrects bugs automatically and checks code validity by compiling it directly in the chat interface. We support our approach with an extensive evaluation that comes with code compilation statistics and user ratings. We found that a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) supported coding assistant can work in low-data domains by using extensive prompt engineering and directed retrieval.</p></details> |  |
| **[Color Multiset Codes based on Sunmao Construction](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09070v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present results on coding using multisets instead of ordered sequences. The study is motivated by a moving object tracking problem in a sensor network and can find applications in settings where the order of the symbols in a codeword cannot be maintained or observed. In this paper a multiset coding scheme is proposed on source data that can be organized as a flat or cyclic multi-dimensional integer lattice (grid). A fundamental idea in the solution approach is to decompose the original source data grid into sub-grids. The original multiset coding problem can then be restricted to each of the sub-grid. Solutions for the sub-grids are subsequently piece together to form the desired solution. We name this circle of idea as sunmao construction in reference to woodwork construction method with ancient origin. Braid codes are specific solutions defined using the sunmao construction. They are easy to define for multi-dimensional grids. Moreover for a code of a given code set size and multiset cardinality, if we measure coding efficiency by the number of distinct symbols required, then braid codes have asymptotic order equal to those that are optimal. We also show that braid codes have interesting inherent error correction properties.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This work has been submitted for possible publication</p></details> |
| **[Policy-Guided MCTS for near Maximum-Likelihood Decoding of Short Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09054v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we propose a policy-guided Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) decoder that achieves near maximum-likelihood decoding (MLD) performance for short block codes. The MCTS decoder searches for test error patterns (TEPs) in the received information bits and obtains codeword candidates through re-encoding. The TEP search is executed on a tree structure, guided by a neural network policy trained via MCTS-based learning. The trained policy guides the decoder to find the correct TEPs with minimal steps from the root node (all-zero TEP). The decoder outputs the codeword with maximum likelihood when the early stopping criterion is satisfied. The proposed method requires no Gaussian elimination (GE) compared to ordered statistics decoding (OSD) and can reduce search complexity by 95\% compared to non-GE OSD. It achieves lower decoding latency than both OSD and non-GE OSD at high SNRs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Kodezi Chronos: A Debugging-First Language Model for Repository-Scale Code Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12482v3)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have advanced code generation and software automation but remain constrained by inference-time context and lack structured reasoning over code, leaving debugging largely unsolved. While Claude 4.5 Sonnet and Claude 4.1 Opus exceed 70% on code synthesis benchmarks, they achieve under 15% on real debugging tasks. We introduce Kodezi Chronos, a language model purpose-built for debugging that integrates Adaptive Graph-Guided Retrieval to traverse codebases up to 10 million lines, Persistent Debug Memory trained on over 15 million sessions, and a seven-layer fix-test-refine architecture. On 5,000 real-world scenarios, Chronos achieves 67.3% fix accuracy compared to 14.2% and 13.8% for Claude 4.1 Opus and GPT-4.1, respectively. On SWE-bench Lite, Chronos reaches a state-of-the-art 80.33% resolution rate (241 of 300), outperforming the next best system by 20 points and achieving repository-specific highs of 96.1% on Sympy and 90.4% on Django. Chronos reduces debugging time by 40% and iterations by 65%, resolving complex multi-file and cross-repository bugs. It remains limited on hardware-dependent and dynamic language errors. Chronos will be available in Kodezi OS in Q4 2025 and via API in Q1 2026.</p></details> | <details><summary>23 fi...</summary><p>23 figures, 40 tables, 2 algorithms. Extended technical report.

Over larger-yet still constant-sized-fields, algebraic-geometry codes are known to beat the GV bound. In this work, we leverage this phenomenon by taking traces of AG codes. Our hope is that the margin by which AG codes exceed the GV bound will withstand the parameter loss incurred by taking the trace from a constant field extension to the binary field. In contrast to concatenation, the usual alphabet-reduction method, our analysis of trace-of-AG (TAG) codes uses the AG codes' algebraic structure throughout - including in the alphabet-reduction step. Our main technical contribution is a Hasse-Weil-type theorem that is well-suited for the analysis of TAG codes. The classical theorem (and its Grothendieck trace-formula extension) are inadequate in this setting. Although we do not obtain improved constructions, we show that a constant-factor strengthening of our bound would suffice. We also analyze the limitations of TAG codes under our bound and prove that, in the high-distance regime, they are inferior to code concatenation. Our Hasse-Weil-type theorem holds in far greater generality than is needed for analyzing TAG codes. In particular, we derive new estimates for exponential sums.</p></details> |  |

In the proposed algorithm, each agent conducts a periodic singular value decomposition on its learned subspaces and exchanges truncated basis matrices, based on which the fused subspaces are obtained. By introducing a projection matrix and minimizing the distance between the outputs and its projection, the learned representations are enforced towards the fused subspaces. It is proved that the trace on the coding-rate change is bounded and the consistency of basis fusion is guaranteed theoretically. Numerical simulations validate that the proposed algorithm achieves high classification accuracy while maintaining representations' diversity, compared to baselines showing correlated subspaces and coupled representations.</p></details> |  |

Existing benchmarks often focus on algorithmic problems or Python-centric bug fixing, leaving critical dimensions of software engineering underexplored. To address these gaps, we introduce SWE-Compass1, a comprehensive benchmark that unifies heterogeneous code-related evaluations into a structured and production-aligned framework. SWE-Compass spans 8 task types, 8 programming scenarios, and 10 programming languages, with 2000 high-quality instances curated from authentic GitHub pull requests and refined through systematic filtering and validation. We benchmark ten state-of-the-art LLMs under two agentic frameworks, SWE-Agent and Claude Code, revealing a clear hierarchy of difficulty across task types, languages, and scenarios. Moreover, by aligning evaluation with real-world developer practices, SWE-Compass provides a rigorous and reproducible foundation for diagnosing and advancing agentic coding capabilities in large language models.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods face challenges such as semantic gaps between clinical text and ICD codes, poor performance on rare and long-tail codes, and limited interpretability. To address these issues, we propose TraceCoder, a novel framework integrating multi-source external knowledge to enhance traceability and explainability in ICD coding. TraceCoder dynamically incorporates diverse knowledge sources, including UMLS, Wikipedia, and large language models (LLMs), to enrich code representations, bridge semantic gaps, and handle rare and ambiguous codes. It also introduces a hybrid attention mechanism to model interactions among labels, clinical context, and knowledge, improving long-tail code recognition and making predictions interpretable by grounding them in external evidence. Experiments on MIMIC-III-ICD9, MIMIC-IV-ICD9, and MIMIC-IV-ICD10 datasets demonstrate that TraceCoder achieves state-of-the-art performance, with ablation studies validating the effectiveness of its components. TraceCoder offers a scalable and robust solution for automated ICD coding, aligning with clinical needs for accuracy, interpretability, and reliability.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accpe...</summary><p>Accpeted as BIBM 2025 Regular. 6 pages.

In this work, we introduce Cartesian square-free codes, which are linear codes generated by evaluating square-free monomials over a Cartesian set. We use commutative algebraic tools, specifically the footprint bound, to provide explicit formulas for some of the GHWs of this family of codes, and we show how we can translate these results to evaluation codes over the projective space.</p></details> |  |

Building upon previously established converse arguments and achievability schemes by Jia et al., in this work we develop a set of new converse arguments and coding designs that enable us to completely characterize the fundamental limits of RDCDS with partially storage constrained servers, i.e., the minimum number of available servers for feasible update operation and the minimum communication costs for read and update operations across various server dropout scenarios.</p></details> |  |
| **[Re-coding for Uncertainties: Edge-awareness Semantic Concordance for Resilient Event-RGB Segmentation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08269v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semantic segmentation has achieved great success in ideal conditions. However, when facing extreme conditions (e.g., insufficient light, fierce camera motion), most existing methods suffer from significant information loss of RGB, severely damaging segmentation results. Several researches exploit the high-speed and high-dynamic event modality as a complement, but event and RGB are naturally heterogeneous, which leads to feature-level mismatch and inferior optimization of existing multi-modality methods. Different from these researches, we delve into the edge secret of both modalities for resilient fusion and propose a novel Edge-awareness Semantic Concordance framework to unify the multi-modality heterogeneous features with latent edge cues. In this framework, we first propose Edge-awareness Latent Re-coding, which obtains uncertainty indicators while realigning event-RGB features into unified semantic space guided by re-coded distribution, and transfers event-RGB distributions into re-coded features by utilizing a pre-established edge dictionary as clues. We then propose Re-coded Consolidation and Uncertainty Optimization, which utilize re-coded edge features and uncertainty indicators to solve the heterogeneous event-RGB fusion issues under extreme conditions. We establish two synthetic and one real-world event-RGB semantic segmentation datasets for extreme scenario comparisons. Experimental results show that our method outperforms the state-of-the-art by a 2.55% mIoU on our proposed DERS-XS, and possesses superior resilience under spatial occlusion.

| **[T-GVC: Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding at Ultra-Low Bitrates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.07633v4)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in video generation techniques have given rise to an emerging paradigm of generative video coding for Ultra-Low Bitrate (ULB) scenarios by leveraging powerful generative priors. However, most existing methods are limited by domain specificity (e.g., facial or human videos) or excessive dependence on high-level text guidance, which tend to inadequately capture fine-grained motion details, leading to unrealistic or incoherent reconstructions. To address these challenges, we propose Trajectory-Guided Generative Video Coding (dubbed T-GVC), a novel framework that bridges low-level motion tracking with high-level semantic understanding. T-GVC features a semantic-aware sparse motion sampling pipeline that extracts pixel-wise motion as sparse trajectory points based on their semantic importance, significantly reducing the bitrate while preserving critical temporal semantic information. In addition, by integrating trajectory-aligned loss constraints into diffusion processes, we introduce a training-free guidance mechanism in latent space to ensure physically plausible motion patterns without sacrificing the inherent capabilities of generative models. Experimental results demonstrate that T-GVC outperforms both traditional and neural video codecs under ULB conditions. Furthermore, additional experiments confirm that our framework achieves more precise motion control than existing text-guided methods, paving the way for a novel direction of generative video coding guided by geometric motion modeling.</p></details> |  |

Recent advances in visual language models (VLMs) highlight the potential of automatic UI coding, but current approaches face two key limitations: multimodal coding capabilities remain underdeveloped, and single-turn paradigms make little use of iterative visual feedback. We address these challenges with an interactive UI-to-code paradigm that better reflects real-world workflows and raises the upper bound of achievable performance. Under this paradigm, we present UI2Code$^\text{N}$, a visual language model trained through staged pretraining, fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning to achieve foundational improvements in multimodal coding. The model unifies three key capabilities: UI-to-code generation, UI editing, and UI polishing. We further explore test-time scaling for interactive generation, enabling systematic use of multi-turn feedback. Experiments on UI-to-code and UI polishing benchmarks show that UI2Code$^\text{N}$ establishes a new state of the art among open-source models and achieves performance comparable to leading closed-source models such as Claude-4-Sonnet and GPT-5. Our code and models are available at https://github.com/zai-org/UI2Code_N.</p></details> | 24 pages |

However, their output quality hinges on the contextual richness of the prompts. Meanwhile, gaze behaviour carries rich cognitive information, providing insights into how developers process code. We leverage this in Real-time GazeCopilot, a novel approach that refines prompts using real-time gaze data to improve code comprehension and readability by integrating gaze metrics, like fixation patterns and pupil dilation, into prompts to adapt suggestions to developers' cognitive states. In a controlled lab study with 25 developers, we evaluated Real-time GazeCopilot against two baselines: Standard Copilot, which relies on text prompts provided by developers, and Pre-set GazeCopilot, which uses a hard-coded prompt that assumes developers' gaze metrics indicate they are struggling with all aspects of the code, allowing us to assess the impact of leveraging the developer's personal real-time gaze data. Our results show that prompts dynamically generated using developers' real-time gaze data significantly improve code comprehension accuracy, reduce comprehension time, and improve perceived readability compared to Standard Copilot. Our Real-time GazeCopilot approach selectively refactors only code aspects where gaze data indicate difficulty, outperforming the overgeneralized refactoring done by Pre-set GazeCopilot by avoiding revising code the developer already understands.</p></details> |  |

The recent explosive development of LLM extends the family of SCMs,bringing LLMs for code that revolutionize development workflows. Investigating different kinds of SCM vulnerability is the cornerstone for the security and trustworthiness of AI-powered software ecosystems, however, the fundamental one, transferable vulnerability, remains critically underexplored. Existing studies neither offer practical ways, i.e. require access to the downstream classifier of SCMs, to produce effective adversarial samples for adversarial defense, nor give heed to the widely used LLM4Code in modern software development platforms and cloud-based integrated development environments. Therefore, this work systematically studies the intrinsic vulnerability transferability of both traditional SCMs and LLM4Code, and proposes a victim-agnostic approach to generate practical adversarial samples. We design HABITAT, consisting of a tailored perturbation-inserting mechanism and a hierarchical Reinforcement Learning framework that adaptively selects optimal perturbations without requiring any access to the downstream classifier of SCMs. Furthermore, an intrinsic transferability analysis of SCM vulnerabilities is conducted, revealing the potential vulnerability correlation between traditional SCMs and LLM4Code, together with fundamental factors that govern the success rate of victim-agnostic transfer attacks. These findings of SCM vulnerabilities underscore the critical focal points for developing robust defenses in the future. Experimental evaluation demonstrates that our constructed adversarial examples crafted based on traditional SCMs achieve up to 64% success rates against LLM4Code, surpassing the state-of-the-art by over 15%.</p></details> |  |

While this lowers barriers to software creation, it also collapses the boundary between prototypes and engineered software, leading to fragile systems that lack robustness, security, and maintainability. We argue that this shift motivates a reimagining of software models. Rather than serving only as upfront blueprints, models can be recovered post-hoc from AI-generated code to restore comprehension, expose risks, and guide refinement. In this role, models serve as mediators between human intent, AI generation, and long-term system evolution, providing a path toward sustainable AI-driven software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Updat...</summary><p>Updated the bibliography to remove a few incorrect references and ensure all citations are accurate</p></details> |

However, the key research question of identifying reasoning steps that balance complexity and computational efficiency remains unsolved. Recent research has increasingly drawn upon psychological theories to explore strategies for optimizing cognitive pathways. The LLM's final outputs and intermediate steps are regarded as System 1 and System 2, respectively. However, an in-depth exploration of the System 2 reasoning is still lacking. Therefore, we propose a novel psychologically backed Scaffold Reasoning framework for code debugging, which encompasses the Scaffold Stream, Analytic Stream, and Integration Stream. The construction of reference code within the Scaffold Stream is integrated with the buggy code analysis results produced by the Analytic Stream through the Integration Stream. Our framework achieves an 88.91% pass rate and an average inference time of 5.36 seconds per-problem on DebugBench, outperforming other reasoning approaches across various LLMs in both reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Further analyses elucidate the advantages and limitations of various cognitive pathways across varying problem difficulties and bug types. Our findings also corroborate the alignment of the proposed Scaffold Reasoning framework with human cognitive processes.</p></details> | 5 pages, 2 figures |

This critical limitation, stemming from reliance on outdated API knowledge from their training data, even with access to current documentation, impedes reliable code generation in dynamic environments. To tackle this issue, we propose ReCode (rule-based Reinforcement learning for Code Update), a novel framework that mimics human programmer adaptation to API changes. Specifically, we construct a dataset of approximately 2,000 data entries to train the LLMs to perform version migration based on updated information. Then, we introduce a modified string similarity metric for code evaluation as the reward for reinforcement learning. Our experiments demonstrate that ReCode substantially boosts LLMs' code generation performance in dynamic API scenarios, especially on the unseen CodeUpdateArena task. Crucially, compared to supervised fine-tuning, ReCode has less impact on LLMs' general code generation abilities. We apply ReCode on various LLMs and reinforcement learning algorithms (GRPO and DAPO), all achieving consistent improvements. Notably, after training, Qwen2.5-Coder-7B outperforms that of the 32B parameter code instruction-tuned model and the reasoning model with the same architecture.

However, existing approaches such as Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) and its variants, while effective on reasoning benchmarks, struggle with agentic tasks that require iterative decision-making. We introduce Murphy, a multi-turn reflective optimization framework that extends GRPO by incorporating iterative self-correction during training. By leveraging both quantitative and qualitative execution feedback, Murphy enables models to progressively refine their reasoning across multiple turns. Evaluations on code generation benchmarks with model families such as Qwen and OLMo show that Murphy consistently improves performance, achieving up to a 8% relative gain in pass@1 over GRPO, on similar compute budgets.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 2 figures, 6 Tables</p></details> |
| **[Variable-Length Joint Source-Channel Coding for Semantic Communication](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07826v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates a key challenge faced by joint source-channel coding (JSCC) in digital semantic communication (SemCom): the incompatibility between existing JSCC schemes that yield continuous encoded representations and digital systems that employ discrete variable-length codewords. It further results in feasibility issues in achieving physical bit-level rate control via such JSCC approaches for efficient semantic transmission. In this paper, we propose a novel end-to-end coding (E2EC) framework to tackle it. The semantic coding problem is formed by extending the information bottleneck (IB) theory over noisy channels, which is a tradeoff between bit-level communication rate and semantic distortion. With a structural decomposition of encoding to handle code length and content respectively, we can construct an end-to-end trainable encoder that supports the direct compression of a data source into a finite codebook. To optimize our E2EC across non-differentiable operations, e.g., sampling, we use the powerful policy gradient to support gradient-based updates. Experimental results illustrate that E2EC achieves high inference quality with low bit rates, outperforming representative baselines compatible with digital SemCom systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Studying the Impact of Early Test Termination Due to Assertion Failure on Code Coverage and Spectrum-based Fault Localization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.04557v2)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An assertion is commonly used to validate the expected programs behavior (e.g., if the returned value of a method equals an expected value) in software testing. Although it is a recommended practice to use only one assertion in a single test to avoid code smells (e.g., Assertion Roulette), it is common to have multiple assertions in a single test. One issue with tests that have multiple assertions is that when the test fails at an early assertion (not the last one), the test will terminate at that point, and the remaining testing code will not be executed. This, in turn, can potentially reduce the code coverage and the performance of techniques that rely on code coverage information (e.g., spectrum-based fault localization). We refer to such a scenario as early test termination. Understanding the impact of early test termination on test coverage is important for software testing and debugging, particularly for the techniques that rely on coverage information obtained from the testing. We conducted the first empirical study on early test termination due to assertion failure (i.e., early test termination) by investigating 207 versions of 6 open-source projects. We found that a nonnegligible portion of the failed tests (19.1%) is early terminated due to assertion failure. Our findings indicate that early test termination harms both code coverage and the effectiveness of spectrum-based fault localization. For instance, after eliminating early test termination, the line/branch coverage is improved in 55% of the studied versions, and improves the performance of two popular SBFL techniques Ochiai and Tarantula by 15.1% and 10.7% compared to the original setting (without eliminating early test termination) in terms of MFR, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>One n...</summary><p>One new author has been added</p></details> |

Large language models (LLMs) although have brought impressive improvement to source code tasks, do not directly generalize to assembly code due to the unique challenges of assembly: (1) the low information density of assembly and (2) the diverse optimizations in assembly code. To overcome these challenges, this work proposes a hierarchical attention mechanism that builds attention summaries to capture the semantics more effectively and designs contrastive learning objectives to train LLMs to learn assembly optimization. Equipped with these techniques, this work develops Nova, a generative LLM for assembly code. Nova outperforms existing techniques on binary code decompilation by up to 14.84 -- 21.58% (absolute percentage point improvement) higher Pass@1 and Pass@10, and outperforms the latest binary code similarity detection techniques by up to 6.17% Recall@1, showing promising abilities on both assembly generation and understanding tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published as a conference paper at ICLR 2025</p></details> |

Traditionally, turbo product decoding passes log likelihood ratios (LLRs) between the component decoders, inherently losing information when bit correlation exists. Such correlation can arise exogenously from sources like intersymbol interference and endogenously during component code decoding. To preserve these correlations and improve performance, we propose turbo product decoding based on group probabilities. We theoretically predict mutual information and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) gains of group over bit-probability decoding. To translate these theoretical insights to practice, we revisit non-binary TPCs that naturally support group-probability decoding. We show that any component list decoder that takes group probabilities as input and outputs block-wise soft-output can partially preserve bit correlation, which we demonstrate with symbol-level ORBGRAND combined with soft-output GRAND (SOGRAND). Our results demonstrate that group-probability-based turbo product decoding achieves SNR gains of up to 0.3 dB for endogenous correlation and 0.7 dB for exogenous correlation, compared to bit-probability decoding.</p></details> |  |

A theoretical analysis of the performance-complexity tradeoff toward low-complexity decoding is required for a better understanding of the fundamental limits in the above-mentioned scenarios. This study aims to explore the performance of LDPC codes under belief propagation (BP) decoding with complexity constraints. In other words, for a small number of iterations, we present a closed-form lower bound on the bit error rate (BER) of LDPC codes as a function of complexity. Specifically, for the regular LDPC code ensembles, the dominant term in the order of the lower bound we provide matches that of the upper bound given by Lentmaier. Furthermore, for irregular LDPC code ensembles, in addition to adopting the approach used for regular codes, we also propose a method to iteratively obtain the lower bound on the average BER.</p></details> | <details><summary>arXiv...</summary><p>arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2012.13378 by other authors</p></details> |

While these advancements have streamlined complex workflows, they have also introduced critical safety and security risks. Current static safety benchmarks and red-teaming tools are inadequate for identifying emerging real-world risky scenarios, as they fail to cover certain boundary conditions, such as the combined effects of different jailbreak tools. In this work, we propose RedCodeAgent, the first automated red-teaming agent designed to systematically uncover vulnerabilities in diverse code agents. With an adaptive memory module, RedCodeAgent can leverage existing jailbreak knowledge, dynamically select the most effective red-teaming tools and tool combinations in a tailored toolbox for a given input query, thus identifying vulnerabilities that might otherwise be overlooked. For reliable evaluation, we develop simulated sandbox environments to additionally evaluate the execution results of code agents, mitigating potential biases of LLM-based judges that only rely on static code. Through extensive evaluations across multiple state-of-the-art code agents, diverse risky scenarios, and various programming languages, RedCodeAgent consistently outperforms existing red-teaming methods, achieving higher attack success rates and lower rejection rates with high efficiency. We further validate RedCodeAgent on real-world code assistants, e.g., Cursor and Codeium, exposing previously unidentified security risks. By automating and optimizing red-teaming processes, RedCodeAgent enables scalable, adaptive, and effective safety assessments of code agents.</p></details> |  |

Research has shown that code written in some paradigms can be harder to comprehend, but to date, no research has looked at which paradigm-specific language features impact comprehension. To this end, this study seeks to uncover which paradigm-specific features impactcomprehension and debugging of code or how multi-paradigm code might affect a developer's ability to do so. We present an exploratory empirical eye-tracking study to investigate 1) how developers classify the predominant paradigm in Python code and 2) how the paradigm affects their ability to debug Python code. The goal is to uncover if specific language features are looked at more often while classifying and debugging code with a predominant paradigm. Twenty-nine developers (primarily students) were recruited for the study and were each given four classification and four debugging tasks in Python. Eye movements were recorded during all the tasks. The results indicate confusion in labeling Functional and Procedural paradigms, but not Object-Oriented. The code with predominantly functional paradigms also took the longest to complete. Changing the predominant paradigm did not affect the ability to debug the code, though developers did rate themselves with lower confidence for Functional code. We report significant differences in reading patterns during debugging, especially in the Functional code. During classification, results show that developers do not necessarily read paradigm-relevant token types.</p></details> |  |

We identify two critical failure modes: \textit{logical hallucination} (incorrect control/data-flow reasoning) and \textit{schematic hallucination} (type mismatches, signature violations, and architectural inconsistencies). These errors stem from the absence of explicit, queryable representations of repository-wide semantics. This paper presents \textbf{SemanticForge}, which introduces four fundamental algorithmic advances for semantically-aware code generation: (1) a novel automatic reconciliation algorithm for dual static-dynamic knowledge graphs, unifying compile-time and runtime program semantics; (2) a neural approach that learns to generate structured graph queries from natural language, achieving 73\% precision versus 51\% for traditional retrieval; (3) a novel beam search algorithm with integrated SMT solving, enabling real-time constraint verification during generation rather than post-hoc validation; and (4) an incremental maintenance algorithm that updates knowledge graphs in $O(|ΔR| \cdot \log n)$ time while maintaining semantic equivalence.</p></details> |  |

We show that the tensor product of two algebraic geometry codes is robustly locally testable provided $n = Ω((k+g)^2)$. Apart from Reed-Solomon codes, this seems to be the first explicit family of two-wise tensor codes of high dual distance that is robustly locally testable by the natural test that measures the expected distance of a random row/column from the underlying code.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, accepted to RANDOM 2025, minor revision</p></details> |

However, low-resource languages (LRLs) like Bangla remain underrepresented due to the limited availability of instruction-to-code datasets and evaluation benchmarks. To address this, the BLP Workshop at IJCNLP-AACL 2025 introduced a shared task on "Code Generation in Bangla". In this work, we propose a method that combines instruction prompting with a test-driven, feedback-guided iterative refinement process using a fine-tuned Qwen2.5-14B model. The model generates code from Bangla instructions, tests it against unit tests, and iteratively refines any failing outputs through three evaluation passes, using test feedback to guide each step. This approach helped our team "Retriv" to secure 2nd place in the shared task with a Pass@1 score of 0.934. The analysis highlights challenges in Bangla instruction understanding and Python code generation, emphasizing the need for targeted methods in LRLs. We made experimental scripts publicly available for the community.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 1 figure, experimental scripts publicly available at https://github.com/NafiAsib/Retriv-BLP25-Task-2</p></details> |

While existing methods primarily enhance model understanding of code hierarchies and synonyms, they often overlook the pervasive use of medical acronyms in clinical notes, a key factor in ICD code inference. To address this gap, we propose a novel effective data augmentation technique that leverages large language models to expand medical acronyms, allowing models to be trained on their full form representations. Moreover, we incorporate consistency training to regularize predictions by enforcing agreement between the original and augmented documents. Extensive experiments on the MIMIC-III dataset demonstrate that our approach, ACE-ICD establishes new state-of-the-art performance across multiple settings, including common codes, rare codes, and full-code assignments.

If at least one of the original constituent codes does not have average weight exactly half of the dimension, then our method produces a new set of constituent codes in a higher dimension, with a strictly higher rate. Using our method we improve the highest known rate for the $T$-user binary adder channel for all $T \geq 2$. This information theory problem is equivalent to co-Sidon problems initiated by Lindstr{ö}m in the 1960s, and also the multi-set union-free problem. Our results improve the known lower bounds in these settings as well.</p></details> | 8 pages |

Our framework adapts powerful evolutionary concepts to the LLM domain, building upon recent methods for generalized scientific discovery. CodeEvolve employs an island-based genetic algorithm to maintain population diversity and increase throughput, introduces a novel inspiration-based crossover mechanism that leverages the LLMs context window to combine features from successful solutions, and implements meta-prompting strategies for dynamic exploration of the solution space. We conduct a rigorous evaluation of CodeEvolve on a subset of the mathematical benchmarks used to evaluate Google DeepMind's closed-source AlphaEvolve. Our findings show that our method surpasses AlphaEvolve's performance on several challenging problems.

However, a universal method for designing tailored IDS-correcting codes across varying channel settings remains underexplored. We present an autoencoder-based approach, THEA-code, aimed at efficiently generating IDS-correcting codes for complex IDS channels. In the work, a disturbance-based discretization is proposed to discretize the features of the autoencoder, and a simulated differentiable IDS channel is developed as a differentiable alternative for IDS operations. These innovations facilitate the successful convergence of the autoencoder, producing channel-customized IDS-correcting codes that demonstrate commendable performance across complex IDS channels, particularly in realistic DNA-based storage channels.</p></details> |  |

Open-source code, often protected by open source licenses (e.g, GPL), poses legal and ethical challenges when used in pretraining. Detecting whether specific code samples were included in LLM training data is thus critical for transparency, accountability, and copyright compliance. We propose SynPrune, a syntax-pruned membership inference attack method tailored for code. Unlike prior MIA approaches that treat code as plain text, SynPrune leverages the structured and rule-governed nature of programming languages. Specifically, it identifies and excludes consequent tokens that are syntactically required and not reflective of authorship, from attribution when computing membership scores. Experimental results show that SynPrune consistently outperforms the state-of-the-arts. Our method is also robust across varying function lengths and syntax categories.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper has been accepted by AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Benchmarking LLMs for Fine-Grained Code Review with Enriched Context in Practice](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07017v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is a cornerstone of software quality assurance, and recent advances in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in automating this process. However, existing benchmarks for LLM-based code review face three major limitations. (1) Lack of semantic context: most benchmarks provide only code diffs without textual information such as issue descriptions, which are crucial for understanding developer intent. (2) Data quality issues: without rigorous validation, many samples are noisy-e.g., reviews on outdated or irrelevant code-reducing evaluation reliability. (3) Coarse granularity: most benchmarks operate at the file or commit level, overlooking the fine-grained, line-level reasoning essential for precise review. We introduce ContextCRBench, a high-quality, context-rich benchmark for fine-grained LLM evaluation in code review. Our construction pipeline comprises: (1) Raw Data Crawling, collecting 153.7K issues and pull requests from top-tier repositories; (2) Comprehensive Context Extraction, linking issue-PR pairs for textual context and extracting the full surrounding function or class for code context; and (3) Multi-stage Data Filtering, combining rule-based and LLM-based validation to remove outdated, malformed, or low-value samples, resulting in 67,910 context-enriched entries. ContextCRBench supports three evaluation scenarios aligned with the review workflow: (1) hunk-level quality assessment, (2) line-level defect localization, and (3) line-level comment generation. Evaluating eight leading LLMs (four closed-source and four open-source) reveals that textual context yields greater performance gains than code context alone, while current LLMs remain far from human-level review ability. Deployed at ByteDance, ContextCRBench drives a self-evolving code review system, improving performance by 61.98% and demonstrating its robustness and industrial utility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rate-Optimal Streaming Codes Under an Extended Delay Profile for Three-Node Relay Networks With Burst Erasures](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06882v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper investigates streaming codes for three-node relay networks under burst packet erasures with a delay constraint $T$. In any sliding window of $T+1$ consecutive packets, the source-to-relay and relay-to-destination channels may introduce burst erasures of lengths at most $b_1$ and $b_2$, respectively. Let $u = \max\{b_1, b_2\}$ and $v = \min\{b_1, b_2\}$. Singhvi et al. proposed a construction achieving the optimal rate when $u\mid (T-u-v)$. In this paper, we present an extended delay profile method that attains the optimal rate under a relaxed constraint $\frac{T - u - v}{2u - v} \leq \left\lfloor \frac{T - u - v}{u} \right\rfloor$ and it strictly cover restriction $u\mid (T-u-v)$. %Furthermore, we demonstrate that the optimal rate for streaming codes is not achievable when $0< T-u-v<v$ under the convolutional code framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[Code Equivalence, Point Set Equivalence, and Polynomial Isomorphism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06843v1)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The linear code equivalence (LCE) problem is shown to be equivalent to the point set equivalence (PSE) problem, i.e., the problem to check whether two sets of points in a projective space over a finite field differ by a linear change of coordinates. For such a point set $\mathbb{X}$, let $R$ be its homogeneous coordinate ring and $\mathfrak{J}_{\mathbb{X}}$ its canonical ideal. Then the LCE problem is shown to be equivalent to an algebra isomorphism problem for the doubling $R/\mathfrak{J}_{\mathbb{X}}$. As this doubling is an Artinian Gorenstein algebra, we can use its Macaulay inverse system to reduce the LCE problem to a Polynomial Isomorphism (PI) problem for homogeneous polynomials. The last step is polynomial time under some mild assumptions about the codes. Moreover, for indecomposable iso-dual codes we can reduce the LCE search problem to the PI search problem of degree 3 by noting that the corresponding point sets are self-associated and arithmetically Gorenstein, so that we can use the isomorphism problem for the Artinian reductions of the coordinate rings and form their Macaulay inverse systems.</p></details> | 25 pages |

Existing code search datasets face limitations: they rely on human annotators who assess code primarily through semantic understanding rather than functional verification, leading to potential inaccuracies and scalability issues. Additionally, current evaluation metrics often overlook the multi-choice nature of code search. This paper introduces CoSQA+, pairing high-quality queries from CoSQA with multiple suitable codes. We develop an automated pipeline featuring multiple model-based candidate selections and the novel test-driven agent annotation system. Among a single Large Language Model (LLM) annotator and Python expert annotators (without test-based verification), agents leverage test-based verification and achieve the highest accuracy of 93.9%. Through extensive experiments, CoSQA+ has demonstrated superior quality over CoSQA. Models trained on CoSQA+ exhibit improved performance. We publicly release both CoSQA+_all, which contains 412,080 agent-annotated pairs, and CoSQA+_verified, which contains 1,000 human-verified pairs, at https://github.com/DeepSoftwareAnalytics/CoSQA_Plus.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to TSE 2025.

Using JavaParser, we extract pattern structures into JSON, then apply an NLG library to produce concise, context-aware summaries capturing roles, relationships, and usage intent. Empirical evaluation shows DPS summaries align closely with human-written ones (high ROUGE-L, BLEU-4, NIST, FrugalScore). A developer survey confirms DPS better preserves context than manual summaries.

Current methods on PCR mainly focus on the reviewer's perspective, including finding a capable reviewer, predicting comment quality, and recommending/generating review comments. However, it is not well studied that how to satisfy the review necessity requests posted by developers which can increase their visibility, which in turn acts as a prerequisite for better review responses. To this end, we propose K nowledge-guided P rompt learning for P ublic Code Review (KP-PCR) to achieve developer-based code review request quality assurance (i.e., predicting request necessity and recommending tags subtask). Specifically, we reformulate the two subtasks via 1) text prompt tuning which converts both of them into a Masked Language Model (MLM) by constructing prompt templates using hard prompt; and 2) knowledge and code prefix tuning which introduces knowledge guidance from fine-tuned large language models by soft prompt, and uses program dependence graph to characterize code snippets. Finally, both of the request necessity prediction and tag recommendation subtasks output predicted results through an answer engineering module. In addition, we further analysis the time complexity of our KP-PCR that has lightweight prefix based the operation of introducing knowledge guidance. Experimental results on the PCR dataset for the period 2011-2023 demonstrate that our KP-PCR outperforms baselines by 2.3%-8.4% in the request necessity prediction and by 1.4%-6.9% in the tag recommendation.

Achieving such phase alignment is technically challenging, as it requires tight synchronization among geographically distributed APs. In this paper, we address this issue by introducing a differential space-time block coding (DSTBC) approach that bypasses the need for AP phase synchronization. We first provide analytic bounds to the achievable spectral efficiency of CF-mMIMO with phase-unsynchronized APs. Then, we propose a DSTBC-based transmission scheme specifically tailored to CF-mMIMO, which operates without channel state information and does not require any form of phase synchronization among the APs. We derive a closed-form expression for the resulting signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR), enabling quantitative comparisons among different DSTBC schemes. Numerical simulations confirm that phase misalignments can significantly impair system performance. In contrast, the proposed DSTBC scheme successfully mitigates these effects, achieving performance comparable to that of fully synchronized systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Submi...</summary><p>Submitted to IEEE for possible publication.

However, as shown by many studies, writing or generating correct code to invoke APIs, particularly web APIs, is challenging.

In order to address this, we present WAPIIBench, a dataset and evaluation pipeline designed to assess the ability of LLMs to generate web API invocation code. Our experiments with several open-source LLMs reveal that generating API invocations poses a significant challenge, resulting in hallucinated endpoints, incorrect argument usage, and other errors.

We introduce White-Basilisk, a novel approach to vulnerability detection that demonstrates superior performance while challenging prevailing assumptions in AI model scaling. Utilizing an innovative architecture that integrates Mamba layers, linear self-attention, and a Mixture of Experts framework, White-Basilisk achieves state-of-the-art results in vulnerability detection tasks with a parameter count of only 200M. The model's capacity to process sequences of unprecedented length enables comprehensive analysis of extensive codebases in a single pass, surpassing the context limitations of current Large Language Models (LLMs). White-Basilisk exhibits robust performance on imbalanced, real-world datasets, while maintaining computational efficiency that facilitates deployment across diverse organizational scales. This research not only establishes new benchmarks in code security but also provides empirical evidence that compact, efficiently designed models can outperform larger counterparts in specialized tasks, potentially redefining optimization strategies in AI development for domain-specific applications.</p></details> |  |

Such a formulation of source coding is an alternative approach to the traditional framework and is inspired by an object tracking problem over proximity sensor networks. We define a \textit{multiset combinatorial Gray code} as a mulitset code with fixed multiset cardinality that possesses combinatorial Gray code characteristic. For source codes that are organized as a grid, namely an integer lattice, we propose a solution by first constructing a mapping from the grid to the alphabet set, the codes are then defined as the images of rectangular blocks in the grid of fixed dimensions. We refer to the mapping as a \textit{color mapping} and the code as a \textit{color multiset code}. We propose the idea of product multiset code that enables us to construct codes for high dimensional grids based on 1-dimensional (1D) grids. We provide a detailed analysis of color multiset codes on 1D grids, focusing on codes that require the minimal number of colors. To illustrate the application of such a coding scheme, we consider an object tracking problem on 2D grids and show its efficiency, which comes from exploiting transmission parallelism. Some numerical results are presented to conclude the paper.</p></details> | 36 pages, 7 figures |

In this work, we construct a family of $[[n,1,3]]$ non-CSS QECCs to achieve fault-tolerant (FT) syndrome measurement, where $ 6 \leq n \leq 10$. We employ the bare-ancilla method of Muyuan Li \emph{et al.} to demonstrate fault tolerance in the presence of hook errors during syndrome extraction. We present a systematic protocol for generating these QECCs using graph codes. Using a custom lookup-table decoder, we simulate the code's performance under both anisotropic and circuit-level depolarizing noise. Our results reveal a trade-off in performance with respect to the code rate and identify optimized codes under these noise models. We benchmark our results against the infamous flag-qubit method of Chao \emph{et al.}. Notably, we introduce a code with improved code rate while maintaining the same distance as the work of Muyuan Li \emph{et al.} Our approach facilitates the identification and construction of a family of distance three FT non-CSS QECCs.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, 6 figures, Supplementary material appended</p></details> |

Nevertheless, advances are dominated by mathematics (e.g., AIME), with competitive-programming code generation underexplored and data curation receiving less attention than RL algorithm design. We investigate how to construct RLVR datasets (i.e., RL prompts) and present practical training techniques that yield strong performance on competitive-programming code generation. Our pipeline begins with supervised fine-tuning (SFT) distilled from strong open-source models, augmented with general-purpose and reasoning-intensive data. RL then follows a two-stage process with executable, testcase-driven rewards: first, training on a large, uniformly distributed set of competitive-programming problems using Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) with 8 rollouts per prompt and a relatively short response-generation window (e.g., 32k during SFT and 24k in this stage) to expand entropy and mitigate repetition and truncation; second, we perform \textbf{Pre-GRPO}: updating on a small, high-quality set of challenging problems with a large rollout budget (64 rollouts per prompt) under a hard-focus curriculum that continuously retains the most difficult instances throughout training. We implement our method on Qwen2.5-32B and evaluate on LeetCode and Codeforces weekly contests to avoid data leakage. The resulting model achieves state-of-the-art performance among models of similar scale and is comparable to leading systems such as DeepSeek v3.1 and Doubao-1.5-Thinking. We also examine scaling trends and observe strong RL scaling on an internal large-scale MoE model. Our study distills concise best practices for data curation, entropy expansion, and curriculum design in RLVR for competitive-programming code generation.</p></details> | 15 pages, 8 figures |

While recent Vision-Language Models (VLMs) automate UI-to-Code generation, they generate only static HTML/CSS/JavaScript layouts lacking interactivity. To address this, we propose WebVIA, the first agentic framework for interactive UI-to-Code generation and validation. The framework comprises three components: 1) an exploration agent to capture multi-state UI screenshots; 2) a UI2Code model that generates executable interactive code; 3) a validation module that verifies the interactivity. Experiments demonstrate that WebVIA-Agent achieves more stable and accurate UI exploration than general-purpose agents (e.g., Gemini-2.5-Pro). In addition, our fine-tuned WebVIA-UI2Code models exhibit substantial improvements in generating executable and interactive HTML/CSS/JavaScript code, outperforming their base counterparts across both interactive and static UI2Code benchmarks. Our code and models are available at \href{https://zheny2751-dotcom.github.io/webvia.github.io/}{\texttt{https://webvia.github.io}}.</p></details> | 36 pages, 30 figures |

Large Language Models (LLMs) offer a promising solution, but their effectiveness depends heavily on how they are prompted. Unlike generic code summarization, test-code summarization poses distinct challenges because test methods validate expected behavior through assertions rather than implementing functionality. This paper presents a new benchmark of 91 real-world Java test cases paired with developer-written summaries and conducts a controlled ablation study to investigate how test code-related components-such as the method under test (MUT), assertion messages, and assertion semantics-affect the performance of LLM-generated test summaries. We evaluate four code LLMs (Codex, Codestral, DeepSeek, and Qwen-Coder) across seven prompt configurations using n-gram metrics (BLEU, ROUGE-L, METEOR), semantic similarity (BERTScore), and LLM-based evaluation. Results show that prompting with assertion semantics improves summary quality by an average of 0.10 points (2.3%) over full MUT context (4.45 vs. 4.35) while requiring fewer input tokens. Codex and Qwen-Coder achieve the highest alignment with human-written summaries, while DeepSeek underperforms despite high lexical overlap.

| **[A Data-driven Analysis of Code Optimizations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.06117v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As the demand for computational power grows, optimizing code through compilers becomes increasingly crucial. In this context, we focus on fully automatic code optimization techniques that automate the process of selecting and applying code transformations for better performance without manual intervention. Understanding how these transformations behave and interact is key to designing more effective optimization strategies. Compiler developers must make numerous design choices when constructing these heuristics. For instance, they may decide whether to allow transformations to be explored in any arbitrary order or to enforce a fixed sequence. While the former may theoretically offer the best performance gains, it significantly increases the search space. This raises an important question: Can a predefined, fixed order of applying transformations speed up the search without severely compromising optimization potential? In this paper, we address this and other related questions that arise in the design of automatic code optimization algorithms. Using a data-driven approach, we generate a large dataset of random programs, apply random optimization sequences, and record their execution times. Through statistical analysis, we provide insights that guide the development of more efficient automatic code optimization algorithms.</p></details> |  |

However, the quality of these reasoning chains remains underexplored. We present a comprehensive empirical study examining the reasoning process and quality of thinking LLMs for code generation. We evaluate six state-of-the-art reasoning LLMs (DeepSeek-R1, OpenAI-o3-mini, Claude-3.7-Sonnet-Thinking, Gemini-2.0-Flash-Thinking, Gemini-2.5-Flash, and Qwen-QwQ) across 100 code generation tasks of varying difficulty from BigCodeBench. We quantify reasoning-chain structure through step counts and verbosity, conduct controlled step-budget adjustments, and perform a 21-participant human evaluation across three dimensions: efficiency, logical correctness, and completeness. Our step-count interventions reveal that targeted step increases can improve resolution rates for certain models/tasks, while modest reductions often preserve success on standard tasks, rarely on hard ones. Through systematic analysis, we develop a reasoning-problematic taxonomy, identifying completeness as the dominant failure mode. Task complexity significantly impacts reasoning quality; hard problems are substantially more prone to incompleteness than standard tasks. Our stability analysis demonstrates that thinking LLMs maintain consistent logical structures across computational effort levels and can self-correct previous errors. This study provides new insights into the strengths and limitations of current thinking LLMs in software engineering.</p></details> |  |

However, accurately resolving indirect call targets remains a longstanding challenge in maintaining the integrity of static analysis in binary code. This difficulty arises because the operand of a call instruction (e.g., call rax) remains unknown until runtime, resulting in an incomplete inter-procedural control flow graph (CFG). Previous approaches have struggled with low accuracy and limited scalability. To address these limitations, recent work has increasingly turned to machine learning (ML) to enhance analysis. However, this ML-driven approach faces two significant obstacles: low-quality callsite-callee training pairs and inadequate binary code representation, both of which undermine the accuracy of ML models. In this paper, we introduce CupidCall, a novel approach for resolving indirect calls using graph neural networks. Existing ML models in this area often overlook key elements such as data and code cross-references, which are essential for understanding a program's control flow. In contrast, CupidCall augments CFGs with cross-references, preserving rich semantic information. Additionally, we leverage advanced compiler-level type analysis to generate high-quality callsite-callee training pairs, enhancing model precision and reliability. We further design a graph neural model that leverages augmented CFGs and relational graph convolutions for accurate target prediction. Evaluated against real-world binaries from GitHub and the Arch User Repository on x86_64 architecture, CupidCall achieves an F1 score of 95.2%, outperforming state-of-the-art ML-based approaches. These results highlight CupidCall's effectiveness in building precise inter-procedural CFGs and its potential to advance downstream binary analysis and security applications.</p></details> |  |
| **[Training-Free Adaptive Quantization for Variable Rate Image Coding for Machines](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05836v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Image Coding for Machines (ICM) has become increasingly important with the rapid integration of computer vision into real-world applications. However, most ICM frameworks utilize learned image compression (LIC) models that operate at a fixed rate and require separate training for each target bitrate, which may limit their practical applications. Existing variable rate LIC approaches mitigate this limitation but typically depend on training, increasing computational cost and deployment complexity. Moreover, variable rate control has not been thoroughly explored for ICM. To address these challenges, we propose a training-free, adaptive quantization step size control scheme that enables flexible bitrate adjustment. By leveraging both channel-wise entropy dependencies and spatial scale parameters predicted by the hyperprior network, the proposed method preserves semantically important regions while coarsely quantizing less critical areas. The bitrate can be continuously controlled through a single parameter. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving up to 11.07% BD-rate savings over the non-adaptive variable rate method.</p></details> |  |

The system supports a variety of programming languages, integrates debugging tasks and data acquisition functions, captures students' debugging behavior in the local editor in real time, and uploads the data to the platform database to realize the whole process monitoring and feedback, provides accurate debugging guidance for teachers, and improves the teaching effect. In terms of data analysis, the system proposed a debugging behavior analysis model based on abstract syntax tree, combined with node annotation, sequence recognition and cluster analysis and other technologies, to automatically track the context of students' debugging process and accurately identify key features in the debugging path. Through this tool, the system realizes the intelligent identification and labeling of the debugging direction and behavior pattern, and improves the refinement level of debugging data analysis. In this research system, a complex debugging scenario of multi-file and multi-task is introduced into the debugging problem design, which optimizes the multi-dimensional capturing ability of debugging data and lays a foundation for accurate debugging behavior analysis. Through several practical teaching tests, the feasibility and stability of the system are verified, which proves that it can effectively support procedural evaluation in programming debugging teaching, and provides a new direction for debugging behavior analysis research.</p></details> |  |

Developers often write low-quality code due to factors like technical knowledge gaps, insufficient experience, time pressure, management decisions, or personal factors. Once integrated, the accumulation of this suboptimal code leads to significant maintenance costs and technical debt. Developers frequently consult external knowledge bases, such as API documentation and Q&A websites like Stack Overflow (SO), to aid their programming tasks. SO's crowdsourced, collaborative nature has created a vast repository of programming knowledge. Its community-curated content is constantly evolving, with new answers posted or existing ones edited. In this paper, we present an empirical study of SO Java answer edits and their application to improving code in open-source projects. We use a modified code clone search tool to analyze SO code snippets with version history and apply it to open-source Java projects. This identifies outdated or unoptimized code and suggests improved alternatives. Analyzing 140,840 Java accepted answers from SOTorrent and 10,668 GitHub Java projects, we manually categorized SO answer edits and created pull requests to open-source projects with the suggested code improvements. Our results show that 6.91% of SO Java accepted answers have more than one revision (average of 2.82). Moreover, 49.24% of the code snippets in the answer edits are applicable to open-source projects, and 11 out of 36 proposed bug fixes based on these edits were accepted by the GitHub project maintainers.</p></details> |  |

These applications require understanding beyond surface-level code patterns: value propagation, control flow, and interdependence between program elements. However, existing benchmarks primarily evaluate end-to-end outcomes, such as whether code is correctly repaired or generated, leaving the models' ability for program semantic reasoning underexplored. This work presents CORE, a high-quality, human-verified benchmark designed to evaluate LLMs on fundamental static analysis tasks. CORE includes 12,553 task instances spanning data dependency, control dependency, and information flow across programs written in C/C++, Java, and Python. To ensure semantic diversity and reasoning complexity, we propose a semantics-aware diverse sampling strategy that selects targets and task instances based on structural coverage and dependency depth. We evaluate 10 mainstream LLMs and show that, while they perform well at identifying dependencies, models still struggle with tasks that require deeper semantic understanding and multi-step reasoning. We further conduct qualitative analyses to uncover key challenges, such as complex control structures and backward dependency patterns, offering insights into improving LLMs' code reasoning capabilities.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 Datasets & Benchmarks Spotlight</p></details> |

To address these challenges, recent research has increasingly explored knowledge distillation as a method for compressing a large language model of code (the teacher) into a smaller model (the student) while maintaining performance. However, the degree to which a student model deeply mimics the predictive behavior and internal representations of its teacher remains largely unexplored, as current accuracy-based evaluation provides only a surface-level view of model quality and often fails to capture more profound discrepancies in behavioral fidelity between the teacher and student models. To address this gap, we empirically show that the student model often fails to deeply mimic the teacher model, resulting in up to 285% greater performance drop under adversarial attacks, which is not captured by traditional accuracy-based evaluation. Therefore, we propose MetaCompress, a metamorphic testing framework that systematically evaluates behavioral fidelity by comparing the outputs of teacher and student models under a set of behavior-preserving metamorphic relations. We evaluate MetaCompress on two widely studied tasks, using compressed versions of popular language models of code, obtained via three different knowledge distillation techniques: Compressor, AVATAR, and MORPH. The results show that MetaCompress identifies up to 62% behavioral discrepancies in student models, underscoring the need for behavioral fidelity evaluation within the knowledge distillation pipeline and establishing MetaCompress as a practical framework for testing compressed language models of code derived through knowledge distillation.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper is currently under review at a peer-reviewed journal</p></details> |

| **[Querying Labeled Time Series Data with Scenario Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10627v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Simulation-based testing has become a crucial complement to road testing for ensuring the safety of cyber physical systems (CPS). As a result, significant research efforts have been directed toward identifying failure scenarios within simulation environments. However, a critical question remains. Are the AV failure scenarios discovered in simulation reproducible on actual systems in the real world? The sim-to-real gap caused by differences between simulated and real sensor data means that failure scenarios identified in simulation might either be artifacts of synthetic sensor data or actual issues that also occur with real sensor data. To address this, an effective approach to validating simulated failure scenarios is to locate occurrences of these scenarios within real-world datasets and verify whether the failure persists on the datasets. To this end, we introduce a formal definition of how labeled time series sensor data can match an abstract scenario, represented as a scenario program using the Scenic probabilistic programming language. We present a querying algorithm that, given a scenario program and a labeled dataset, identifies the subset of data that matches the specified scenario. Our experiment shows that our algorithm is more accurate and orders of magnitude faster in querying scenarios than the state-of-the-art commercial vision large language models, and can scale with the duration of queried time series data.</p></details> |  |
| **[Contextual Refinement of Higher-Order Concurrent Probabilistic Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.10135v1)** | 2025-11-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present Foxtrot, the first higher-order separation logic for proving contextual refinement of higher-order concurrent probabilistic programs with higher-order local state. From a high level, Foxtrot inherits various concurrency reasoning principles from standard concurrent separation logic, e.g. invariants and ghost resources, and supports advanced probabilistic reasoning principles for reasoning about complex probability distributions induced by concurrent threads, e.g. tape presampling and induction by error amplification. The integration of these strong reasoning principles is highly non-trivial due to the combination of probability and concurrency in the language and the complexity of the Foxtrot model; the soundness of the logic relies on a version of the axiom of choice within the Iris logic, which is not used in earlier work on Iris-based logics. We demonstrate the expressiveness of Foxtrot on a wide range of examples, including the adversarial von Neumann coin and the $\mathsf{randombytes\_uniform}$ function of the Sodium cryptography software library. All results have been mechanized in the Rocq proof assistant and the Iris separation logic framework.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging GPT-4o, Owlgorithm produces context-aware, metacognitive prompts tailored to individual student submissions. Integrated into a second- and third-year CP course, the system-provided reflective prompts adapted to student outcomes: guiding deeper conceptual insight for correct solutions and structured debugging for partial or failed ones. Our exploratory assessment of student ratings and TA feedback revealed both promising benefits and notable limitations. While many found the generated questions useful for reflection and debugging, concerns were raised about feedback accuracy and classroom usability. These results suggest advantages of LLM-supported reflection for novice programmers, though refinements are needed to ensure reliability and pedagogical value for advanced learners. From our experience, several key insights emerged: GenAI can effectively support structured reflection, but careful prompt design, dynamic adaptation, and usability improvements are critical to realizing their potential in education. We offer specific recommendations for educators using similar tools and outline next steps to enhance Owlgorithm's educational impact. The underlying framework may also generalize to other reflective learning contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 1 figure, to be published in SIGCSE '26</p></details> |
| **[SPADA: A Spatial Dataflow Architecture Programming Language](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09447v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Spatial dataflow architectures like the Cerebras Wafer-Scale Engine achieve exceptional performance in AI and scientific applications by leveraging distributed memory across processing elements (PEs) and localized computation. However, programming these architectures remains challenging due to the need for explicit orchestration of data movement through reconfigurable networks-on-chip and asynchronous computation triggered by data arrival. Existing FPGA and CGRA programming models emphasize loop scheduling but overlook the unique capabilities of spatial dataflow architectures, particularly efficient dataflow over regular grids and intricate routing management. We present SPADA, a programming language that provides precise control over data placement, dataflow patterns, and asynchronous operations while abstracting architecture-specific low-level details. We introduce a rigorous dataflow semantics framework for SPADA that defines routing correctness, data races, and deadlocks. Additionally, we design and implement a compiler targeting Cerebras CSL with multi-level lowering. SPADA serves as both a high-level programming interface and an intermediate representation for domain-specific languages (DSLs), which we demonstrate with the GT4Py stencil DSL. SPADA enables developers to express complex parallel patterns -- including pipelined reductions and multi-dimensional stencils -- in 6--8x less code than CSL with near-ideal weak scaling across three orders of magnitude. By unifying programming for spatial dataflow architectures under a single model, SPADA advances both the theoretical foundations and practical usability of these emerging high-performance computing platforms.</p></details> |  |

An adaptive feature program has recently been proposed to analyze the feature learning characteristic property of neural networks in a more abstract way. Motivated by the celebrated Le Cam equivalence, we advocate the over-parametrized sequence models to further simplify the analysis of the training dynamics of adaptive feature program and present several supporting evidences for the adaptive feature program. More precisely, after having introduced the feature error measure (FEM) to characterize the quality of the learned feature, we show that the FEM is decreasing during the training process of several concrete adaptive feature models including linear regression, single/multiple index models, etc. We believe that this hints at the potential successes of the adaptive feature program.</p></details> |  |
| **[Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming for d-dimensional Symbolic Regression Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.09416v1)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Transformer Semantic Genetic Programming (TSGP) is a semantic search approach that uses a pre-trained transformer model as a variation operator to generate offspring programs with controlled semantic similarity to a given parent. Unlike other semantic GP approaches that rely on fixed syntactic transformations, TSGP aims to learn diverse structural variations that lead to solutions with similar semantics. We find that a single transformer model trained on millions of programs is able to generalize across symbolic regression problems of varying dimension. Evaluated on 24 real-world and synthetic datasets, TSGP significantly outperforms standard GP, SLIM_GSGP, Deep Symbolic Regression, and Denoising Autoencoder GP, achieving an average rank of 1.58 across all benchmarks. Moreover, TSGP produces more compact solutions than SLIM_GSGP, despite its higher accuracy. In addition, the target semantic distance $\mathrm{SD}_t$ is able to control the step size in the semantic space: small values of $\mathrm{SD}_t$ enable consistent improvement in fitness but often lead to larger programs, while larger values promote faster convergence and compactness. Thus, $\mathrm{SD}_t$ provides an effective mechanism for balancing exploration and exploitation.</p></details> |  |
| **[ExDBN: Learning Dynamic Bayesian Networks using Extended Mixed-Integer Programming Formulations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.16100v3)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Causal learning from data has received much attention recently. Bayesian networks can be used to capture causal relationships. There, one recovers a weighted directed acyclic graph in which random variables are represented by vertices, and the weights associated with each edge represent the strengths of the causal relationships between them. This concept is extended to capture dynamic effects by introducing a dependency on past data, which may be captured by the structural equation model. This formalism is utilized in the present contribution to propose a score-based learning algorithm. A mixed-integer quadratic program is formulated and an algorithmic solution proposed, in which the pre-generation of exponentially many acyclicity constraints is avoided by utilizing the so-called branch-and-cut (``lazy constraint'') method. Comparing the novel approach to the state-of-the-art, we show that the proposed approach turns out to produce more accurate results when applied to small and medium-sized synthetic instances containing up to 80 time series. Lastly, two interesting applications in bioscience and finance, to which the method is directly applied, further stress the importance of developing highly accurate, globally convergent solvers that can handle instances of modest size.</p></details> | <details><summary>Code ...</summary><p>Code available at: https://github.com/pavelrt/ExDBN</p></details> |
| **[When AI Takes the Wheel: Security Analysis of Framework-Constrained Program Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16823v2)** | 2025-11-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In recent years, the AI wave has grown rapidly in software development. Even novice developers can now design and generate complex framework-constrained software systems based on their high-level requirements with the help of Large Language Models (LLMs). However, when LLMs gradually "take the wheel" of software development, developers may only check whether the program works. They often miss security problems hidden in how the generated programs are implemented. In this work, we investigate the security properties of framework-constrained programs generated by state-of-the-art LLMs. We focus specifically on Chrome extensions due to their complex security model involving multiple privilege boundaries and isolated components. To achieve this, we built ChromeSecBench, a dataset with 140 prompts based on known vulnerable extensions. We used these prompts to instruct nine state-of-the-art LLMs to generate complete Chrome extensions, and then analyzed them for vulnerabilities across three dimensions: scenario types, model differences, and vulnerability categories. Our results show that LLMs produced vulnerable programs at alarmingly high rates (18%-50%), particularly in Authentication & Identity and Cookie Management scenarios (up to 83% and 78% respectively). Most vulnerabilities exposed sensitive browser data like cookies, history, or bookmarks to untrusted code. Interestingly, we found that advanced reasoning models performed worse, generating more vulnerabilities than simpler models. These findings highlight a critical gap between LLMs' coding skills and their ability to write secure framework-constrained programs.</p></details> |  |

Existing taxonomies and tools remain fragmented, organized around symptoms such as reentrancy rather than structural causes. This paper introduces an attack-centric, program-structure taxonomy that unifies Solidity vulnerabilities into eight root-cause families covering control flow, external calls, state integrity, arithmetic safety, environmental dependencies, access control, input validation, and cross-domain protocol assumptions. Each family is illustrated through concise Solidity examples, exploit mechanics, and mitigations, and linked to the detection signals observable by static, dynamic, and learning-based tools. We further cross-map legacy datasets (SmartBugs, SolidiFI) to this taxonomy to reveal label drift and coverage gaps. The taxonomy provides a consistent vocabulary and practical checklist that enable more interpretable detection, reproducible audits, and structured security education for both researchers and practitioners.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 1 figure, 8 root-cause families</p></details> |

While logic inference on top of subsymbolic modules has been shown to effectively guarantee these properties, this often comes at the cost of reduced scalability, which can severely limit the usability of NeSy models. This paper introduces DeepProofLog (DPrL), a novel NeSy system based on stochastic logic programs, which addresses the scalability limitations of previous methods. DPrL parameterizes all derivation steps with neural networks, allowing efficient neural guidance over the proving system. Additionally, we establish a formal mapping between the resolution process of our deep stochastic logic programs and Markov Decision Processes, enabling the application of dynamic programming and reinforcement learning techniques for efficient inference and learning. This theoretical connection improves scalability for complex proof spaces and large knowledge bases. Our experiments on standard NeSy benchmarks and knowledge graph reasoning tasks demonstrate that DPrL outperforms existing state-of-the-art NeSy systems, advancing scalability to larger and more complex settings than previously possible.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AAAI 2026</p></details> |

Recently, Sakaue and Oki proposed a data-driven approach for linear programs (LPs), where the projection matrix is learned from observed problem instances drawn from an application-specific distribution of problems. We analyze the generalization guarantee for the data-driven projection matrix learning for convex quadratic programs (QPs). Unlike in LPs, the optimal solutions of convex QPs are not confined to the vertices of the feasible polyhedron, and this complicates the analysis of the optimal value function. To overcome this challenge, we demonstrate that the solutions of convex QPs can be localized within a feasible region corresponding to a special active set, utilizing Caratheodory's theorem. Building on such observation, we propose the unrolled active set method, which models the computation of the optimal value as a Goldberg-Jerrum (GJ) algorithm with bounded complexities, thereby establishing learning guarantees. We then further extend our analysis to other settings, including learning to match the optimal solution and input-aware setting, where we learn a mapping from QP problem instances to projection matrices.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Streaming Tensor Program: A streaming abstraction for dynamic parallelism](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07776v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Dynamic behaviors are becoming prevalent in many tensor applications. In machine learning, for example, the input tensors are dynamically shaped or ragged, and data-dependent control flow is widely used in many models. However, the limited expressiveness of prior programming abstractions for spatial dataflow accelerators forces the dynamic behaviors to be implemented statically or lacks the visibility for performance-critical decisions. To address these challenges, we present the Streaming Tensor Program (STeP), a new streaming abstraction that enables dynamic tensor workloads to run efficiently on spatial dataflow accelerators. STeP introduces flexible routing operators, an explicit memory hierarchy, and symbolic shape semantics that expose dynamic data rates and tensor dimensions. These capabilities unlock new optimizations-dynamic tiling, dynamic parallelization, and configuration time-multiplexing-that adapt to dynamic behaviors while preserving dataflow efficiency. Using a cycle-approximate simulator on representative LLM layers with real-world traces, dynamic tiling reduces on-chip memory requirement by 2.18x, dynamic parallelization improves latency by 1.5x, and configuration time-multiplexing improves compute utilization by 2.57x over implementations available in prior abstractions.</p></details> |  |
| **[Linear Programming Hierarchies Collapse under Symmetry](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.07766v1)** | 2025-11-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The presence of symmetries is one of the central structural features that make some integer programs challenging for state-of-the-art solvers. In this work, we study the efficacy of Linear Programming (LP) hierarchies in the presence of symmetries. Our main theorem unveils a connection between the algebraic structure of these relaxations and the geometry of the initial integer-empty polytope: We show that under $(k+1)$-transitive symmetries--a measure of the underlying symmetry in the problem--the corresponding relaxation at level $k$ of the hierarchy is non-empty if and only if the initial polytope intersects all $(n-k)$-dimensional faces of the hypercube. In particular, the hierarchies of Sherali-Adams, Lovász-Schrijver, and the Lift-and-Project closure are equally effective at detecting integer emptiness. Our result provides a unifying, group-theoretic characterization of the poor performance of LP-based hierarchies, and offers a simple procedure for proving lower bounds on the integrality gaps of symmetric polytopes under these hierarchies.</p></details> |  |

While AI-based systems offer scalable and immediate help, their responses can occasionally be inaccurate or insufficient. Human instructors, in contrast, may bring more valuable expertise but are limited in time and availability. To address these limitations, we present a hybrid help framework that integrates AI-generated hints with an escalation mechanism, allowing students to request feedback from instructors when AI support falls short. This design leverages the strengths of AI for scale and responsiveness while reserving instructor effort for moments of greatest need. We deployed this tool in a data science programming course with 82 students. We observe that out of the total 673 AI-generated hints, students rated 146 (22%) as unhelpful. Among those, only 16 (11%) of the cases were escalated to the instructors. A qualitative investigation of instructor responses showed that those feedback instances were incorrect or insufficient roughly half of the time. This finding suggests that when AI support fails, even instructors with expertise may need to pay greater attention to avoid making mistakes. We will publicly release the tool for broader adoption and enable further studies in other classrooms. Our work contributes a practical approach to scaling high-quality support and informs future efforts to effectively integrate AI and humans in education.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of the SIGCSE'26 paper</p></details> |
| **[Disciplined Biconvex Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01813v2)** | 2025-11-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce disciplined biconvex programming (DBCP), a modeling framework for specifying and solving biconvex optimization problems. Biconvex optimization problems arise in various applications, including machine learning, signal processing, computational science, and control. Solving a biconvex optimization problem in practice usually resolves to heuristic methods based on alternate convex search (ACS), which iteratively optimizes over one block of variables while keeping the other fixed, so that the resulting subproblems are convex and can be efficiently solved. However, designing and implementing an ACS solver for a specific biconvex optimization problem usually requires significant effort from the user, which can be tedious and error-prone. DBCP extends the principles of disciplined convex programming to biconvex problems, allowing users to specify biconvex optimization problems in a natural way based on a small number of syntax rules. The resulting problem can then be automatically split and transformed into convex subproblems, for which a customized ACS solver is then generated and applied. DBCP allows users to quickly experiment with different biconvex problem formulations, without expertise in convex optimization. We implement DBCP into the open source Python package dbcp, as an extension to the famous domain specific language CVXPY for convex optimization.</p></details> |  |

We investigate whether multimodal AI systems possess this capability through FractalBench, a benchmark evaluating fractal program synthesis from images. Fractals provide ideal test cases: Iterated Function Systems with only a few contraction maps generate complex self-similar patterns through simple recursive rules, requiring models to bridge visual perception with mathematical abstraction. We evaluate four leading MLLMs -- GPT-4o, Claude 3.7 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Flash, and Qwen 2.5-VL -- on 12 canonical fractals. Models must generate executable Python code reproducing the fractal, enabling objective evaluation. Results reveal a striking disconnect: 76% generate syntactically valid code but only 4% capture mathematical structure. Success varies systematically -- models handle geometric transformations (Koch curves: 17-21%) but fail at branching recursion (trees: <2%), revealing fundamental gaps in mathematical abstraction.

| **[Hope, Aspirations, and the Impact of LLMs on Female Programming Learners in Afghanistan](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.08630v1)** | 2025-11-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Designing impactful educational technologies in contexts of socio-political instability requires a nuanced understanding of educational aspirations. Currently, scalable metrics for measuring aspirations are limited. This study adapts, translates, and evaluates Snyder's Hope Scale as a metric for measuring aspirations among 136 women learning programming online during a period of systemic educational restrictions in Afghanistan. The adapted scale demonstrated good reliability (Cronbach's α = 0.78) and participants rated it as understandable and relevant. While overall aspiration-related scores did not differ significantly by access to Large Language Models (LLMs), those with access reported marginally higher scores on the Avenues subscale (p = .056), suggesting broader perceived pathways to achieving educational aspirations. These findings support the use of the adapted scale as a metric for aspirations in contexts of socio-political instability. More broadly, the adapted scale can be used to evaluate the impact of aspiration-driven design of educational technologies.</p></details> |  |
| **[Design and Implementation of Data Acquisition and Analysis System for Programming Debugging Process Based On VS Code Plug-In](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05825v1)** | 2025-11-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In order to meet the needs of students' programming debugging ability training, this paper designs and implements a data acquisition and analysis system for programming debugging process based on VS Code plug-in, which aims to solve the limitation of traditional assessment methods that are difficult to fully evaluate students' debugging ability. The system supports a variety of programming languages, integrates debugging tasks and data acquisition functions, captures students' debugging behavior in the local editor in real time, and uploads the data to the platform database to realize the whole process monitoring and feedback, provides accurate debugging guidance for teachers, and improves the teaching effect. In terms of data analysis, the system proposed a debugging behavior analysis model based on abstract syntax tree, combined with node annotation, sequence recognition and cluster analysis and other technologies, to automatically track the context of students' debugging process and accurately identify key features in the debugging path. Through this tool, the system realizes the intelligent identification and labeling of the debugging direction and behavior pattern, and improves the refinement level of debugging data analysis. In this research system, a complex debugging scenario of multi-file and multi-task is introduced into the debugging problem design, which optimizes the multi-dimensional capturing ability of debugging data and lays a foundation for accurate debugging behavior analysis. Through several practical teaching tests, the feasibility and stability of the system are verified, which proves that it can effectively support procedural evaluation in programming debugging teaching, and provides a new direction for debugging behavior analysis research.</p></details> |  |
| **[UA-Code-Bench: A Competitive Programming Benchmark for Evaluating LLM Code Generation in Ukrainian](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.05040v1)** | 2025-11-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Evaluating the real capabilities of large language models in low-resource languages still represents a challenge, as many existing benchmarks focus on widespread tasks translated from English or evaluate only simple language understanding. This paper introduces UA-Code-Bench, a new open-source benchmark established for a thorough evaluation of language models' code generation and competitive programming problem-solving abilities in Ukrainian. The benchmark comprises 500 problems from the Eolymp platform, evenly distributed across five complexity levels from very easy to very hard. A diverse set of 13 leading proprietary and open-source models, generating Python solutions based on a one-shot prompt, was evaluated via the dedicated Eolymp environment against hidden tests, ensuring code correctness. The obtained results reveal that even top-performing models, such as OpenAI o3 and GPT-5, solve only half of the problems, highlighting the challenge of code generation in low-resource natural language. Furthermore, this research presents a comprehensive analysis of performance across various difficulty levels, as well as an assessment of solution uniqueness and computational efficiency, measured by both elapsed time and memory consumption of the generated solutions. In conclusion, this work demonstrates the value of competitive programming benchmarks in evaluating large language models, especially in underrepresented languages. It also paves the way for future research on multilingual code generation and reasoning-enhanced models. The benchmark, data parsing, preparation, code generation, and evaluation scripts are available at https://huggingface.co/datasets/NLPForUA/ua-code-bench.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 5 figures.

| **[APRMCTS: Improving LLM-based Automated Program Repair with Iterative Tree Search](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01827v3)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) attempts to fix software bugs without human intervention, which plays a crucial role in software development and maintenance. Recently, with the advances in Large Language Models (LLMs), a rapidly increasing number of APR techniques have been proposed with remarkable performance. However, existing LLM-based APR techniques typically adopt trial-and-error strategies, which suffer from two major drawbacks: (1) inherently limited patch effectiveness due to local exploration, and (2) low search efficiency due to redundant exploration. In this paper, we propose APRMCTS, which uses iterative tree search to improve LLM-based APR. APRMCTS incorporates Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) into patch searching by performing a global evaluation of the explored patches and selecting the most promising one for subsequent refinement and generation. APRMCTS effectively resolves the problems of falling into local optima and thus helps improve the efficiency of patch searching. Our experiments on 835 bugs from Defects4J demonstrate that, when integrated with GPT-3.5, APRMCTS can fix a total of 201 bugs, which outperforms all state-of-the-art baselines. Besides, APRMCTS helps GPT-4o-mini, GPT-3.5, Yi-Coder-9B, and Qwen2.5-Coder-7B to fix 30, 27, 37, and 28 more bugs, respectively. More importantly, APRMCTS boasts a significant performance advantage while employing small patch size (16 and 32), notably fewer than the 500 and 10,000 patches adopted in previous studies. In terms of cost, compared to existing state-of-the-art LLM-based APR methods, APRMCTS has time and monetary costs of less than 20% and 50%, respectively. Our extensive study demonstrates that APRMCTS exhibits good effectiveness and efficiency, with particular advantages in addressing complex bugs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Scaffolding Metacognition in Programming Education: Understanding Student-AI Interactions and Design Implications](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.04144v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT now provide novice programmers with unprecedented access to instant, personalized support. While this holds clear promise, their influence on students' metacognitive processes remains underexplored. Existing work has largely focused on correctness and usability, with limited attention to whether and how students' use of AI assistants supports or bypasses key metacognitive processes. This study addresses that gap by analyzing student-AI interactions through a metacognitive lens in university-level programming courses. We examined more than 10,000 dialogue logs collected over three years, complemented by surveys of students and educators. Our analysis focused on how prompts and responses aligned with metacognitive phases and strategies. Synthesizing these findings across data sources, we distill design considerations for AI-powered coding assistants that aim to support rather than supplant metacognitive engagement. Our findings provide guidance for developing educational AI tools that strengthen students' learning processes in programming education.</p></details> |  |
| **[Collaborative Agents for Automated Program Repair in Ruby](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03925v1)** | 2025-11-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated Program Repair (APR) has advanced rapidly with Large Language Models (LLMs), but most existing methods remain computationally expensive, and focused on a small set of languages. Ruby, despite its widespread use in web development and the persistent challenges faced by its developers, has received little attention in APR research. In this paper, we introduce RAMP, a novel lightweight framework that formulates program repair as a feedback-driven, iterative process for Ruby. RAMP employs a team of collaborative agents that generate targeted tests, reflect on errors, and refine candidate fixes until a correct solution is found. Unlike prior approaches, RAMP is designed to avoid reliance on large multilingual repair databases or costly fine-tuning, instead operating directly on Ruby through lightweight prompting and test-driven feedback. Evaluation on the XCodeEval benchmark shows that RAMP achieves a pass@1 of 67% on Ruby, outper-forming prior approaches. RAMP converges quickly within five iterations, and ablation studies confirm that test generation and self-reflection are key drivers of its performance. Further analysis shows that RAMP is particularly effective at repairing wrong answers, compilation errors, and runtime errors. Our approach provides new insights into multi-agent repair strategies, and establishes a foundation for extending LLM-based debugging tools to under-studied languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[HAFixAgent: History-Aware Automated Program Repair Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01047v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) has recently shifted toward large language models and agent-based systems, yet most systems rely on local snapshot context, overlooking repository history. Prior work shows that repository history helps repair single-line bugs, since the last commit touching the buggy line is often the bug-introducing one. In this paper, we investigate whether repository history can also improve agentic APR systems at scale, especially for complex multi-hunk bugs. We present HAFixAgent, a History-Aware Bug-Fixing Agent that injects blame-derived repository heuristics into its repair loop. A preliminary study of all 854 real-world bugs from Defects4J motivates our design, showing that bug-relevant history is both widely available and highly concentrated. Empirical comparison of HAFixAgent with two state-of-the-art baselines shows: (1) Effectiveness: HAFixAgent significantly improves over the agent-based baseline (by 212.3%) and the multi-hunk baseline (by 29.9%). (2) Efficiency: history does not significantly increase agent steps and keeps token costs comparable, with notably lower median costs for complex multi-file-multi-hunk bugs. (3) Practicality: combining different historical heuristics repairs more bugs, offering a clear cost-benefit trade-off. HAFixAgent offers a practical recipe for history-aware agentic APR: ground the agent in version control history, prioritize diff-based historical context, and integrate complementary heuristics when needed.</p></details> | 31 pages, 6 figures |
| **[Fast weight programming and linear transformers: from machine learning to neurobiology](https://arxiv.org/abs/2508.08435v2)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in artificial neural networks for machine learning, and language modeling in particular, have established a family of recurrent neural network (RNN) architectures that, unlike conventional RNNs with vector-form hidden states, use two-dimensional (2D) matrix-form hidden states. Such 2D-state RNNs, known as Fast Weight Programmers (FWPs), can be interpreted as a neural network whose synaptic weights (called fast weights) dynamically change over time as a function of input observations, and serve as short-term memory storage; corresponding synaptic weight modifications are controlled or programmed by another network (the programmer) whose parameters are trained (e.g., by gradient descent). In this Primer, we review the technical foundations of FWPs, their computational characteristics, and their connections to transformers and state space models. We also discuss connections between FWPs and models of synaptic plasticity in the brain, suggesting a convergence of natural and artificial intelligence.</p></details> |  |
| **[Randomized Rounding over Dynamic Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03490v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We show that under mild assumptions for a problem whose solutions admit a dynamic programming-like recurrence relation, we can still find a solution under additional packing constraints, which need to be satisfied approximately. The number of additional constraints can be very large, for example, polynomial in the problem size. Technically, we reinterpret the dynamic programming subproblems and their solutions as a network design problem. Inspired by techniques from, for example, the Directed Steiner Tree problem, we construct a strong LP relaxation, on which we then apply randomized rounding. Our approximation guarantees on the packing constraints have roughly the form of a $(n^ε \mathrm{polylog}\ n)$-approximation in time $n^{O(1/ε)}$, for any $ε> 0$. By setting $ε=\log \log n/\log n$, we obtain a polylogarithmic approximation in quasi-polynomial time, or by setting $ε$ as a constant, an $n^ε$-approximation in polynomial time. While there are necessary assumptions on the form of the DP, it is general enough to capture many textbook dynamic programs from Shortest Path to Longest Common Subsequence. Our algorithm then implies that we can impose additional constraints on the solutions to these problems. This allows us to model various problems from the literature in approximation algorithms, many of which were not thought to be connected to dynamic programming. In fact, our result can even be applied indirectly to some problems that involve covering instead of packing constraints, for example, the Directed Steiner Tree problem, or those that do not directly follow a recurrence relation, for example, variants of the Matching problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hesse's Redemption: Efficient Convex Polynomial Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03440v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficient algorithms for convex optimization, such as the ellipsoid method, require an a priori bound on the radius of a ball around the origin guaranteed to contain an optimal solution if one exists. For linear and convex quadratic programming, such solution bounds follow from classical characterizations of optimal solutions by systems of linear equations. For other programs, e.g., semidefinite ones, examples due to Khachiyan show that optimal solutions may require huge coefficients with an exponential number of bits, even if we allow approximations. Correspondingly, semidefinite programming is not even known to be in NP. The unconstrained minimization of convex polynomials of degree four and higher has remained a fundamental open problem between these two extremes: its optimal solutions do not admit a linear characterization and, at the same time, Khachiyan-type examples do not apply. We resolve this problem by developing new techniques to prove solution bounds when no linear characterizations are available. Even for programs minimizing a convex polynomial (of arbitrary degree) over a polyhedron, we prove that the existence of an optimal solution implies that an approximately optimal one with polynomial bit length also exists. These solution bounds, combined with the ellipsoid method, yield the first polynomial-time algorithm for convex polynomial programming, settling a question posed by Nesterov (Math. Program., 2019). Before, no polynomial-time algorithm was known even for unconstrained minimization of a convex polynomial of degree four.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimal Boundary Control of Diffusion on Graphs via Linear Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.03129v1)** | 2025-11-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a linear programming (LP) framework for steady-state diffusion and flux optimization on geometric networks. The state variable satisfies a discrete diffusion law on a weighted, oriented graph, where conductances are scaled by edge lengths to preserve geometric fidelity. Boundary potentials act as controls that drive interior fluxes according to a linear network Laplacian. The optimization problem enforces physically meaningful sign and flux-cap constraints at all boundary edges, derived directly from a gradient bound. This yields a finite-dimensional LP whose feasible set is polyhedral, and whose boundedness and solvability follow from simple geometric or algebraic conditions on the network data. We prove that under the absence of negative recession directions--automatically satisfied in the presence of finite box bounds, flux caps, or sign restrictions--the LP admits a global minimizer. Several sufficient conditions guaranteeing boundedness of the feasible region are identified, covering both full-rank and rank-deficient flux maps. The analysis connects classical results such as the Minkowski--Weyl decomposition, Hoffman's bound, and the fundamental theorem of linear programming with modern network-based diffusion modeling. Two large-scale examples illustrate the framework: (i) A typical large stadium in a major modern city, which forms a single connected component with relatively uniform corridor widths, and a (ii) A complex street network emanating from a large, historical city center, which forms a multi-component system.</p></details> |  |
| **[Comprehension-Performance Gap in GenAI-Assisted Brownfield Programming: A Replication and Extension](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02922v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code comprehension is essential for brownfield programming tasks, in which developers maintain and enhance legacy code bases. Generative AI (GenAI) coding assistants such as GitHub Copilot have been shown to improve developer productivity, but their impact on code understanding is less clear. We replicate and extend a previous study by exploring both performance and comprehension in GenAI-assisted brownfield programming tasks. In a within-subjects experimental study, 18 computer science graduate students completed feature implementation tasks with and without Copilot. Results show that Copilot significantly reduced task time and increased the number of test cases passed. However, comprehension scores did not differ across conditions, revealing a comprehension-performance gap: participants passed more test cases with Copilot, but did not demonstrate greater understanding of the legacy codebase. Moreover, we failed to find a correlation between comprehension and task performance. These findings suggest that while GenAI tools can accelerate programming progress in a legacy codebase, such progress may come without an improved understanding of that codebase. We consider the implications of these findings for programming education and GenAI tool design.</p></details> | 12 pages |
| **[Program Synthesis Dialog Agents for Interactive Decision-Making](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.19610v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many real-world eligibility problems, ranging from medical diagnosis to tax planning, can be mapped to decision problems expressed in natural language, wherein a model must make a binary choice based on user features. Large-scale domains such as legal codes or frequently updated funding opportunities render human annotation (e.g., web forms or decision trees) impractical, highlighting the need for agents that can automatically assist in decision-making. Since relevant information is often only known to the user, it is crucial that these agents ask the right questions. As agents determine when to terminate a conversation, they face a trade-off between accuracy and the number of questions asked, a key metric for both user experience and cost. To evaluate this task, we propose BeNYfits, a new benchmark for determining user eligibility for multiple overlapping social benefits opportunities through interactive decision-making. Our experiments show that current language models struggle with frequent hallucinations, with GPT-4o scoring only 35.7 F1 using a ReAct-style chain-of-thought. To address this, we introduce ProADA, a novel approach that leverages program synthesis to assist in decision-making by mapping dialog planning to a code generation problem and using gaps in structured data to determine the best next action. Our agent, ProADA, improves the F1 score to 55.6 while maintaining nearly the same number of dialog turns.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performance Evaluation of Bitstring Representations in a Linear Genetic Programming Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02897v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Different bitstring representations can yield varying computational performance. This work compares three bitstring implementations in C++: std::bitset, boost::dynamic_bitset, and a custom direct implementation. Their performance is benchmarked in the context of concatenation within a Linear Genetic Programming system. Benchmarks were conducted on three platforms (macOS, Linux, and Windows MSYS2) to assess platform specific performance variations. The results show that the custom direct implementation delivers the fastest performance on Linux and Windows, while std::bitset performs best on macOS. Although consistently slower, boost::dynamic_bitset remains a viable and flexible option. These findings highlight the influence of compiler optimisations and system architecture on performance, providing practical guidance for selecting the optimal method based on platform and application requirements.</p></details> |  |
| **[Application of the Lovász-Schrijver Lift-and-Project Operator to Compact Stable Set Integer Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.19290v3)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Lovász theta function $θ(G)$ provides a very good upper bound on the stability number of a graph $G$. It can be computed in polynomial time by solving a semidefinite program (SDP), which also turns out to be fairly tractable in practice. Consequently, $θ(G)$ achieves a hard-to-beat trade-off between computational effort and strength of the bound. Indeed, several attempts to improve the theta bound are documented, mainly based on playing around the application of the $N_+(\cdot)$ lifting operator of Lovász and Schrijver to the classical formulation of the maximum stable set problem. Experience shows that solving such SDP-s often struggles against practical intractability and requires highly specialized methods. We investigate the application of such an operator to two different linear formulations based on clique and nodal inequalities, respectively. Fewer inequalities describe these two and yet guarantee that the resulting SDP bound is at least as strong as $θ(G)$. Our computational experience, including larger graphs than those previously documented, shows that upper bounds stronger than $θ(G)$ can be accessed by a reasonable additional effort using the clique-based formulation on sparse graphs and the nodal-based one on dense graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Accelerating Graph Similarity Search through Integer Linear Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.02611v1)** | 2025-11-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Graph Edit Distance (GED) is an important metric for measuring the similarity between two (labeled) graphs. It is defined as the minimum cost required to convert one graph into another through a series of (elementary) edit operations. Its effectiveness in assessing the similarity of large graphs is limited by the complexity of its exact calculation, which is NP-hard theoretically and computationally challenging in practice. The latter can be mitigated by switching to the Graph Similarity Search under GED constraints, which determines whether the edit distance between two graphs is below a given threshold. A popular framework for solving Graph Similarity Search under GED constraints in a graph database for a query graph is the filter-and-verification framework. Filtering discards unpromising graphs, while the verification step certifies the similarity between the filtered graphs and the query graph. To improve the filtering step, we define a lower bound based on an integer linear programming formulation. We prove that this lower bound dominates the effective branch match-based lower bound and can also be computed efficiently. Consequently, we propose a graph similarity search algorithm that uses a hierarchy of lower bound algorithms and solves a novel integer programming formulation that exploits the threshold parameter. An extensive computational experience on a well-assessed test bed shows that our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art algorithm on most of the examined thresholds.</p></details> |  |

The critical seed chaining step must connect exact k-mer matches between reads and reference genomes while filtering spurious matches, yet state-of-the-art methods rely on fixed gap penalty functions unable to adapt to varying genomic contexts including tandem repeats and structural variants. This paper presents RawHash3, a hybrid framework combining graph neural networks with classical dynamic programming for adaptive seed chaining that maintains real-time performance while providing statistical guarantees. We formalize seed chaining as graph learning where seeds constitute nodes with 12-dimensional feature vectors and edges encode 8-dimensional spatial relationships including gap consistency. Our architecture employs three-layer EdgeConv GNN with confidence-based method selection that dynamically switches between learned guidance and algorithmic fallback. Comprehensive evaluation on 1,000 synthetic nanopore reads with 5,200 test seeds demonstrates RawHash3 achieves 99.94 percent precision and 40.07 percent recall, representing statistically significant 25.0 percent relative improvement over baseline with p less than 0.001. The system maintains median inference latency of 1.59ms meeting real-time constraints, while demonstrating superior robustness with 100 percent success rate under 20 percent label corruption versus baseline degradation to 30.3 percent.

We propose a low-cost visual program distillation method that can be used for models with at most 1 billion parameters and requires no human-generated program annotations. We achieve this through synthetic data augmentation based on decoupling programs into higher-level skills, called templates, and their corresponding arguments. Experimental results show that, with a relatively small amount of question/answer data, small language models can generate high-quality specialized visual programs with the added benefit of much faster inference</p></details> | EMNLP Camera Ready |

CFP is an intuitionistic first-order logic with inductive and coinductive definitions extended by two propositional operators: Restriction (binary), a strengthening of implication, and a unary operator for total concurrency. The source of the extraction are formal CFP proofs, the target is a lambda calculus with constructors and recursion extended by a constructor Amb (for McCarthy's amb) which is interpreted operationally as globally angelic choice and is used to implement nondeterminism and concurrency. The correctness of extracted programs is proven via an intermediate domain-theoretic denotational semantics. We demonstrate the usefulness of our system by extracting a nondeterministic program that translates infinite Gray code into the signed digit representation. A noteworthy feature of CFP is the fact that the proof rules for restriction and concurrency involve variants of the classical law of excluded middle that would not be interpretable computationally without Amb.This is a revised and extended version of the conference paper presented at ESOP 2022 with the same title that contains full proofs of all major results.</p></details> | <details><summary>39 pa...</summary><p>39 pages + 4 pages appendix. arXiv admin note: text overlap with arXiv:2104.14669</p></details> |

Conditional literals are one such construct. They form "subformulas" that behave as nested implications within the bodies of logic rules. Their inclusion brings the form of rules closer to the less restrictive syntax of first-order logic. These qualities make conditional literals useful tools for knowledge representation. In this paper, we propose a semantics for logic programs with conditional literals and arithmetic based on the SM operator. These semantics do not require grounding, unlike the established semantics for such programs that relies on a translation to infinitary propositional logic. The main result of this paper establishes the precise correspondence between the proposed and existing semantics.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version corrects the review of tau for negated atoms, and clarifies the distinction between global and local variables in conditional literals (the supporting proofs are also updated accordingly)</p></details> |

As a result, a mutation-alone $(1+λ)$ evolutionary strategy has become the canonical approach for CGP. Although several operators have been developed that demonstrate an increased performance over the canonical method, a general solution to the problem is still lacking. In this paper, we compare basic crossover methods, namely one-point and uniform, to variants in which nodes are ``preserved,'' including the subgraph crossover developed by Roman Kalkreuth, the difference being that when ``node preservation'' is active, crossover is not allowed to break apart instructions. We also compare a node mutation operator to the traditional point mutation; the former simply replaces an entire node with a new one. We find that node preservation in both mutation and crossover improves search using symbolic regression benchmark problems, moving the field towards a general solution to CGP crossover.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft to cite in another paper before both papers are peer-reviewed for the evo*2026 conference, 21 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

To aid debugging, program reduction techniques try to produce a smaller variant of the input program that still triggers the bug. However, existing execution-unaware program reduction techniques struggle with large and complex Wasm programs, because they rely on static information and apply syntactic transformations, while ignoring the valuable information offered by the input program's execution behavior. We present RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce, novel execution-aware program reduction techniques that leverage execution behaviors via record and replay. RR-Reduce identifies a bug-triggering function as the target function, isolates that function from the rest of the program, and generates a reduced program that replays only the interactions between the target function and the rest of the program. Hybrid-Reduce combines a complementary execution-unaware reduction technique with RR-Reduce to further reduce program size. We evaluate RR-Reduce and Hybrid-Reduce on 28 Wasm programs that trigger a diverse set of bugs in three engines. On average, RR-Reduce reduces the programs to 1.20 percent of their original size in 14.5 minutes, which outperforms the state of the art by 33.15 times in terms of reduction time. Hybrid-Reduce reduces the programs to 0.13 percent of their original size in 3.5 hours, which outperforms the state of the art by 3.42 times in terms of reduced program size and 2.26 times in terms of reduction time.

This dissertation optimizes human-AI programming roles through self-determination theory and personality psychology, introducing the Role Optimization Motivation Alignment (ROMA) framework. Through Design Science Research spanning five cycles, this work establishes empirically-validated connections between personality traits, programming role preferences, and collaborative outcomes, engaging 200 experimental participants and 46 interview respondents. Key findings demonstrate that personality-driven role optimization significantly enhances self-determination and team dynamics, yielding 23% average motivation increases among professionals and up to 65% among undergraduates. Five distinct personality archetypes emerge: The Explorer (high Openness/low Agreeableness), The Orchestrator (high Extraversion/Agreeableness), The Craftsperson (high Neuroticism/low Extraversion), The Architect (high Conscientiousness), and The Adapter (balanced profile). Each exhibits distinct preferences for programming roles (Co-Pilot, Co-Navigator, Agent), with assignment modes proving crucial for satisfaction. The dissertation contributes: (1) an empirically-validated framework linking personality traits to role preferences and self-determination outcomes; (2) a taxonomy of AI collaboration modalities mapped to personality profiles while preserving human agency; and (3) an ISO/IEC 29110 extension enabling Very Small Entities to implement personality-driven role optimization within established standards.

| **[Differentiation Through Black-Box Quadratic Programming Solvers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.06324v4)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Differentiable optimization has attracted significant research interest, particularly for quadratic programming (QP). Existing approaches for differentiating the solution of a QP with respect to its defining parameters often rely on specific integrated solvers. This integration limits their applicability, including their use in neural network architectures and bi-level optimization tasks, restricting users to a narrow selection of solver choices. To address this limitation, we introduce dQP, a modular and solver-agnostic framework for plug-and-play differentiation of virtually any QP solver. A key insight we leverage to achieve modularity is that, once the active set of inequality constraints is known, both the solution and its derivative can be expressed using simplified linear systems that share the same matrix. This formulation fully decouples the computation of the QP solution from its differentiation. Building on this result, we provide a minimal-overhead, open-source implementation ( https://github.com/cwmagoon/dQP ) that seamlessly integrates with over 15 state-of-the-art solvers. Comprehensive benchmark experiments demonstrate dQP's robustness and scalability, particularly highlighting its advantages in large-scale sparse problems.</p></details> |  |

Leveraging GPU acceleration enables exploration of larger search regions and faster iterations. A GPU-accelerated PDLP serves as an approximate LP solver, while a new probing cache facilitates rapid roundings and early infeasibility detection. Several state-of-the-art heuristics, including Feasibility Pump, Feasibility Jump, and Fix-and-Propagate, are further accelerated and enhanced. The combined approach of these GPU-driven algorithms yields significant improvements over existing methods, both in the number of feasible solutions and the quality of objectives by achieving 221 feasible solutions and 22% objective gap in the MIPLIB2017 benchmark on a presolved dataset.</p></details> |  |

We propose to prove satisfiability by building a tree automaton recognizing the Herbrand model of the CHCs. If such an automaton exists then the model is said to be regular, i.e., the Herbrand model is a regular set of atoms. Kostyukov et al. have shown how to derive an automaton when CVC4 finds a finite model of the CHCs. We propose an alternative way to build the automaton using an encoding into a SAT problem using Clingo, an Answer Set Programming (ASP) tool. We implemented a translation of CHCs with ADTs into an ASP problem. Combined with Clingo, we obtain a semi-complete satisfiability checker: it finds a tree automaton if a regular Herbrand model exists or finds a counter-example if the problem is unsatisfiable.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings HCVS 2025, arXiv:2510.25468</p></details> |

Conventional autograders, while efficient, act as black-box systems that simply return pass/fail results, offering little insight into student thinking or learning needs. Autograder+ is designed to shift autograding from a purely summative process to a formative learning experience. It introduces two key capabilities: automated feedback generation using a fine-tuned Large Language Model, and visualization of student code submissions to uncover learning patterns. The model is fine-tuned on curated student code and expert feedback to ensure pedagogically aligned, context-aware guidance. In evaluation across 600 student submissions from multiple programming tasks, the system produced feedback with strong semantic alignment to instructor comments. For visualization, contrastively learned code embeddings trained on 1,000 annotated submissions enable grouping solutions into meaningful clusters based on functionality and approach. The system also supports prompt-pooling, allowing instructors to guide feedback style through selected prompt templates. By integrating AI-driven feedback, semantic clustering, and interactive visualization, Autograder+ reduces instructor workload while supporting targeted instruction and promoting stronger learning outcomes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Runtime Repeated Recursion Unfolding in CHR: A Just-In-Time Online Program Optimization Strategy That Can Achieve Super-Linear Speedup](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.02180v5)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a just-in-time runtime program transformation strategy based on repeated recursion unfolding. Our online program optimization generates several versions of a recursion differentiated by the minimal number of recursive steps covered. The base case of the recursion is ignored in our technique. Our method is introduced here on the basis of single linear direct recursive rules. When a recursive call is encountered at runtime, first an unfolder creates specializations of the associated recursive rule on-the-fly and then an interpreter applies these rules to the call. Our approach reduces the number of recursive rule applications to its logarithm at the expense of introducing a logarithmic number of generic unfolded rules. We prove correctness of our online optimization technique and determine its time complexity. For recursions which have enough simplifyable unfoldings, a super-linear is possible, i.e. speedup by more than a constant factor. The necessary simplification is problem-specific and has to be provided at compile-time. In our speedup analysis, we prove a sufficient condition as well as a sufficient and necessary condition for super-linear speedup relating the complexity of the recursive steps of the original rule and the unfolded rules. We have implemented an unfolder and meta-interpreter for runtime repeated recursion unfolding with just five rules in Constraint Handling Rules (CHR) embedded in Prolog. We illustrate the feasibility of our approach with simplifications, time complexity results and benchmarks for some basic tractable algorithms. The simplifications require some insight and were derived manually. The runtime improvement quickly reaches several orders of magnitude, consistent with the super-linear speedup predicted by our theorems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Final...</summary><p>Final version as accepted for Journal Fundamenta Informaticae</p></details> |
| **[Data-driven Projection Generation for Efficiently Solving Heterogeneous Quadratic Programming Problems](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.26061v1)** | 2025-10-30 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a data-driven framework for efficiently solving quadratic programming (QP) problems by reducing the number of variables in high-dimensional QPs using instance-specific projection. A graph neural network-based model is designed to generate projections tailored to each QP instance, enabling us to produce high-quality solutions even for previously unseen problems. The model is trained on heterogeneous QPs to minimize the expected objective value evaluated on the projected solutions. This is formulated as a bilevel optimization problem; the inner optimization solves the QP under a given projection using a QP solver, while the outer optimization updates the model parameters. We develop an efficient algorithm to solve this bilevel optimization problem, which computes parameter gradients without backpropagating through the solver. We provide a theoretical analysis of the generalization ability of solving QPs with projection matrices generated by neural networks. Experimental results demonstrate that our method produces high-quality feasible solutions with reduced computation time, outperforming existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Differentiable Programming for Differential Equations: A Review](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.09699v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The differentiable programming paradigm is a cornerstone of modern scientific computing. It refers to numerical methods for computing the gradient of a numerical model's output. Many scientific models are based on differential equations, where differentiable programming plays a crucial role in calculating model sensitivities, inverting model parameters, and training hybrid models that combine differential equations with data-driven approaches. Furthermore, recognizing the strong synergies between inverse methods and machine learning offers the opportunity to establish a coherent framework applicable to both fields. Differentiating functions based on the numerical solution of differential equations is non-trivial. Numerous methods based on a wide variety of paradigms have been proposed in the literature, each with pros and cons specific to the type of problem investigated. Here, we provide a comprehensive review of existing techniques to compute derivatives of numerical solutions of differential equations. We first discuss the importance of gradients of solutions of differential equations in a variety of scientific domains. Second, we lay out the mathematical foundations of the various approaches and compare them with each other. Third, we cover the computational considerations and explore the solutions available in modern scientific software. Last but not least, we provide best-practices and recommendations for practitioners. We hope that this work accelerates the fusion of scientific models and data, and fosters a modern approach to scientific modelling.</p></details> |  |
| **[New Limits on Distributed Quantum Advantage: Dequantizing Linear Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07574v3)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we give two results that put new limits on distributed quantum advantage in the context of the LOCAL model of distributed computing. First, we show that there is no distributed quantum advantage for any linear program. Put otherwise, if there is a quantum-LOCAL algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ that finds an $α$-approximation of some linear optimization problem $Π$ in $T$ communication rounds, we can construct a classical, deterministic LOCAL algorithm $\mathcal{A}'$ that finds an $α$-approximation of $Π$ in $T$ rounds. As a corollary, all classical lower bounds for linear programs, including the KMW bound, hold verbatim in quantum-LOCAL. Second, using the above result, we show that there exists a locally checkable labeling problem (LCL) for which quantum-LOCAL is strictly weaker than the classical deterministic SLOCAL model. Our results extend from quantum-LOCAL also to finitely dependent and non-signaling distributions, and one of the corollaries of our work is that the non-signaling model and the SLOCAL model are incomparable in the context of LCL problems: By prior work, there exists an LCL problem for which SLOCAL is strictly weaker than the non-signaling model, and our work provides a separation in the opposite direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DISC 2025</p></details> |
| **[User Misconceptions of LLM-Based Conversational Programming Assistants](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25662v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Programming assistants powered by large language models (LLMs) have become widely available, with conversational assistants like ChatGPT proving particularly accessible to less experienced programmers. However, the varied capabilities of these tools across model versions and the mixed availability of extensions that enable web search, code execution, or retrieval-augmented generation create opportunities for user misconceptions about what systems can and cannot do. Such misconceptions may lead to over-reliance, unproductive practices, or insufficient quality control in LLM-assisted programming. Here, we aim to characterize misconceptions that users of conversational LLM-based assistants may have in programming contexts. Using a two-phase approach, we first brainstorm and catalog user misconceptions that may occur, and then conduct a qualitative analysis to examine whether these conceptual issues surface in naturalistic Python-programming conversations with an LLM-based chatbot drawn from an openly available dataset. Indeed, we see evidence that some users have misplaced expectations about the availability of LLM-based chatbot features like web access, code execution, or non-text output generation. We also see potential evidence for deeper conceptual issues around the scope of information required to debug, validate, and optimize programs. Our findings reinforce the need for designing LLM-based tools that more clearly communicate their programming capabilities to users.</p></details> |  |

A Perspective from Logic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25626v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern language models (LMs) exhibit strong deductive reasoning capabilities, yet standard evaluations emphasize correctness while overlooking a key aspect of human-like reasoning: efficiency. In real-world reasoning scenarios, much of the available information is irrelevant, and effective deductive inference requires identifying and ignoring such distractions. We propose a framework for assessing LM reasoning efficiency through the lens of logic programming, introducing a simple method to align proofs written in natural language -- as generated by an LM -- with shortest proofs found by executing the logic program. Efficiency is quantified by measuring how well a model avoids unnecessary inference. Empirically, we construct a dataset of math word problems injected with various number of irrelevant axioms that vary in semantic overlap with the goal theorem. We find that current LMs show marked accuracy declines under such conditions -- even with minimal, domain-consistent distractions -- and the proofs they generate frequently exhibit detours through irrelevant inferences.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Qualitative Analysis of the Teacher and Student Roles in Pair Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.10305v2)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Background: Pair programming is a well-established and versatile agile practice. Previous research has found it to involve far more different roles than the well-known Driver and Observer/Navigator roles. Pair programming often involves heavy knowledge transfer from mainly one partner to the other. Objective: Understand how to fill the ensuing Teacher and Student roles well (positive behavioral patterns). Understand how they may break (anti-patterns). Method: Open coding and axial coding of 17 recorded pair programming sessions with 18 developers from 5 German software companies, plus interviews with 6 different developers from 4 other German companies. Results: We describe six facets of effective Teacher behavior (e.g. Prioritizing Knowledge Transfer) and two facets of effective Student behavior (e.g. Expressing Knowledge Wants). We describe four harmful would-be-Teacher behaviors (e.g. Pushing Unwanted Knowledge), and one harmful would-be-Student behavior (Failing to Provide a Back Channel). Conclusions: The role facets can serve as learning goals and to-do list for developers who want to develop strong pair programming skill. The anti-patterns can serve as warnings for one's own general behavior and as triggers for immediate meta-discussion if they occur within a pairing session.</p></details> |  |
| **[Serve Programs, Not Prompts](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.25412v1)** | 2025-10-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Current large language model (LLM) serving systems, primarily designed for text completion, are neither efficient nor adaptable for increasingly complex LLM applications due to their inflexible design. We propose a new LLM serving system architecture that serves programs instead of prompts to address this problem. These programs, called LLM Inference Programs (LIPs), allow users to customize token prediction and KV cache management at runtime and to offload parts of their application logic, such as tool execution, to the server. We describe an example of this architecture through a system named Symphony, which functions as an operating system for LIPs. Symphony exposes LLM model computations via system calls and virtualizes KV cache with a dedicated file system, while ensuring GPU efficiency with a two-level process scheduling scheme. Symphony has the potential to open the door to a more efficient and extensible ecosystem for LLM applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>HotOS...</summary><p>HotOS 2025.

Current research typically endeavors to achieve unidirectional enhancement: P-CoT enhanced N-CoT or N-CoT enhanced P-CoT. In this paper, we seek to fully unleash the two paradigms' strengths for mutual enhancement and ultimately achieve simultaneous improvements. We conduct a detailed analysis of the error types across two paradigms, based on which we propose Parrot, a novel training pipeline for mathematical problems: 1) Three target-designed subtasks integrate sequential P-CoT and N-CoT generation. 2) A subtask hybrid training strategy to facilitate natural language semantic transferability. 3) The converted N-CoT auxiliary reward is designed to alleviate the sparse rewards in P-CoT optimization. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Parrot significantly enhances both the performance of N-CoT and P-CoT, especially on N-CoT. Using Parrot SFT, the N-CoT performance of LLaMA2 and CodeLLaMA achieve gains of +21.87 and +21.48 on MathQA over the RL baseline, which is resource-intensive.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we propose an efficient verification framework for QEC programs. We define an assertion logic and a program logic specifically crafted for QEC programs and establish a sound proof system. We then develop an efficient method for handling verification conditions (VCs) of QEC programs: for Pauli errors, the VCs are reduced to classical assertions that can be solved by SMT solvers, and for non-Pauli errors, we provide a heuristic algorithm. We formalize the proposed program logic in Coq proof assistant, making it a verified QEC verifier. Additionally, we implement an automated QEC verifier, Veri-QEC, for verifying various fault-tolerant scenarios. We demonstrate the efficiency and broad functionality of the framework by performing different verification tasks across various scenarios. Finally, we present a benchmark of 14 verified stabilizer codes.</p></details> | <details><summary>41 pa...</summary><p>41 pages, 10 figures, 4 tables; v2: Extended version of the paper in PLDI 2025; Evaluated artifact at https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.15267327 v3: revise typos and inconsistencies</p></details> |

However, developers often identify specification violations only during testing, as error messages typically lack the detail necessary for effective diagnosis. Consequently, debugging requires trial and error. This study proposes dcFix, a method for detecting and automatically repairing REST API misuses in client programs. In particular, dcFix identifies non-conforming code fragments, integrates them with the relevant API specifications into prompts, and leverages a Large Language Model (LLM) to produce the corrected code. Our evaluation demonstrates that dcFix accurately detects misuse and outperforms the baseline approach, in which prompts to the LLM omit any indication of code fragments non conforming to REST API specifications.</p></details> |  |

We model the execution space of a concurrent program as a branched topological space, where program states are points and state transitions are paths. Within this framework, we characterize deadlocks as attractors and livelocks as non-contractible loops in the execution space. By employing tools from algebraic topology, particularly homotopy and homology groups, we define a series of concurrent topological invariants to systematically detect and classify these concurrent "singularities" without exhaustively traversing all states. This work aims to establish a geometric and topological foundation for concurrent program verification, transcending the limitations of traditional model checking.</p></details> | 10 pages |

It achieves fault detection and correction at runtime by adding diverse redundancy into programs, minimizing fault mode overlap between redundant program variants. In this work, we propose the automated generation of program variants using large language models. We design, develop and evaluate Galápagos: a tool for generating program variants using LLMs, validating their correctness and equivalence, and using them to assemble N-Version binaries. We evaluate Galápagos by creating N-Version components of real-world C code. Our original results show that Galápagos can produce program variants that are proven to be functionally equivalent, even when the variants are written in a different programming language. Our systematic diversity measurement indicates that functionally equivalent variants produced by Galápagos, are statically different after compilation, and present diverging internal behavior at runtime. We demonstrate that the variants produced by Galápagos can protect C code against real miscompilation bugs which affect the Clang compiler. Overall, our paper shows that producing N-Version software can be drastically automated by advanced usage of practical formal verification and generative language models.</p></details> |  |
| **[Discovering Heuristics with Large Language Models (LLMs) for Mixed-Integer Programs: Single-Machine Scheduling](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.24013v1)** | 2025-10-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Our study contributes to the scheduling and combinatorial optimization literature with new heuristics discovered by leveraging the power of Large Language Models (LLMs). We focus on the single-machine total tardiness (SMTT) problem, which aims to minimize total tardiness by sequencing n jobs on a single processor without preemption, given processing times and due dates. We develop and benchmark two novel LLM-discovered heuristics, the EDD Challenger (EDDC) and MDD Challenger (MDDC), inspired by the well-known Earliest Due Date (EDD) and Modified Due Date (MDD) rules. In contrast to prior studies that employed simpler rule-based heuristics, we evaluate our LLM-discovered algorithms using rigorous criteria, including optimality gaps and solution time derived from a mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulation of SMTT. We compare their performance against state-of-the-art heuristics and exact methods across various job sizes (20, 100, 200, and 500 jobs). For instances with more than 100 jobs, exact methods such as MIP and dynamic programming become computationally intractable. Up to 500 jobs, EDDC improves upon the classic EDD rule and another widely used algorithm in the literature. MDDC consistently outperforms traditional heuristics and remains competitive with exact approaches, particularly on larger and more complex instances. This study shows that human-LLM collaboration can produce scalable, high-performing heuristics for NP-hard constrained combinatorial optimization, even under limited resources when effectively configured.</p></details> |  |
| **[Program Evaluation with Remotely Sensed Outcomes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.10959v3)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Economists often estimate treatment effects in experiments using remotely sensed variables (RSVs), e.g., satellite images or mobile phone activity, in place of directly measured economic outcomes. A common practice is to use an observational sample to train a predictor of the economic outcome from the RSV, and then use these predictions as the outcomes in the experiment. We show that this method is biased whenever the RSV is a post-outcome variable, meaning that variation in the economic outcome causes variation in the RSV. For example, changes in poverty or environmental quality cause changes in satellite images, but not vice versa. As our main result, we nonparametrically identify the treatment effect by formalizing the intuition underlying common practice: the conditional distribution of the RSV given the outcome and treatment is stable across samples. Our identifying formula reveals that efficient inference requires predictions of three quantities from the RSV -- the outcome, treatment, and sample indicator -- whereas common practice only predicts the outcome. Valid inference does not require any rate conditions on RSV predictions, justifying the use of complex deep learning algorithms with unknown statistical properties. We reanalyze the effect of an anti-poverty program in India using satellite images.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Neural Network Framework for Discovering Closed-form Solutions to Quadratic Programs with Linear Constraints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.23737v1)** | 2025-10-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) have been used to model complex optimization problems in many applications, yet have difficulty guaranteeing solution optimality and feasibility, despite training on large datasets. Training a NN as a surrogate optimization solver amounts to estimating a global solution function that maps varying problem input parameters to the corresponding optimal solutions. Work in multiparametric programming (mp) has shown that solutions to quadratic programs (QP) are piece-wise linear functions of the parameters, and researchers have suggested leveraging this property to model mp-QP using NN with ReLU activation functions, which also exhibit piecewise linear behaviour. This paper proposes a NN modeling approach and learning algorithm that discovers the exact closed-form solution to QP with linear constraints, by analytically deriving NN model parameters directly from the problem coefficients without training. Whereas generic DNN cannot guarantee accuracy outside the training distribution, the closed-form NN model produces exact solutions for every discovered critical region of the solution function. To evaluate the closed-form NN model, it was applied to DC optimal power flow problems in electricity management. In terms of Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) optimality and feasibility of solutions, it outperformed a classically trained DNN and was competitive with, or outperformed, a commercial analytic solver (Gurobi) at far less computational cost. For a long-range energy planning problem, it was able to produce optimal and feasible solutions for millions of input parameters within seconds.</p></details> | 21 pages |

Recent methods that augment LLMs with intermediate reasoning steps such as Chain of Thought (CoT) and Program of Thought (PoT) improve performance but often produce undesirable solutions, especially in algorithmic domains. We introduce Per-Instance Program Synthesis (PIPS), a method that generates and refines programs at the instance-level using structural feedback without relying on task-specific guidance or explicit test cases. To further improve performance, PIPS incorporates a confidence metric that dynamically chooses between direct inference and program synthesis on a per-instance basis. Experiments across three frontier LLMs and 30 benchmarks including all tasks of Big Bench Extra Hard (BBEH), visual question answering tasks, relational reasoning tasks, and mathematical reasoning tasks show that PIPS improves the absolute harmonic mean accuracy by up to 8.6% and 9.4% compared to PoT and CoT respectively, and reduces undesirable program generations by 65.1% on the algorithmic tasks compared to PoT with Gemini-2.0-Flash.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NeurIPS 2025. 34 pages, 7 figures</p></details> |

While Large Language Models (LLMs) combined with Planning Domain Description Language (PDDL) offer promise for single-robot scenarios, existing approaches struggle with multi-robot coordination due to brittle task decomposition, poor scalability, and low coordination efficiency. We introduce PIP-LLM, a language-based coordination framework that consists of PDDL-based team-level planning and Integer Programming (IP) based robot-level planning. PIP-LLMs first decomposes the command by translating the command into a team-level PDDL problem and solves it to obtain a team-level plan, abstracting away robot assignment. Each team-level action represents a subtask to be finished by the team. Next, this plan is translated into a dependency graph representing the subtasks' dependency structure. Such a dependency graph is then used to guide the robot-level planning, in which each subtask node will be formulated as an IP-based task allocation problem, explicitly optimizing travel costs and workload while respecting robot capabilities and user-defined constraints. This separation of planning from assignment allows PIP-LLM to avoid the pitfalls of syntax-based decomposition and scale to larger teams. Experiments across diverse tasks show that PIP-LLM improves plan success rate, reduces maximum and average travel costs, and achieves better load balancing compared to state-of-the-art baselines.</p></details> |  |
