| **[A Hypergraph based lower bound on Pliable Index Coding based on Nested Side-Information Sets](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.01539v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In pliable index coding (PICOD), a number of clients are connected via a noise-free broadcast channel to a server which has a list of messages. Each client has a unique subset of messages at the server as side-information, and requests for any one message not in the side-information. A PICOD scheme of length $\ell$ is a set of $\ell$ encoded transmissions broadcast from the server such that all clients are satisfied. Finding the optimal (minimum) length of PICOD and designing PICOD schemes that have small length are the fundamental questions in PICOD. In this paper, we present a new lower bound for the optimal PICOD length using a new structural parameter called the nesting number, denoted by $η(\ch)$ associated with the hypergraph $\ch$ that represents the PICOD problem. While the nesting number bound is not stronger than previously known bounds, it can provide some computational advantages over them. Also, using the nesting number bound, we obtain novel lower bounds for some PICOD problems with special structures, which are tight in some cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[PACIFIC: a framework for generating benchmarks to check Precise Automatically Checked Instruction Following In Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10713v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Model (LLM)-based code assistants have emerged as a powerful application of generative AI, demonstrating impressive capabilities in code generation and comprehension. A key requirement for these systems is their ability to accurately follow user instructions. We present Precise Automatically Checked Instruction Following In Code (PACIFIC), a novel framework designed to automatically generate benchmarks that rigorously assess sequential instruction-following and code dry-running capabilities in LLMs, while allowing control over benchmark difficulty. PACIFIC produces benchmark variants with clearly defined expected outputs, enabling straightforward and reliable evaluation through simple output comparisons. In contrast to existing approaches that often rely on tool usage or agentic behavior, our work isolates and evaluates the LLM's intrinsic ability to reason through code behavior step-by-step without execution (dry running) and to follow instructions. Furthermore, our framework mitigates training data contamination by facilitating effortless generation of novel benchmark variations. We validate our framework by generating a suite of benchmarks spanning a range of difficulty levels and evaluating multiple state-of-the-art LLMs. Our results demonstrate that PACIFIC can produce increasingly challenging benchmarks that effectively differentiate instruction-following and dry running capabilities, even among advanced models. Overall, our framework offers a scalable, contamination-resilient methodology for assessing core competencies of LLMs in code-related tasks.</p></details> |  |
| **[l0-Regularized Sparse Coding-based Interpretable Network for Multi-Modal Image Fusion](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.04519v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-modal image fusion (MMIF) enhances the information content of the fused image by combining the unique as well as common features obtained from different modality sensor images, improving visualization, object detection, and many more tasks. In this work, we introduce an interpretable network for the MMIF task, named FNet, based on an $\ell_0$-regularized multi-modal convolutional sparse coding (MCSC) model. Specifically, for solving the $\ell_0$-regularized CSC problem, we design a learnable $\ell_0$-regularized sparse coding (LZSC) block in a principled manner through deep unfolding. Given different modality source images, FNet first separates the unique and common features from them using the LZSC block and then these features are combined to generate the final fused image. Additionally, we propose an $\ell_0$-regularized MCSC model for the inverse fusion process. Based on this model, we introduce an interpretable inverse fusion network named IFNet, which is utilized during FNet's training. Extensive experiments show that FNet achieves high-quality fusion results across eight different MMIF datasets. Furthermore, we show that FNet enhances downstream object detection \textcolor[rgb]{ 0, 0, 0}{and semantic segmentation} in visible-thermal image pairs. We have also visualized the intermediate results of FNet, which demonstrates the good interpretability of our network.

| **[Decoding Human-LLM Collaboration in Coding: An Empirical Study of Multi-Turn Conversations in the Wild](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10493v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly acting as dynamic conversational interfaces, supporting multi-turn interactions that mimic human-like conversation and facilitate complex tasks like coding. While datasets such as LMSYS-Chat-1M and WildChat capture real-world user-LLM conversations, few studies systematically explore the mechanisms of human-LLM collaboration in coding scenarios. What tortuous paths do users experience during the interaction process? How well do the LLMs follow instructions? Are users satisfied? In this paper, we conduct an empirical analysis on human-LLM coding collaboration using LMSYS-Chat-1M and WildChat datasets to explore the human-LLM collaboration mechanism, LLMs' instruction following ability, and human satisfaction. This study yields interesting findings: 1) Task types shape interaction patterns(linear, star and tree), with code quality optimization favoring linear patterns, design-driven tasks leaning toward tree structures, and queries preferring star patterns; 2) Bug fixing and code refactoring pose greater challenges to LLMs' instruction following, with non-compliance rates notably higher than in information querying; 3) Code quality optimization and requirements-driven development tasks show lower user satisfaction, whereas structured knowledge queries and algorithm designs yield higher levels. These insights offer recommendations for improving LLM interfaces and user satisfaction in coding collaborations, while highlighting avenues for future research on adaptive dialogue systems. We believe this work broadens understanding of human-LLM synergies and supports more effective AI-assisted development.</p></details> |  |
| **[UniCoR: Modality Collaboration for Robust Cross-Language Hybrid Code Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10452v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Effective code retrieval is indispensable and it has become an important paradigm to search code in hybrid mode using both natural language and code snippets. Nevertheless, it remains unclear whether existing approaches can effectively leverage such hybrid queries, particularly in cross-language contexts. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study of representative code models and reveal three challenges: (1) insufficient semantic understanding; (2) inefficient fusion in hybrid code retrieval; and (3) weak generalization in cross-language scenarios. To address these challenges, we propose UniCoR, a novel self-supervised framework that learns Unified Code Representations framework designed to learn unified and robust code representations. Firstly, we design a multi-perspective supervised contrastive learning module to enhance semantic understanding and modality fusion. It aligns representations from multiple perspectives, including code-to-code, natural language-to-code, and natural language-to-natural language, enforcing the model to capture a semantic essence among modalities. Secondly, we introduce a representation distribution consistency learning module to improve cross-language generalization, which explicitly aligns the feature distributions of different programming languages, enabling language-agnostic representation learning. Extensive experiments on both empirical benchmark and large-scale benchmark show that UniCoR outperforms all baseline models, achieving an average improvement of 8.64% in MRR and 11.54% in MAP over the best-performing baseline. Furthermore, UniCoR exhibits stability in hybrid code retrieval and generalization capability in cross-language scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by the 48th IEEE/ACM International Conference on Software Engineering (ICSE 2026)</p></details> |
| **[How to Trick Your AI TA: A Systematic Study of Academic Jailbreaking in LLM Code Evaluation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10415v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The use of Large Language Models (LLMs) as automatic judges for code evaluation is becoming increasingly prevalent in academic environments. But their reliability can be compromised by students who may employ adversarial prompting strategies in order to induce misgrading and secure undeserved academic advantages. In this paper, we present the first large-scale study of jailbreaking LLM-based automated code evaluators in academic context. Our contributions are: (i) We systematically adapt 20+ jailbreaking strategies for jailbreaking AI code evaluators in the academic context, defining a new class of attacks termed academic jailbreaking. (ii) We release a poisoned dataset of 25K adversarial student submissions, specifically designed for the academic code-evaluation setting, sourced from diverse real-world coursework and paired with rubrics and human-graded references, and (iii) In order to capture the multidimensional impact of academic jailbreaking, we systematically adapt and define three jailbreaking metrics (Jailbreak Success Rate, Score Inflation, and Harmfulness). (iv) We comprehensively evalulate the academic jailbreaking attacks using six LLMs. We find that these models exhibit significant vulnerability, particularly to persuasive and role-play-based attacks (up to 97% JSR). Our adversarial dataset and benchmark suite lay the groundwork for next-generation robust LLM-based evaluators in academic code assessment.</p></details> | Under Review |
| **[Performance Analysis of Quantum CSS Error-Correcting Codes via MacWilliams Identities](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.01301v4)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We analyze the performance of quantum stabilizer codes, one of the most important classes for practical implementations, on both symmetric and asymmetric quantum channels. To this aim, we first derive the weight enumerator (WE) for the undetectable errors based on the quantum MacWilliams identities. The WE is then used to evaluate tight upper bounds on the error rate of CSS quantum codes with \acl{MW} decoding. For surface codes we also derive a simple closed form expression of the bounds over the depolarizing channel. We introduce a novel approach that combines the knowledge of WE with a logical operator analysis, allowing the derivation of the exact asymptotic error rate for short codes. For example, on a depolarizing channel with physical error rate $ρ\to 0$, the logical error rate $ρ_\mathrm{L}$ is asymptotically $ρ_\mathrm{L} \approx 16 ρ^2$ for the $[[9,1,3]]$ Shor code, $ρ_\mathrm{L} \approx 16.3 ρ^2$ for the $[[7,1,3]]$ Steane code, $ρ_\mathrm{L} \approx 18.7 ρ^2$ for the $[[13,1,3]]$ surface code, and $ρ_\mathrm{L} \approx 149.3 ρ^3$ for the $[[41,1,5]]$ surface code. For larger codes our bound provides $ρ_\mathrm{L} \approx 1215 ρ^4$ and $ρ_\mathrm{L} \approx 663 ρ^5$ for the $[[85,1,7]]$ and the $[[181,1,10]]$ surface codes, respectively. Finally, we extend our analysis to include realistic, noisy syndrome extraction circuits by modeling error propagation throughout gadgets. This enables estimation of logical error rates under faulty measurements. The performance analysis serves as a design tool for developing fault-tolerant quantum systems by guiding the selection of quantum codes based on their error correction capability. Additionally, it offers a novel perspective on quantum degeneracy, showing it represents the fraction of non-correctable error patterns shared by multiple logical operators.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 10 figures, accepted in Quantum journal</p></details> |
| **[Confucius Code Agent: An Open-sourced AI Software Engineer at Industrial Scale](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10398v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Real-world AI software engineering demands coding agents that can reason over massive repositories, maintain durable memory across and within long sessions, and robustly coordinate complex toolchains at test time. Existing open-source coding agents provide transparency but frequently fall short when pushed to these industrial-scale workloads, while proprietary coding agents offer strong practical performance but limited extensibility, interpretability, and controllability. We present the Confucius Code Agent (CCA), an open-sourced AI software engineer that can operate at an industrial scale. CCA is built atop the Confucius SDK, an open-sourced agent development platform designed around three complementary perspectives: Agent Experience (AX), User Experience (UX), and Developer Experience (DX). The SDK introduces a unified orchestrator with hierarchical working memory for long-context reasoning, a persistent note-taking system for cross-session continual learning, and a modular extension module for robust tool use. Moreover, a meta-agent automates the synthesis, evaluation, and refinement of agent configurations through a build-test-improve loop, enabling rapid agent development on new tasks, environments, and tool stacks. Instantiated on Confucius SDK with these mechanisms, CCA delivers strong performance on real-world software engineering tasks. On SWE-Bench-Pro, CCA achieves a state-of-the-art Resolve@1 performance of 54.3%, substantially improving over prior coding agents. Together, the Confucius SDK and CCA provide a transparent, extensible, and reproducible foundation for AI agents, bridge gaps between research prototypes and production-grade systems, and support agent development and deployment at industrial scale.</p></details> |  |
| **[Screen Reader Programmers in the Vibe Coding Era: Adaptation, Empowerment, and New Accessibility Landscape](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.13270v2)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI agents are reshaping human-computer interaction, shifting users from direct task execution to supervising machine-driven actions, especially the rise of "vibe coding" in programming. Yet little is known about how screen reader programmers interact with AI code assistants in practice. We conducted a longitudinal study with 16 blind and low-vision programmers. Participants completed a GitHub Copilot tutorial, engaged with a programming task, and provided initial feedback. After two weeks of AI-assisted programming, follow-ups examined how their practices and perceptions evolved. Our findings show that code assistants enhanced programming efficiency and bridged accessibility gaps. However, participants struggled to convey intent, interpret AI outputs, and manage multiple views while maintaining situational awareness. They showed diverse preferences for accessibility features, expressed a need to balance automation with control, and encountered barriers when learning to use these tools. Furthermore, we propose design principles and recommendations for more accessible and inclusive human-AI collaborations.</p></details> |  |
| **[Emerging Standards for Machine-to-Machine Video Coding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10230v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machines are increasingly becoming the primary consumers of visual data, yet most deployments of machine-to-machine systems still rely on remote inference where pixel-based video is streamed using codecs optimized for human perception. Consequently, this paradigm is bandwidth intensive, scales poorly, and exposes raw images to third parties. Recent efforts in the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) redesigned the pipeline for machine-to-machine communication: Video Coding for Machines (VCM) is designed to apply task-aware coding tools in the pixel domain, and Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) is designed to compress intermediate neural features to reduce bitrate, preserve privacy, and support compute offload. Experiments show that FCM is capable of maintaining accuracy close to edge inference while significantly reducing bitrate. Additional analysis of H.26X codecs used as inner codecs in FCM reveals that H.265/High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) and H.266/Versatile Video Coding (VVC) achieve almost identical machine task performance, with an average BD-Rate increase of 1.39% when VVC is replaced with HEVC. In contrast, H.264/Advanced Video Coding (AVC) yields an average BD-Rate increase of 32.28% compared to VVC. However, for the tracking task, the impact of codec choice is minimal, with HEVC outperforming VVC and achieving BD Rate of -1.81% and 8.79% for AVC, indicating that existing hardware for already deployed codecs can support machine-to-machine communication without degrading performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improving the decoding performance of CA-polar codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10223v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the use of modern code-agnostic decoders to convert CA-SCL from an incomplete decoder to a complete one. When CA-SCL fails to identify a codeword that passes the CRC check, we apply a code-agnostic decoder that identifies a codeword that satisfies the CRC. We establish that this approach gives gains of up to 0.2 dB in block error rate for CA-Polar codes from the 5G New Radio standard. If, instead, the message had been encoded in a systematic CA-polar code, the gain improves to 0.2 ~ 1dB. Leveraging recent developments in blockwise soft output, we additionally establish that it is possible to control the undetected error rate even when using the CRC for error correction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Feature Coding for Scalable Machine Vision](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10209v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Deep neural networks (DNNs) drive modern machine vision but are challenging to deploy on edge devices due to high compute demands. Traditional approaches-running the full model on-device or offloading to the cloud face trade-offs in latency, bandwidth, and privacy. Splitting the inference workload between the edge and the cloud offers a balanced solution, but transmitting intermediate features to enable such splitting introduces new bandwidth challenges. To address this, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) initiated the Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard, establishing a bitstream syntax and codec pipeline tailored for compressing intermediate features. This paper presents the design and performance of the Feature Coding Test Model (FCTM), showing significant bitrate reductions-averaging 85.14%-across multiple vision tasks while preserving accuracy. FCM offers a scalable path for efficient and interoperable deployment of intelligent features in bandwidth-limited and privacy-sensitive consumer applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This article has been accepted for publication in IEEE Consumer Electronics Magazine</p></details> |
| **[ATLAS: Automated Toolkit for Large-Scale Verified Code Synthesis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10173v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models have shown potential for program verification, but progress is hindered by the scarcity of verified code for training. We present ATLAS, an automated pipeline that synthesizes verified programs at scale to address this data bottleneck. ATLAS generates complete Dafny programs with specifications, implementations, and proofs, producing 2.7K verified programs from which we extract over 19K training examples--more than 7 per verified program--by decomposing the synthesis process into multiple specialized tasks. Fine-tuning Qwen 2.5 7B Coder on this dataset produces substantial gains: +23 percentage points on DafnyBench and +50 percentage points on DafnySynthesis. These results demonstrate that synthetic verified code can effectively enhance LLM capabilities for formal verification.</p></details> |  |
| **[Service Rate Regions of MDS Codes & Fractional Matchings in Quasi-uniform Hypergraphs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.17244v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The service rate region (SRR) has emerged as a critical performance metric for distributed systems that store data redundantly. It measures the system's ability to serve multiple users concurrently. Mathematically, the SRR is a polytope in R^k where each dimension corresponds to the service request rate of one of the k data objects. This paper focuses on systems employing a class of Maximum Distance Separable (MDS) codes. For each code in the class, we characterize the k axes intercept points of its SRR, and the smallest standard simplex that includes the SRR. We use these results to show that the SRR grows with the increasing number of systematic columns in the generator matrices. We establish a graph-theoretic framework associating this SRR problem with fractional matchings in quasi-uniform hypergraphs. Identifying the SRR polytope is equivalent to determining a particular image of the fractional-matching polytope. We introduce a notion of Greedy Matching and show that it is sufficient to focus on these matchings to characterize the SRR rather than the entire matching polytope. With these tools, we determine the SRR of a large subset of the considered class of codes. Our results generalize previous characterizations of systematic and non-systematic MDS-coded systems, offering a unified framework for analyzing service rate regions of codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[AI-powered Code Review with LLMs: Early Results](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.18496v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this paper, we present a novel approach to improving software quality and efficiency through a Large Language Model (LLM)-based model designed to review code and identify potential issues. Our proposed LLM-based AI agent model is trained on large code repositories. This training includes code reviews, bug reports, and documentation of best practices. It aims to detect code smells, identify potential bugs, provide suggestions for improvement, and optimize the code. Unlike traditional static code analysis tools, our LLM-based AI agent has the ability to predict future potential risks in the code. This supports a dual goal of improving code quality and enhancing developer education by encouraging a deeper understanding of best practices and efficient coding techniques. Furthermore, we explore the model's effectiveness in suggesting improvements that significantly reduce post-release bugs and enhance code review processes, as evidenced by an analysis of developer sentiment toward LLM feedback. For future work, we aim to assess the accuracy and efficiency of LLM-generated documentation updates in comparison to manual methods. This will involve an empirical study focusing on manually conducted code reviews to identify code smells and bugs, alongside an evaluation of best practice documentation, augmented by insights from developer discussions and code reviews. Our goal is to not only refine the accuracy of our LLM-based tool but also to underscore its potential in streamlining the software development lifecycle through proactive code improvement and education.</p></details> | 8 pages |
| **[Benchmarking Web API Integration Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20172v5)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>API integration is a cornerstone of our digital infrastructure, enabling software systems to connect and interact. However, as shown by many studies, writing or generating correct code to invoke APIs, particularly web APIs, is challenging. Although large language models (LLMs) have become popular in software development, their effectiveness in automating the generation of web API integration code remains unexplored. In order to address this, we present WAPIIBench, a dataset and evaluation pipeline designed to assess the ability of LLMs to generate web API invocation code. Our experiments with several open-source LLMs reveal that generating API invocations poses a significant challenge, resulting in hallucinated endpoints, incorrect argument usage, and other errors. None of the evaluated open-source models was able to solve more than 40% of the tasks.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published in Proceedings of 2025 2nd IEEE/ACM International Conference on AI-powered Software (AIware), Data & Benchmark Track; updated artifact link to point to the right version</p></details> |
| **[Good quantum codes with addressable and parallelizable transversal non-Clifford gates](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19809v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we prove that for any $m>1$, there exists a family of good qudit quantum codes supporting transversal logical $\mathsf{C}^{m-1}\mathsf{Z}$ gates that can address specified logical qudits and be largely executed in parallel. Building on the family of good quantum error-correcting codes presented in He et al. (2025), which support addressable and transversal logical $\mathsf{CCZ}$ gates, we extend their framework and show how to perform large sets of gates in parallel. The construction relies on the classical algebraic geometry codes of Stichtenoth (IEEE Trans. Inf. Theory, 2006). Our results lead to a substantial reduction in the depth overhead of multi-control-$Z$ circuits. In particular, we show that the minimal depth of any logical $\mathsf{C}^{m-1}\mathsf{Z}$ circuit involving qudits from $m$ distinct code blocks is upper bounded by $O(k^{m-1})$, where $k$ is the code dimension. While this overhead is optimal for dense $\mathsf{C}^{m-1}\mathsf{Z}$ circuits, for sparse circuits we discuss how the depth overhead can be significantly reduced by exploiting the structure of the quantum code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Understanding Chain-of-Thought Effectiveness in Code Generation: An Empirical and Information-Theoretic Analysis](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09679v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve strong performance on code generation, but the mechanisms by which Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting helps remain unclear. We present a systematic empirical and information-theoretic study of CoT effectiveness in neural code generation, evaluating five paradigms (Zero-Shot, Zero-Shot CoT, Self-Planning, Structured CoT, Reasoning-CoT) across six Python benchmarks, a multilingual benchmark with 12 programming languages, and six models from 7B to 480B parameters, using conditional mutual information $I(Y;C|X)$ as a conceptual lens. Our results show that externally guided CoT consistently outperforms direct generation, with structured methods improving Pass@1 by 5--12\% on average while using substantially fewer tokens than reflective reasoning, and that CoT benefits depend on language type systems and model capacity. We further find that reasoning \emph{quality} is critical: high-quality structured CoT from strong generators yields significantly higher accuracy than lightweight alternatives with the same template, whereas naive Zero-Shot CoT can even degrade performance. These findings provide practical guidance for choosing CoT strategies based on model capacity, language characteristics, and task complexity.</p></details> |  |

The feedback shift registers that generate such sequences are discussed. The connections between these sequences and maximum period single-track codes are discussed. Maximum period non-binary single-track Gray codes of length $p^t$ and period $p^{p^t}$ are constructed. These are the first infinite families of maximum period codes presented in the literature.</p></details> |  |

In this work, we systematically study Newtonian motion-controlled text-to-video generation and evaluation, emphasizing physical precision and motion coherence. We introduce MoReGen, a motion-aware, physics-grounded T2V framework that integrates multi-agent LLMs, physics simulators, and renderers to generate reproducible, physically accurate videos from text prompts in the code domain. To quantitatively assess physical validity, we propose object-trajectory correspondence as a direct evaluation metric and present MoReSet, a benchmark of 1,275 human-annotated videos spanning nine classes of Newtonian phenomena with scene descriptions, spatiotemporal relations, and ground-truth trajectories. Using MoReSet, we conduct experiments on existing T2V models, evaluating their physical validity through both our MoRe metrics and existing physics-based evaluators. Our results reveal that state-of-the-art models struggle to maintain physical validity, while MoReGen establishes a principled direction toward physically coherent video synthesis.</p></details> |  |
| **[Directional Diffusion-Style Code Editing Pre-training](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.12079v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code pre-trained models have shown promising effectiveness in various software engineering tasks. Among these tasks, many tasks are related to software evolution and/or code editing. However, existing code pre-trained models often overlook the real-world code editing data and the evolutionary nature of the editing process. In this paper, to simulate the step-by-step code editing process of human developers, we propose DivoT5, a pre-trained model based on directional diffusion at the data level. In DivoT5, we adopt two categories of pre-training tasks. The first category is mask and denoising tasks augmented with a diffusion direction representing code evolution. That is, we first apply a noising process to the code snippets before evolution, and then ask the pre-training process to restore the snippets with noise into the code snippets after evolution. The second category is tasks aiming to reinforce the evolutionary direction. That is, we first generate various intermediate versions for each pair of snippets before and after evolution, and then ask the pre-training process to transform the intermediate versions into the snippet after evolution for each pair. We evaluate DivoT5 for two code-editing scenarios and one non-editing scenario using five downstream tasks. Given each downstream task, we fine-tune the pre-trained DivoT5 to evaluate its effectiveness. Our experimental results show that DivoT5 achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on most tasks in comparison to models of the same scale (220M), large scale (770M) models in fine-tuning, and billion-scale (6.7B, 8B, ChatGPT) models in few-shot settings. For one code-editing task (i.e., automated code review), DivoT5 pre-trained on top of CodeT5-small (60M) can even outperform CodeT5-base (220M) and other pre-trained models with 220M parameters except for DivoT5 pre-trained on top of CodeT5-base (220M).</p></details> |  |
| **[Condor: A Code Discriminator Integrating General Semantics with Code Details](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.17429v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>LLMs demonstrate significant potential across various software engineering tasks. However, they still face challenges in generating correct code on the first attempt when addressing complex requirements. Introducing a discriminator to select reliable outputs from multiple generated results is an effective way to enhance their reliability and stability. Currently, these discriminators fall into two categories: execution-based discriminators and non-execution-based discriminators. Execution-based discriminators face flexibility challenges due to difficulties in obtaining test cases and security concerns, while non-execution-based discriminators, although more flexible, struggle to capture subtle differences in code details. To maintain flexibility while improving the model's ability to capture fine-grained code details, this paper proposes Condor. We first design contrastive learning to optimize the code representations of the base model, enabling it to reflect differences in code details. Then, we leverage intermediate data from the code modification process to further enrich the discriminator's training data, enhancing its ability to discern code details. Experimental results indicate that on the subtle code difference dataset (i.e., CodeNanoFix), Condor significantly outperforms other discriminators in discriminative performance: Condor (1.3B) improves the discriminative F1 score of DeepSeek-Coder (1.3B) from 67% to 73%. In discriminating LLM-generated outputs, Condor (1.3B) and Condor (110M) raise the Pass@1 score of Meta-Llama-3.1-Instruct (70B) on the CodeNanoFix dataset from 52.64% to 62.63% and 59.64%, respectively. Moreover, Condor demonstrates strong generalization capabilities on the APPS, MBPP, and LiveCodeBench datasets. For example, Condor (1.3B) improves the Pass@1 of Meta-Llama-3.1-Instruct (70B) on the APPS dataset by 147.05%.</p></details> |  |
| **[Grammar-Based Code Representation: Is It a Worthy Pursuit for LLMs?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.05507v2)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Grammar serves as a cornerstone in programming languages and software engineering, providing frameworks to define the syntactic space and program structure. Existing research demonstrates the effectiveness of grammar-based code representations in small-scale models, showing their ability to reduce syntax errors and enhance performance. However, as language models scale to the billion level or beyond, syntax-level errors become rare, making it unclear whether grammar information still provides performance benefits. To explore this, we develop a series of billion-scale GrammarCoder models, incorporating grammar rules in the code generation process. Experiments on HumanEval (+) and MBPP (+) demonstrate a notable improvement in code generation accuracy. Further analysis shows that grammar-based representations enhance LLMs' ability to discern subtle code differences, reducing semantic errors caused by minor variations. These findings suggest that grammar-based code representations remain valuable even in billion-scale models, not only by maintaining syntax correctness but also by improving semantic differentiation.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we provide a new lower bound on the size of $t$-fold $s$-blocking sets without the condition $t \leq q$, which is stronger than the classical result of Beutelspacher in 1983. Then a lower bound on lengths of projective $s$-minimal codes is also obtained. It is proved that $(s+1)$-minimal codes are certainly $s$-minimal codes. We generalize the Ashikhmin-Barg condition for minimal codes to $s$-minimal codes. Many infinite families of $s$-minimal codes satisfying and violating this generalized Ashikhmin-Barg condition are constructed. We also give several examples which are binary minimal codes, but not $2$-minimal codes.</p></details> |  |

However, prior studies have shown that LLMs are highly sensitive to prompt perturbations. Minor modifications in wording, syntax, or formatting can significantly reduce the functional correctness of generated code. As perturbations frequently occur in real-world scenarios, improving the robustness of LLMs to prompt perturbations is essential for ensuring reliable performance in practical code generation. In this paper, we introduce CREME (Code Robustness Enhancement via Model Editing), a novel approach that enhances LLM robustness through targeted parameter updates. CREME first identifies robustness-sensitive layers by comparing hidden states between an original prompt and its perturbed variant. Then, it performs lightweight parameter editing at the identified layer to reduce performance degradation. We evaluate CREME on two widely used code generation benchmarks (HumanEval and MBPP) along with their perturbed counterparts. Experimental results show that CREME improves Pass@1 accuracy by 63% on perturbed prompts while maintaining stable performance on clean inputs, with accuracy deviations within 1%. Further analysis reveals that robustness-sensitive layers are primarily concentrated in the middle and deeper layers of the network, and their locations vary across different model architectures. These insights provide a valuable foundation for developing future robustness-oriented editing strategies.</p></details> |  |

This paper presents an overview of the latest Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard, part of MPEG-AI and developed by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG). FCM supports AI-driven applications by enabling the efficient extraction, compression, and transmission of intermediate neural network features. By offloading computationally intensive operations to base servers with high computing resources, FCM allows low-powered devices to leverage large deep learning models. Experimental results indicate that the FCM standard maintains the same level of accuracy while reducing bitrate requirements by 75.90% compared to remote inference.</p></details> |  |
| **[Efficient Black-Box Fault Localization for System-Level Test Code Using Large Language Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2506.19045v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault localization (FL) is a critical step in debugging, which typically relies on repeated executions to pinpoint faulty code regions. However, repeated executions can be impractical in the presence of non-deterministic failures or high execution costs. While recent efforts have leveraged Large Language Models (LLMs) to aid execution-free FL, these have primarily focused on identifying faults in the system-under-test (SUT) rather than in the often complex system-level test code. However, the latter is also important, as in practice, many failures are triggered by faulty test code. To overcome these challenges, we introduce a fully static, LLM-driven approach for system-level test code fault localization (TCFL) that does not require executing the test case. Our method uses a single failure execution log to estimate the test's execution trace through three novel algorithms that identify only code statements likely involved in the failure. This pruned trace, combined with the error message, is used to prompt the LLM to rank potential faulty locations. Our black-box, system-level approach requires no access to the SUT source code and is applicable to complex test scripts that assess full system behavior. We evaluate our technique at the function, block, and line levels using an industrial dataset of faulty test cases that were not used in pre-training LLMs. Results show that our best-estimated traces closely match the actual traces, with an F1 score of around 90%. Additionally, pruning the complex system-level test code reduces the LLM's inference time by up to 34% without any loss in FL performance. Our method achieves equal or higher FL accuracy, requiring over 85% less average inference time per test case and 93% fewer tokens than the latest LLM-guided FL method.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved Pseudorandom Codes from Permuted Puzzles](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08918v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Watermarks are an essential tool for identifying AI-generated content. Recently, Christ and Gunn (CRYPTO '24) introduced pseudorandom error-correcting codes (PRCs), which are equivalent to watermarks with strong robustness and quality guarantees. A PRC is a pseudorandom encryption scheme whose decryption algorithm tolerates a high rate of errors. Pseudorandomness ensures quality preservation of the watermark, and error tolerance of decryption translates to the watermark's ability to withstand modification of the content. In the short time since the introduction of PRCs, several works (NeurIPS '24, RANDOM '25, STOC '25) have proposed new constructions. Curiously, all of these constructions are vulnerable to quasipolynomial-time distinguishing attacks. Furthermore, all lack robustness to edits over a constant-sized alphabet, which is necessary for a meaningfully robust LLM watermark. Lastly, they lack robustness to adversaries who know the watermarking detection key. Until now, it was not clear whether any of these properties was achievable individually, let alone together. We construct pseudorandom codes that achieve all of the above: plausible subexponential pseudorandomness security, robustness to worst-case edits over a binary alphabet, and robustness against even computationally unbounded adversaries that have the detection key. Pseudorandomness rests on a new assumption that we formalize, the permuted codes conjecture, which states that a distribution of permuted noisy codewords is pseudorandom. We show that this conjecture is implied by the permuted puzzles conjecture used previously to construct doubly efficient private information retrieval. To give further evidence, we show that the conjecture holds against a broad class of simple distinguishers, including read-once branching programs.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Causal Perspective on Measuring, Explaining and Mitigating Smells in LLM-Generated Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.15817v3)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) have accelerated their adoption in software engineering contexts. However, concerns persist about the structural quality of the code they produce. In particular, LLMs often replicate poor coding practices, introducing code smells (i.e., patterns that hinder readability, maintainability, or design integrity). Although prior research has examined the detection or repair of smells, we still lack a clear understanding of how and when these issues emerge in generated code. This paper addresses this gap by systematically measuring, explaining and mitigating smell propensity in LLM-generated code. We build on the Propensity Smelly Score (PSC), a probabilistic metric that estimates the likelihood of generating particular smell types, and establish its robustness as a signal of structural quality. Using PSC as an instrument for causal analysis, we identify how generation strategy, model size, model architecture and prompt formulation shape the structural properties of generated code. Our findings show that prompt design and architectural choices play a decisive role in smell propensity and motivate practical mitigation strategies that reduce its occurrence. A user study further demonstrates that PSC helps developers interpret model behavior and assess code quality, providing evidence that smell propensity signals can support human judgement. Taken together, our work lays the groundwork for integrating quality-aware assessments into the evaluation and deployment of LLMs for code.</p></details> |  |

To do so, we investigate multicalibration, which can capture additional factors about a coding problem, such as complexity, code length, or programming language used. We study four multicalibration approaches on three function synthesis benchmarks, using latest-generation code LLMs (Qwen3 Coder, GPT-OSS, DeepSeek-R1-Distill). Our results demonstrate that multicalibration can yield distinct improvements over both uncalibrated token likelihoods (+1.03 in skill score) and baseline calibrations (+0.37 in skill score). We study the influence of the aforementioned factors in ablations, and make our dataset (consisting of code generations, likelihoods, and correctness labels) available for future research on code LLM calibration.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at AI-SQE 2026 (The 1st International Workshop on AI for Software Quality Evaluation: Judgment, Metrics, Benchmarks, and Beyond)</p></details> |

As graphs get larger, the irregular access patterns exhibited in most graph algorithms, hamper performance. This, along with NUMA and physical memory limits, results in scaling complexities with sequential/shared memory frameworks. StarPlat's MPI backend abstracts away the programmatic complexity involved in designing optimal distributed graph algorithms. It provides an instrument for coding graph algorithms that scale over distributed memory. In this work, we provide an analysis-transformation framework that leverages general semantics associated with iterations involving nodes and their neighbors, within StarPlat, to aggregate communication. The framework scans for patterns that warrant re-ordering in neighborhood access patterns, aggregate communication, and avoid communication altogether with opportunistic caching in reduction constructs. We also architect an optimized bulk-reduction substrate using Open MPI's passive Remote Memory Access (RMA) constructs. We applied our optimization logic to StarPlat's distributed backend and outperformed d-Galois by 2.05 and DRONE by 1.44 times in Single Source Shortest Paths across several big data graphs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Skew polynomial representations of matrix algebras and applications to coding theory](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08602v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We extend the existing skew polynomial representations of matrix algebras which are direct sum of matrix spaces over division rings. In this representation, the sum-rank distance between two tuples of matrices is captured by a weight function on their associated skew polynomials, defined through degrees and greatest common right divisors with the polynomial that defines the representation. We exploit this representation to construct new families of maximum sum-rank distance (MSRD) codes over finite and infinite fields, and over division rings. These constructions generalize many of the known existing constructions of MSRD codes as well as of optimal codes in the rank and in the Hamming metric. As a byproduct, in the case of finite fields we obtain new families of MDS codes which are linear over a subfield and whose length is close to the field size.</p></details> |  |
| **[When Many-Shot Prompting Fails: An Empirical Study of LLM Code Translation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.16809v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) with vast context windows offer new avenues for in-context learning (ICL), where providing many examples ("many-shot" prompting) is often assumed to enhance performance. We investigate this assumption for the complex task of code translation. Through a large-scale empirical study of over 90,000 translations, we systematically evaluate the impact of scaling in-context examples from zero-shot to many-shot configurations of up to 625 examples, with prompts spanning from approximately 100,000 to 800,000 tokens. Our findings reveal a "many-shot paradox": while static similarity metrics may modestly improve with more examples, functional correctness consistently peaks with few-shot prompting (5-25 examples). Providing substantially more examples often degrades this crucial functional performance. This study highlights that for code translation, the quality of a few well-chosen examples outweighs sheer quantity, challenging the universal efficacy of "more is better" for ICL and underscoring the task-dependent nature of optimal prompting strategies. Our results have significant implications for effectively leveraging LLMs in software engineering.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to ICSE 2026 (RECODE workshop)</p></details> |

The automation of the source code vulnerability detection (CVD) process has thus become essential, and several methods have been proposed ranging from the well established program analysis techniques to the more recent AI-based methods. Our research investigates Large Language Models (LLMs), which are considered among the most performant AI models to date, for the CVD task. The objective is to study their performance and apply different state-of-the-art techniques to enhance their effectiveness for this task. We explore various fine-tuning and prompt engineering settings. We particularly suggest one novel approach for fine-tuning LLMs which we call Double Fine-tuning, and also test the understudied Test-Time fine-tuning approach. We leverage the recent open-source Llama-3.1 8B, with source code samples extracted from BigVul and PrimeVul datasets. Our conclusions highlight the importance of fine-tuning to resolve the task, the performance of Double tuning, as well as the potential of Llama models for CVD. Though prompting proved ineffective, Retrieval augmented generation (RAG) performed relatively well as an example selection technique. Overall, some of our research questions have been answered, and many are still on hold, which leaves us many future work perspectives.

Data Augmentation could help solve this by mitigating the scarcity of under-represented CWEs. In this context, we investigate LLM-based augmentation for vulnerable functions, comparing controlled generation of new vulnerable samples with semantics-preserving refactoring of existing ones. Using Qwen2.5-Coder to produce augmented data and CodeBERT as a vulnerability classifier on the SVEN dataset, we find that our approaches are indeed effective in enriching vulnerable code-bases through a simple process and with reasonable quality, and that a hybrid strategy best boosts vulnerability classifiers' performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, Submitted to ESAAN 2026, Under pier review</p></details> |
| **[Autonomous Issue Resolver: Towards Zero-Touch Code Maintenance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08492v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in Large Language Models have revolutionized function-level code generation; however, repository-scale Automated Program Repair (APR) remains a significant challenge. Current approaches typically employ a control-centric paradigm, forcing agents to navigate complex directory structures and irrelevant control logic. In this paper, we propose a paradigm shift from the standard Code Property Graphs (CPGs) to the concept of Data Transformation Graph (DTG) that inverts the topology by modeling data states as nodes and functions as edges, enabling agents to trace logic defects through data lineage rather than control flow. We introduce a multi-agent framework that reconciles data integrity navigation with control flow logic. Our theoretical analysis and case studies demonstrate that this approach resolves the "Semantic Trap" inherent in standard RAG systems in modern coding agents. We provide a comprehensive implementation in the form of Autonomous Issue Resolver (AIR), a self-improvement system for zero-touch code maintenance that utilizes neuro-symbolic reasoning and uses the DTG structure for scalable logic repair. Our approach has demonstrated good results on several SWE benchmarks, reaching a resolution rate of 87.1% on SWE-Verified benchmark. Our approach directly addresses the core limitations of current AI code-assistant tools and tackles the critical need for a more robust foundation for our increasingly software-dependent world.</p></details> | 21 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Token Sugar: Making Source Code Sweeter for LLMs through Token-Efficient Shorthand](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08266v1)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have shown exceptional performance in code generation and understanding tasks, yet their high computational costs hinder broader adoption. One important factor is the inherent verbosity of programming languages, such as unnecessary formatting elements and lengthy boilerplate code. This leads to inflated token counts in both input and generated outputs, which increases inference costs and slows down the generation process. Prior work improves this through simplifying programming language grammar, reducing token usage across both code understanding and generation tasks. However, it is confined to syntactic transformations, leaving significant opportunities for token reduction unrealized at the semantic level. In this work, we propose Token Sugar, a concept that replaces frequent and verbose code patterns with reversible, token-efficient shorthand in the source code. To realize this concept in practice, we designed a systematic solution that mines high-frequency, token-heavy patterns from a code corpus, maps each to a unique shorthand, and integrates them into LLM pretraining via code transformation. With this solution, we obtain 799 (code pattern, shorthand) pairs, which can reduce up to 15.1% token count in the source code and is complementary to existing syntax-focused methods. We further trained three widely used LLMs on Token Sugar-augmented data. Experimental results show that these models not only achieve significant token savings (up to 11.2% reduction) during generation but also maintain near-identical Pass@1 scores compared to baselines trained on unprocessed code.</p></details> | Accepted by ASE'25 |

While sampling techniques improve pass@k metrics, hardware engineers need one trustworthy solution rather than uncertain candidates. To bridge this gap, we formulate it as a semantic alignment problem between requirements and Verilog implementations, and propose VCD-RNK, a discriminator model tailored for efficient Verilog code reranking. Specifically, VCD-RNKincorporates Verilog-specific reasoning by distilling expert knowledge across three dimensions: code semantic analysis, test case generation, and functional correctness assessment. By explicitly simulating the above reasoning processes during inference, VCD-RNK effectively avoids computationally intensive test execution in existing methods.</p></details> | Work in Progress |

However, in split inference systems-where intermediate features from neural network are transmitted instead of pixel data-these assumptions no longer apply. Intermediate features are abstract, sparse, and task-specific, making perceptual fidelity irrelevant. In this paper, we investigate the use of Versatile Video Coding (VVC) for compressing such features under the MPEG-AI Feature Coding for Machines (FCM) standard. We perform a tool-level analysis to understand the impact of individual coding components on compression efficiency and downstream vision task accuracy. Based on these insights, we propose three lightweight essential VVC profiles-Fast, Faster, and Fastest. The Fast profile provides 2.96% BD-Rate gain while reducing encoding time by 21.8%. Faster achieves a 1.85% BD-Rate gain with a 51.5% speedup. Fastest reduces encoding time by 95.6% with only a 1.71% loss in BD-Rate.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted for presentation at ICIP 2025 workshop on Coding for Machines</p></details> |
| **[Understanding Privacy Risks in Code Models Through Training Dynamics: A Causal Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07814v2)** | 2025-12-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models for code (LLM4Code) have greatly improved developer productivity but also raise privacy concerns due to their reliance on open-source repositories containing abundant personally identifiable information (PII). Prior work shows that commercial models can reproduce sensitive PII, yet existing studies largely treat PII as a single category and overlook the heterogeneous risks among different types. We investigate whether distinct PII types vary in their likelihood of being learned and leaked by LLM4Code, and whether this relationship is causal. Our methodology includes building a dataset with diverse PII types, fine-tuning representative models of different scales, computing training dynamics on real PII data, and formulating a structural causal model to estimate the causal effect of learnability on leakage. Results show that leakage risks differ substantially across PII types and correlate with their training dynamics: easy-to-learn instances such as IP addresses exhibit higher leakage, while harder types such as keys and passwords leak less frequently. Ambiguous types show mixed behaviors. This work provides the first causal evidence that leakage risks are type-dependent and offers guidance for developing type-aware and learnability-aware defenses for LLM4Code.</p></details> | 21 pages, 8 figures |

To obtain the locality and availability properties, and to estimate the minimum distance of the codes, we combine techniques coming from the theory of one-variable function fields and from the theory of fibrations on surfaces. When the locality parameter is $r=3$, we obtain a sharp bound on the minimum distance of the codes. In that case, we give a geometric interpretation of our codes in terms of doubly elliptic surfaces. In particular, this provides the first instance of an error correcting code constructed using a (doubly elliptic) K3 surface.</p></details> |  |
| **[Image2Gcode: Image-to-G-code Generation for Additive Manufacturing Using Diffusion-Transformer Model](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.20636v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Mechanical design and manufacturing workflows conventionally begin with conceptual design, followed by the creation of a computer-aided design (CAD) model and fabrication through material-extrusion (MEX) printing. This process requires converting CAD geometry into machine-readable G-code through slicing and path planning. While each step is well established, dependence on CAD modeling remains a major bottleneck: constructing object-specific 3D geometry is slow and poorly suited to rapid prototyping. Even minor design variations typically necessitate manual updates in CAD software, making iteration time-consuming and difficult to scale. To address this limitation, we introduce Image2Gcode, an end-to-end data-driven framework that bypasses the CAD stage and generates printer-ready G-code directly from images and part drawings. Instead of relying on an explicit 3D model, a hand-drawn or captured 2D image serves as the sole input. The framework first extracts slice-wise structural cues from the image and then employs a denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) over G-code sequences. Through iterative denoising, the model transforms Gaussian noise into executable print-move trajectories with corresponding extrusion parameters, establishing a direct mapping from visual input to native toolpaths. By producing structured G-code directly from 2D imagery, Image2Gcode eliminates the need for CAD or STL intermediates, lowering the entry barrier for additive manufacturing and accelerating the design-to-fabrication cycle. This approach supports on-demand prototyping from simple sketches or visual references and integrates with upstream 2D-to-3D reconstruction modules to enable an automated pipeline from concept to physical artifact. The result is a flexible, computationally efficient framework that advances accessibility in design iteration, repair workflows, and distributed manufacturing.</p></details> |  |
| **[Structure Theorems (and Fast Algorithms) for List Recovery of Subspace-Design Codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08017v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>List recovery of error-correcting codes has emerged as a fundamental notion with broad applications across coding theory and theoretical computer science. Folded Reed-Solomon (FRS) and univariate multiplicity codes are explicit constructions which can be efficiently list-recovered up to capacity, namely a fraction of errors approaching $1-R$ where $R$ is the code rate. Chen and Zhang and related works showed that folded Reed-Solomon codes and linear codes must have list sizes exponential in $1/ε$ for list-recovering from an error-fraction $1-R-ε$. These results suggest that one cannot list-recover FRS codes in time that is also polynomial in $1/ε$. In contrast to such limitations, we show, extending algorithmic advances of Ashvinkumar, Habib, and Srivastava for list decoding, that even if the lists in the case of list-recovery are large, they are highly structured. In particular, we can output a compact description of a set of size only $\ell^{O((\log \ell)/ε)}$ which contains the relevant list, while running in time only polynomial in $1/ε$ (the previously known compact description due to Guruswami and Wang had size $\approx n^{\ell/ε}$). We also improve on the state-of-the-art algorithmic results for the task of list-recovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[A scalable and real-time neural decoder for topological quantum codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07737v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Fault-tolerant quantum computing will require error rates far below those achievable with physical qubits. Quantum error correction (QEC) bridges this gap, but depends on decoders being simultaneously fast, accurate, and scalable. This combination of requirements has not yet been met by a machine-learning decoder, nor by any decoder for promising resource-efficient codes such as the colour code. Here we introduce AlphaQubit 2, a neural-network decoder that achieves near-optimal logical error rates for both surface and colour codes at large scales under realistic noise. For the colour code, it is orders of magnitude faster than other high-accuracy decoders. For the surface code, we demonstrate real-time decoding faster than 1 microsecond per cycle up to distance 11 on current commercial accelerators with better accuracy than leading real-time decoders. These results support the practical application of a wider class of promising QEC codes, and establish a credible path towards high-accuracy, real-time neural decoding at the scales required for fault-tolerant quantum computation.</p></details> |  |

However, existing methods still face significant challenges in achieving high-fidelity document-to-codebase synthesis--such as scientific papers to code--primarily due to a fundamental conflict between information overload and the context bottlenecks of LLMs. In this work, we introduce DeepCode, a fully autonomous framework that fundamentally addresses this challenge through principled information-flow management. By treating repository synthesis as a channel optimization problem, DeepCode seamlessly orchestrates four information operations to maximize task-relevant signals under finite context budgets: source compression via blueprint distillation, structured indexing using stateful code memory, conditional knowledge injection via retrieval-augmented generation, and closed-loop error correction. Extensive evaluations on the PaperBench benchmark demonstrate that DeepCode achieves state-of-the-art performance, decisively outperforming leading commercial agents such as Cursor and Claude Code, and crucially, surpassing PhD-level human experts from top institutes on key reproduction metrics. By systematically transforming paper specifications into production-grade implementations comparable to human expert quality, this work establishes new foundations for autonomous scientific reproduction that can accelerate research evaluation and discovery.</p></details> | <details><summary>for s...</summary><p>for source code, please see https://github.com/HKUDS/DeepCode</p></details> |
| **[Bridging Code Graphs and Large Language Models for Better Code Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07666v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in code intelligence tasks such as code generation, summarization, and translation. However, their reliance on linearized token sequences limits their ability to understand the structural semantics of programs. While prior studies have explored graphaugmented prompting and structure-aware pretraining, they either suffer from prompt length constraints or require task-specific architectural changes that are incompatible with large-scale instructionfollowing LLMs. To address these limitations, this paper proposes CGBridge, a novel plug-and-play method that enhances LLMs with Code Graph information through an external, trainable Bridge module. CGBridge first pre-trains a code graph encoder via selfsupervised learning on a large-scale dataset of 270K code graphs to learn structural code semantics. It then trains an external module to bridge the modality gap among code, graph, and text by aligning their semantics through cross-modal attention mechanisms. Finally, the bridge module generates structure-informed prompts, which are injected into a frozen LLM, and is fine-tuned for downstream code intelligence tasks. Experiments show that CGBridge achieves notable improvements over both the original model and the graphaugmented prompting method. Specifically, it yields a 16.19% and 9.12% relative gain in LLM-as-a-Judge on code summarization, and a 9.84% and 38.87% relative gain in Execution Accuracy on code translation. Moreover, CGBridge achieves over 4x faster inference than LoRA-tuned models, demonstrating both effectiveness and efficiency in structure-aware code understanding.</p></details> |  |

However, the security implications of using LLMs for code translation remain largely unexplored, as existing evaluations primarily focus on syntactic and functional correctness. To bridge this gap, we conduct a security-centric empirical study to investigate the risks of vulnerabilities being introduced or preserved during LLM-based translation. Our study involves a rigorous evaluation of five state-of-the-art LLMs on a curated dataset of 720 security-related code samples across four programming languages (Java, PHP, C, C++) and nine Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) categories. The results reveal significant security degradation, with 28.6\% to 45\% of translations introducing new vulnerabilities. Web-related flaws, particularly in input validation, proved most challenging for LLMs. Furthermore, we identify and categorize the root causes of these vulnerable translations into a taxonomy of five major error types. Based on our findings, we develop and evaluate a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based mitigation strategy, which successfully reduces the vulnerability introduction rate by 32.8\%. Our study provides the first large-scale evidence of serious security risks in LLM-based code translation and demonstrates the potential of knowledge-enhanced prompting to mitigate them.</p></details> |  |
| **[Learning to Align Human Code Preferences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20109v2)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated remarkable potential in automating software development tasks. While recent advances leverage Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) to align models with human preferences, the optimal training strategy remains unclear across diverse code preference scenarios. This paper systematically investigates the roles of SFT and DPO in aligning LLMs with different code preferences. Through both theoretical analysis and empirical observation, we hypothesize that SFT excels in scenarios with objectively verifiable optimal solutions, while applying SFT followed by DPO (S&D) enables models to explore superior solutions in scenarios without objectively verifiable optimal solutions. Based on the analysis and experimental evidence, we propose Adaptive Preference Optimization (APO), a dynamic integration approach that adaptively amplifies preferred responses, suppresses dispreferred ones, and encourages exploration of potentially superior solutions during training. Extensive experiments across six representative code preference tasks validate our theoretical hypotheses and demonstrate that APO consistently matches or surpasses the performance of existing SFT and S&D strategies. Our work provides both theoretical foundations and practical guidance for selecting appropriate training strategies in different code preference alignment scenarios.</p></details> |  |

With the rise of large language models (LLMs), long-standing efforts at autoformalization have gained new momentum. However, existing approaches suffer from severe syntactic and semantic errors due to the scarcity of domain-specific pre-training corpora and often fail to formalize implicit knowledge effectively. In this paper, we propose AutoICE, an LLM-driven evolutionary search for synthesizing verifiable C code. It introduces the diverse individual initialization and the collaborative crossover to enable diverse iterative updates, thereby mitigating error propagation inherent in single-agent iterations. Besides, it employs the self-reflective mutation to facilitate the discovery of implicit knowledge. Evaluation results demonstrate the effectiveness of AutoICE: it successfully verifies $90.36$\% of code, outperforming the state-of-the-art (SOTA) approach. Besides, on a developer-friendly dataset variant, AutoICE achieves a $88.33$\% verification success rate, significantly surpassing the $65$\% success rate of the SOTA approach.</p></details> |  |
| **[Single-step Diffusion-based Video Coding with Semantic-Temporal Guidance](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07480v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>While traditional and neural video codecs (NVCs) have achieved remarkable rate-distortion performance, improving perceptual quality at low bitrates remains challenging. Some NVCs incorporate perceptual or adversarial objectives but still suffer from artifacts due to limited generation capacity, whereas others leverage pretrained diffusion models to improve quality at the cost of heavy sampling complexity. To overcome these challenges, we propose S2VC, a Single-Step diffusion based Video Codec that integrates a conditional coding framework with an efficient single-step diffusion generator, enabling realistic reconstruction at low bitrates with reduced sampling cost. Recognizing the importance of semantic conditioning in single-step diffusion, we introduce Contextual Semantic Guidance to extract frame-adaptive semantics from buffered features. It replaces text captions with efficient, fine-grained conditioning, thereby improving generation realism. In addition, Temporal Consistency Guidance is incorporated into the diffusion U-Net to enforce temporal coherence across frames and ensure stable generation. Extensive experiments show that S2VC delivers state-of-the-art perceptual quality with an average 52.73% bitrate saving over prior perceptual methods, underscoring the promise of single-step diffusion for efficient, high-quality video compression.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do LLMs Trust the Code They Write?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07404v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite the effectiveness of large language models (LLMs) for code generation, they often output incorrect code. One reason is that model output probabilities are often not well-correlated with correctness, and reflect only the final output of the generation process. Inspired by findings that LLMs internally encode concepts like truthfulness, this paper explores if LLMs similarly represent code correctness. Specifically, we identify a correctness representation inside LLMs by contrasting the hidden states between pairs of correct and incorrect code for the same programming tasks. By experimenting on four LLMs, we show that exploiting this extracted correctness representation outperforms standard log-likelihood ranking, as well as verbalized model confidence. Furthermore, we explore how this internal correctness signal can be used to select higher-quality code samples, without requiring test execution. Ultimately, this work demonstrates how leveraging internal representations can enhance code generation systems and make LLMs more reliable, thus improving confidence in automatically generated code.</p></details> |  |
| **[Dualities of dihedral and generalised quaternion codes and applications to quantum codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07354v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Let $\mathbb{F}_q$ be a finite field of $q$ elements, for some prime power $q$, and let $G$ be a finite group. A (left) group code, or simply a $G$-code, is a (left) ideal of the group algebra $\mathbb{F}_q[G]$. In this paper, we provide a complete algebraic description for the hermitian dual code of any $D_n$-code over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$, where $D_n$ is a dihedral group of order $2n$ with $\gcd(q,n)=1$, through a suitable Wedderburn-Artin's decomposition of the group algebra $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[D_n]$, and we determine all distinct hermitian self-orthogonal $D_n$-codes over $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}$. We also present a thorough representation of the euclidean dual code of any $Q_n$-code over $\mathbb{F}_q$, where $Q_n$ is a generalised quaternion group of order $4n$ with $\gcd(q,4n)=1$, via the Wedderburn-Artin's decomposition of the group algebra $\mathbb{F}_q[Q_n]$. In particular, since the semisimple group algebras $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[Q_n]$ and $\mathbb{F}_{q^2}[D_{2n}]$ are isomorphic, then the hermitian dual code of any $Q_n$-code has also been fully described. As application of the hermitian dualities computed, we give a systematic construction, via the structure of the group algebra, to obtain quantum error-correcting codes, and in fact we rebuild some already known optimal quantum codes with this methodical approach.</p></details> |  |

In this paper, we construct four infinite families of linear codes over the ring $\frac{\mathbb{F}_q[u]}{\langle u^2 \rangle}$ whose defining sets are certain nonempty subsets of $\mathcal{R}^m$ associated with three simplicial complexes of $\mathbb{F}_q^m,$ each possessing a single maximal element. We explicitly determine the parameters and Lee weight distributions of these codes. We also study their Gray images and obtain three infinite families of few weight, near Griesmer, distance optimal and minimal codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ with new parameters. We also provide two constructions of infinite families of projective few weight codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ with new parameters, and observe that these codes are self orthogonal for $q=2$ or $3.$ Additionally, we obtain two infinite families of binary distance optimal projective codes and an infinite family of dimension optimal projective codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$ with new parameters. Apart from this, we construct an infinite family of quaternary projective $3$-weight codes whose non zero Hamming weights sum to $\frac{9}{4}$ times the code length, which give rise to strongly walk regular graphs. As an application of our newly constructed minimal codes over $\mathbb{F}_q$, we examine the minimal access structures of Massey's secret sharing schemes based on their duals and determine the number of dictatorial participants in these schemes. Finally, we investigate the locality properties of our newly constructed projective codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Improved bounds and optimal constructions of pure quantum locally recoverable codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07256v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By incorporating the concept of locality into quantum information theory, quantum locally recoverable codes (qLRCs) have been proposed, motivated by their potential applications in large-scale quantum data storage and their relevance to quantum LDPC codes. Despite the progress in optimal quantum error-correcting codes (QECCs), optimal constructions of qLRCs remain largely unexplored, partly due to the fact that the existing bounds for qLRCs are not sufficiently tight. In this paper, we focus on pure qLRCs derived from the Hermitian construction. We provide several new bounds for pure qLRCs and demonstrate that they are tighter than previously known bounds. Moreover, we show that a variety of classical QECCs, including quantum Hamming codes, quantum GRM codes, and quantum Solomon-Stiffler codes, give rise to pure qLRCs with explicit parameters. Based on these constructions, we further identify many infinite families of optimal qLRCs with respect to different bounds, achieving code lengths much larger than those of known optimal qLRCs.</p></details> | <details><summary>17 pa...</summary><p>17 pages, 3 figures, another related work is about to be released</p></details> |
| **[Function-Correcting Codes for Insertion-Deletion Channel](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07243v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In coding theory, handling errors that occur when symbols are inserted or deleted from a transmitted message is a long-standing challenge. Optimising redundancy for insertion and deletion channels remains a key open problem with significant importance for applications in DNA data storage and document exchange. Recently, a coding framework known as function-correcting codes has been proposed to address the challenge of minimising redundancy while preserving specific functions of the message. This framework has gained attention due to its potential applications in machine learning systems and long-term archival data storage. Motivated by the problem of redundancy optimisation for insertion and deletion channels, we propose a new framework called function-correcting codes for insdel channels. In this paper, we introduce the notions of function-correcting insertion codes, function-correcting deletion codes, and function-correcting insdel codes, and we show that these three formulations are equivalent. We then define insdel distance matrices and irregular insdel-distance codes, and derive lower and upper bounds on the optimal redundancy achievable by function-correcting codes for insdel channels. In addition, we establish Gilbert-Varshamov and Plotkin-like bounds on the length of irregular insdel-distance codes. Using the relation between optimal redundancy and the length of such codes, we obtain a simplified lower bound on optimal redundancy. Finally, we derive bounds on the optimal redundancy of function-correcting insdel codes for several classes of functions, including locally bounded functions, VT syndrome functions, the number-of-runs function, and the maximum-run-length function.</p></details> |  |
| **[QiMeng-SALV: Signal-Aware Learning for Verilog Code Generation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.19296v4)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The remarkable progress of Large Language Models (LLMs) presents promising opportunities for Verilog code generation which is significantly important for automated circuit design. The lacking of meaningful functional rewards hinders the preference optimization based on Reinforcement Learning (RL) for producing functionally correct Verilog code. In this paper, we propose Signal-Aware Learning for Verilog code generation (QiMeng-SALV) by leveraging code segments of functionally correct output signal to optimize RL training. Considering Verilog code specifies the structural interconnection of hardware gates and wires so that different output signals are independent, the key insight of QiMeng-SALV is to extract verified signal-aware implementations in partially incorrect modules, so as to enhance the extraction of meaningful functional rewards. Roughly, we verify the functional correctness of signals in generated module by comparing with that of reference module in the training data. Then abstract syntax tree (AST) is employed to identify signal-aware code segments which can provide meaningful functional rewards from erroneous modules. Finally, we introduce signal-aware DPO which is optimized on the correct signal-level code segments, thereby preventing noise and interference from incorrect signals. The proposed QiMeng-SALV underscores the paradigm shift from conventional module-level to fine-grained signal-level optimization in Verilog code generation, addressing the issue of insufficient functional rewards. Experiments demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on VerilogEval and RTLLM, with a 7B parameter model matching the performance of the DeepSeek v3 671B model and significantly outperforming the leading open-source model CodeV trained on the same dataset.

| **[Understanding Diffusion Models via Code Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07201v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diffusion models have achieved remarkable performance in generative modeling, yet their theoretical foundations are often intricate, and the gap between mathematical formulations in papers and practical open-source implementations can be difficult to bridge. Existing tutorials primarily focus on deriving equations, offering limited guidance on how diffusion models actually operate in code. To address this, we present a concise implementation of approximately 300 lines that explains diffusion models from a code-execution perspective. Our minimal example preserves the essential components -- including forward diffusion, reverse sampling, the noise-prediction network, and the training loop -- while removing unnecessary engineering details. This technical report aims to provide researchers with a clear, implementation-first understanding of how diffusion models work in practice and how code and theory correspond.

| **[Beam search decoder for quantum LDPC codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07057v1)** | 2025-12-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a decoder for quantum low density parity check (LDPC) codes based on a beam search heuristic guided by belief propagation (BP). Our beam search decoder applies to all quantum LDPC codes and achieves different speed-accuracy tradeoffs by tuning its parameters such as the beam width. We perform numerical simulations under circuit level noise for the $[[144, 12, 12]]$ bivariate bicycle (BB) code at noise rate $p=10^{-3}$ to estimate the logical error rate and the 99.9 percentile runtime and we compare with the BP-OSD decoder which has been the default quantum LDPC decoder for the past six years. A variant of our beam search decoder with a beam width of 64 achieves a $17\times$ reduction in logical error rate. With a beam width of 8, we reach the same logical error rate as BP-OSD with a $26.2\times$ reduction in the 99.9 percentile runtime. We identify the beam search decoder with beam width of 32 as a promising candidate for trapped ion architectures because it achieves a $5.6\times$ reduction in logical error rate with a 99.9 percentile runtime per syndrome extraction round below 1ms at $p=5 \times10^{-4}$. Remarkably, this is achieved in software on a single core, without any parallelization or specialized hardware (FPGA, ASIC), suggesting one might only need three 32-core CPUs to decode a trapped ion quantum computer with 1000 logical qubits.</p></details> |  |
| **[CERNet: Class-Embedding Predictive-Coding RNN for Unified Robot Motion, Recognition, and Confidence Estimation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.07041v1)** | 2025-12-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Robots interacting with humans must not only generate learned movements in real-time, but also infer the intent behind observed behaviors and estimate the confidence of their own inferences. This paper proposes a unified model that achieves all three capabilities within a single hierarchical predictive-coding recurrent neural network (PC-RNN) equipped with a class embedding vector, CERNet, which leverages a dynamically updated class embedding vector to unify motor generation and recognition. The model operates in two modes: generation and inference. In the generation mode, the class embedding constrains the hidden state dynamics to a class-specific subspace; in the inference mode, it is optimized online to minimize prediction error, enabling real-time recognition. Validated on a humanoid robot across 26 kinesthetically taught alphabets, our hierarchical model achieves 76% lower trajectory reproduction error than a parameter-matched single-layer baseline, maintains motion fidelity under external perturbations, and infers the demonstrated trajectory class online with 68% Top-1 and 81% Top-2 accuracy. Furthermore, internal prediction errors naturally reflect the model's confidence in its recognition. This integration of robust generation, real-time recognition, and intrinsic uncertainty estimation within a compact PC-RNN framework offers a compact and extensible approach to motor memory in physical robots, with potential applications in intent-sensitive human-robot collaboration.</p></details> |  |

While this field has garnered considerable attention, the exploration of testing and evaluating the robustness of code generation models remains an ongoing endeavor. Previous studies have primarily focused on code generation models specifically for the Python language, overlooking other widely-used programming languages. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparative analysis to assess the robustness performance of several prominent code generation models and investigate whether robustness can be improved by repairing perturbed docstrings using an LLM. Furthermore, we investigate how their performance varies across different programming languages. To accomplish this, we introduce perturbations in four key areas of the prompt: DocString, functionname, syntax, and format. We have compiled and released a dedicated dataset for this purpose. This work presents our experimental findings, shedding light on the performance of code generation models in various scenarios.</p></details> | <details><summary>46 pa...</summary><p>46 pages, 10 figures, 16 tables</p></details> |

While automatic code translation offers a promising solution, it has long remained a challenging task. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown potential for this task, yet existing approaches remain limited in accuracy and fail to effectively leverage contextual and structural cues within the code. Prior work has explored translation and repair mechanisms, but lacks a structured, agentic framework where multiple specialized agents collaboratively improve translation quality. In this work, we introduce BabelCoder, an agentic framework that performs code translation by decomposing the task into specialized agents for translation, testing, and refinement, each responsible for a specific aspect such as generating code, validating correctness, or repairing errors. We evaluate BabelCoder on four benchmark datasets and compare it against four state-of-the-art baselines. BabelCoder outperforms existing methods by 0.5%-13.5% in 94% of cases, achieving an average accuracy of 94.16%.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 8 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |

While the field has evolved dramatically from rule-based systems to Transformer-based architectures, achieving performance improvements from single-digit to over 95\% success rates on benchmarks like HumanEval. In this work, we provide a comprehensive synthesis and practical guide (a series of analytic and probing experiments) about code LLMs, systematically examining the complete model life cycle from data curation to post-training through advanced prompting paradigms, code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, reinforcement learning, and autonomous coding agents. We analyze the code capability of the general LLMs (GPT-4, Claude, LLaMA) and code-specialized LLMs (StarCoder, Code LLaMA, DeepSeek-Coder, and QwenCoder), critically examining the techniques, design decisions, and trade-offs. Further, we articulate the research-practice gap between academic research (e.g., benchmarks and tasks) and real-world deployment (e.g., software-related code tasks), including code correctness, security, contextual awareness of large codebases, and integration with development workflows, and map promising research directions to practical needs. Last, we conduct a series of experiments to provide a comprehensive analysis of code pre-training, supervised fine-tuning, and reinforcement learning, covering scaling law, framework selection, hyperparameter sensitivity, model architectures, and dataset comparisons.</p></details> |  |
| **[Performance Bounds on Pliable Index Coding Using Absent Receivers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06312v1)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We characterise bounds on the optimal broadcast rate for a few classes of pliable-index-coding instances. Unlike the majority of currently solved instances, which belong to a special class where all receivers with a certain side-information cardinality are either present or absent, we consider more general instances without this constraint. We devise a novel algorithm that constructs a decoding chain by iteratively adding a message that can be decoded by a receiver whose side information is already in the chain. If the decoding chain cannot proceed due to the absence of a receiver with the required messages, we skip a message by adding it to the chain regardless. We prove that a lower bound on the optimal broadcast rate is a function of the number of skipped messages, across all possible decoding choices of the receivers and any realisation of the algorithm for each decoding choice. While this result is not computationally feasible in isolation, it serves as a basis for deriving explicit lower bounds on the broadcast rate for specific classes of pliable-index-coding instances. These lower bounds depend on the number of absent receivers or the pattern of their side-information sets. Specifically, we explicitly characterise the optimal broadcast rate for instances with up to and including four absent receivers with any side-information pattern, as well as instances where the side-information sets are nested in particular ways.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autho...</summary><p>Author's final manuscript</p></details> |

However, evaluating the quality and security of LLM-generated code remains a significant challenge. Existing evaluation protocols for Code LLMs lack both methodological rigor and comprehensive scope. A key limitation is dataset bias, which arises from unintentional overlap between training and testing data. Furthermore, while CodeBLEU, a BLEU-based metric, is widely used to assess code similarity, it suffers from critical shortcomings, including imprecise tokenization, structural limitations, and low reference diversity. To address these challenges, we introduce CFCEval, a novel framework for evaluating the quality and security of code generated by LLMs. CFCEval mitigates dataset bias by creating a new benchmark, MLVBench, and incorporates ELRM, a new metric designed to assess the relevance between reference code and generated code. CFCEval evaluates generated code across four dimensions: programming quality, vulnerability-fixing capability, post-transformation fixing capability, and relevance. Our experiments show that CFCEval not only captures both quality and security aspects of generated code more effectively but also that its ELRM aligns more closely with human judgments than CodeBLEU, thus paving the way for future advancements in Code LLMs evaluation.</p></details> |  |

In addition, as generative AI further reduces the focus on syntax and increases the importance of higher-level code reasoning, there is renewed opportunity to teach DA explicitly. In this paper, we introduce a framework for systematically assessing the complexity of code structuring tasks, where students must identify and separate meaningful abstractions within existing, unstructured code. The framework defines three dimensions of task complexity, each with multiple levels: repetition, code pattern, and data dependency. To support practical use, we provide example tasks mapped to these levels and offer an interactive tool for generating and exploring DA problems. The framework is designed to support the development of educational tasks that build students' skills with DA in the procedural paradigm.</p></details> |  |

These diverse formats test complementary reasoning skills. By leveraging the dynamic, code-driven nature of the benchmark, we introduce three novel evaluation metrics in addition to standard accuracy: Consistency Score, Failure Rate, and Confusion Rate, that quantify variability and uncertainty across problem variants. Experiments with state-of-the-art instruction-tuned language models reveal both strengths and limitations in scientific reasoning, positioning SymPyBench as a foundation for developing more robust and interpretable reasoning systems</p></details> |  |
| **[Characterization and constructions of binary self-orthogonal singly-even linear codes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.12240v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent research has focused extensively on constructing binary self-orthogonal (SO) linear codes due to their applications in quantum information theory, lattice design, and related areas. Despite significant activity, the fundamental characterization remains unchanged: binary SO codes are necessarily even (all codeword weights even), while doubly-even codes (weights divisible by 4) are automatically SO. This paper advances the theory by addressing the understudied case of singly-even (even but not doublyeven) SO codes. We first provide a complete characterization of binary SO linear codes, and a necessary and sufficient condition for binary SO singly-even linear codes is given. Moreover, we give a general approach to generating many binary SO linear codes from two known SO linear codes, yielding three infinite classes of binary SO singly-even linear codes with few weights. Note that these new codes are also minimal and violate the Aschikhmin-Barg condition. Their weight distributions are determined. Furthermore, we give a necessary and sufficient condition for a Boolean function f such that the linear code proposed from f via a well-known generic construction is SO singly-even, and a general approach to constructing Boolean functions satisfying this condition is provided, yielding several infinite classes of binary SO singly-even minimal linear codes with few weights. Finally, we would like to emphasize that using the methods in this paper, we can construct more binary linear codes that are SO, singly-even, minimal, violating the AB condition, and with few weights at the same time.</p></details> |  |
| **[Exploiting Spatial Multiplexing Based on Pixel Antennas: An Antenna Coding Approach](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05706v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>An antenna coding approach for exploiting the spatial multiplexing capability of pixel antennas is proposed. This approach can leverage additional degrees of freedom in the beamspace domain to transmit more information streams. Pixel antennas are a general reconfigurable antenna design where a radiating structure with arbitrary shape and size can be discretized into sub-wavelength elements called pixels which are connected by radio frequency switches. By controlling the switch states, the pixel antenna topology can be flexibly adjusted so that the resulting radiation pattern can be reconfigured for beamspace spatial multiplexing. In this work, we introduce the antenna coder and pattern coder for pixel antennas, provide a multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication system model with antenna coding in the beamspace domain, and derive the spectral efficiency. Utilizing the antenna coder, the radiation pattern of the pixel antenna is analyzed and efficient optimization algorithms are provided for antenna coding design. Numerical simulation results show that the proposed technique using pixel antennas can enhance spectral efficiency of 4-by-4 MIMO by up to 12 bits/s/Hz or equivalently reduce the required transmit power by up to 90% when compared to conventional MIMO, demonstrating the effectiveness of the antenna coding technique in spectral efficiency enhancement and its promise for future sixth generation (6G) wireless communication.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hyperspectral Unmixing with 3D Convolutional Sparse Coding and Projected Simplex Volume Maximization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05674v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hyperspectral unmixing (HSU) aims to separate each pixel into its constituent endmembers and estimate their corresponding abundance fractions. This work presents an algorithm-unrolling-based network for the HSU task, named the 3D Convolutional Sparse Coding Network (3D-CSCNet), built upon a 3D CSC model. Unlike existing unrolling-based networks, our 3D-CSCNet is designed within the powerful autoencoder (AE) framework. Specifically, to solve the 3D CSC problem, we propose a 3D CSC block (3D-CSCB) derived through deep algorithm unrolling. Given a hyperspectral image (HSI), 3D-CSCNet employs the 3D-CSCB to estimate the abundance matrix. The use of 3D CSC enables joint learning of spectral and spatial relationships in the 3D HSI data cube. The estimated abundance matrix is then passed to the AE decoder to reconstruct the HSI, and the decoder weights are extracted as the endmember matrix. Additionally, we propose a projected simplex volume maximization (PSVM) algorithm for endmember estimation, and the resulting endmembers are used to initialize the decoder weights of 3D-CSCNet. Extensive experiments on three real datasets and one simulated dataset with three different signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) levels demonstrate that our 3D-CSCNet outperforms state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Optimized Many-Hypercube Codes toward Lower Logical Error Rates and Earlier Realization](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.00561v3)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many-hypercube codes [H. Goto, Sci. Adv. 10, eadp6388 (2024)], concatenated ${[[n,n-2,2]]}$ quantum error-detecting codes ($n$ is even), have recently been proposed as high-rate quantum codes suitable for fault-tolerant quantum computing. While the original many-hypercube codes with ${n=6}$ can achieve remarkably high encoding rates (about 30% and 20% at concatenation levels 3 and 4, respectively), they have large code block sizes at high levels (216 and 1296 physical qubits per block at levels 3 and 4, respectively), making not only experimental realization difficult but also logical error rates per block high. Toward earlier experimental realization and lower logical error rates, here we comprehensively investigate smaller many-hypercube codes with $[[6,4,2]]$ and/or $[[4,2,2]]$ codes, where, e.g., $D_{6,4,4}$ denotes the many-hypercube code using $[[6,4,2]]$ at level 1 and $[[4,2,2]]$ at levels 2 and 3. As a result, we found a notable fact that $D_{6,4,4}$ ($D_{6,6,4,4}$) can achieve lower block error rates than $D_{4,4,4}$ ($D_{4,4,4,4}$), despite its higher encoding rate. Focusing on level 3, we also developed efficient fault-tolerant encoders realizing about 60% overhead reduction while maintaining or even improving the performance, compared to the original design. Using them, we numerically confirmed that $D_{6,4,4}$ also achieves the best performance for logical controlled-NOT gates in a circuit-level noise model. These results will be useful for early experimental realization of fault-tolerant quantum computing with high-rate quantum codes.</p></details> | 17 pages, 10 figures |

A range of methods, from simple template-based summaries to complex machine learning techniques -- and more recently, large language models -- have been employed to generate these summaries. Summarising software design patterns is important because it helps developers quickly understand and reuse complex design concepts, thereby improving software maintainability and development efficiency. However, the generation of summaries for software design patterns has not yet been explored. Our approach utilises code features and JavaParser to parse the code and create a JSON representation. Using an NLG library on this JSON representation, we convert it into natural language text that acts as a summary of the code, capturing the contextual information of the design pattern. Our empirical results indicate that the summaries generated by our approach capture the context in which patterns are applied in the codebase. Statistical evaluations demonstrate that our summaries closely align with human-written summaries, as evident from high values in the ROUGE-L, BLEU-4, NIST, and FrugalScore metrics. A follow-up survey further shows that DPS summaries were rated as capturing context better than human-generated summaries. Additionally, a time based task activity shows that summaries increase the time of understanding of design pattern for developer better than when the summaries are not present.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 2 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |
| **[CodeNER: Code Prompting for Named Entity Recognition](https://arxiv.org/abs/2507.20423v2)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent studies have explored various approaches for treating candidate named entity spans as both source and target sequences in named entity recognition (NER) by leveraging large language models (LLMs). Although previous approaches have successfully generated candidate named entity spans with suitable labels, they rely solely on input context information when using LLMs, particularly, ChatGPT. However, NER inherently requires capturing detailed labeling requirements with input context information. To address this issue, we propose a novel method that leverages code-based prompting to improve the capabilities of LLMs in understanding and performing NER. By embedding code within prompts, we provide detailed BIO schema instructions for labeling, thereby exploiting the ability of LLMs to comprehend long-range scopes in programming languages. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed code-based prompting method outperforms conventional text-based prompting on ten benchmarks across English, Arabic, Finnish, Danish, and German datasets, indicating the effectiveness of explicitly structuring NER instructions. We also verify that combining the proposed code-based prompting method with the chain-of-thought prompting further improves performance.</p></details> | 18 pages, 6 figures |

Yet, as external threats such as software supply chain attacks on project health and quality assurance increase, mechanisms for assigning and enforcing responsibility have become increasingly critical. In 2017, GitHub introduced the CODEOWNERS feature, which automatically designates reviewers for specific files to strengthen accountability and protect critical parts of the codebase. Despite its potential, little is known about how CODEOWNERS is actually adopted and practiced. We present the first large-scale empirical study of CODEOWNERS usage across over 844,000 pull requests with 1.9 million comments and over 2 million reviews. We identify 10,287 code owners to track their review activities. Results indicate that codeowners tend to adhere the rules specified in the CODEOWNERS file, exhibit similar collaborative behaviours to traditional metrics of ownership, but tend to contribute to a smoother and faster PR workflow over time. Finally, using regression discontinuity design (RDD) analysis, we find that repositories adopting CODEOWNERS experience shifts in review dynamics, as ownership redistributes review responsibilities away from core developers. Our results position CODEOWNERS as a promising yet underutilized mechanism for improving software governance and resilience. We discuss how projects can leverage this alternative ownership method as a perspective to enhance security, accountability, and workflow efficiency in open-source development.</p></details> | <details><summary>15 pa...</summary><p>15 pages, 9 figures, 8 tables</p></details> |

The former provides correctness guarantees but are rigid for complex requirements, whereas LLMs offer high flexibility at the risk of producing faulty code.This paper proposes iEcoreGen, a hybrid approach that integrates Eclipse Modeling Framework (EMF) and LLMs. In EMF, an Ecore model defines a system structure and acts as a blueprint for code-generation.iEcoreGen decomposes requirements to derive operation specifications, uses EMF's template-based generator to produce initial Java code, and serializes specifications into docstrings. LLMs are then invoked to complete and fix unimplemented methods. We assessed iEcoreGen on twenty code-generation tasks across five LLMs. It surpasses LLM-only baselines on pass@k and performs on par with them on compilation@k. An ablation study clarified the contribution of each component of iEcoreGen. Overall, the findings indicate that LLM-enhanced model-driven development is a promising path toward more efficient software automation.</p></details> |  |
| **[PrivCode: When Code Generation Meets Differential Privacy](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05459v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have presented outstanding performance in code generation and completion. However, fine-tuning these models on private datasets can raise privacy and proprietary concerns, such as the leakage of sensitive personal information. Differentially private (DP) code generation provides theoretical guarantees for protecting sensitive code by generating synthetic datasets that preserve statistical properties while reducing privacy leakage concerns. However, DP code generation faces significant challenges due to the strict syntactic dependencies and the privacy-utility trade-off. We propose PrivCode, the first DP synthesizer specifically designed for code datasets. It incorporates a two-stage framework to improve both privacy and utility. In the first stage, termed "privacy-sanitizing", PrivCode generates DP-compliant synthetic code by training models using DP-SGD while introducing syntactic information to preserve code structure. The second stage, termed "utility-boosting", fine-tunes a larger pre-trained LLM on the synthetic privacy-free code to mitigate the utility loss caused by DP, enhancing the utility of the generated code. Extensive experiments on four LLMs show that PrivCode generates higher-utility code across various testing tasks under four benchmarks. The experiments also confirm its ability to protect sensitive data under varying privacy budgets. We provide the replication package at the anonymous link.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at NDSS 2026; code available at https://github.com/Liuzzyg/PrivCode</p></details> |

To enhance the reliability of operation code generated by LLMs, corrective designs with feedback from the observation of executing code have been increasingly adopted in existing research. However, the code execution in these designs relies on either a physical experiment or a customized simulation environment, which limits their deployment due to the high configuration effort of the environment and the potential long execution time. In this paper, we explore the possibility of directly leveraging LLM to enable static simulation of robot operation code, and then leverage it to design a new reliable LLM-driven corrective robot operation code generation framework. Our framework configures the LLM as a static simulator with enhanced capabilities that reliably simulate robot code execution by interpreting actions, reasoning over state transitions, analyzing execution outcomes, and generating semantic observations that accurately capture trajectory dynamics. To validate the performance of our framework, we performed experiments on various operation tasks for different robots, including UAVs and small ground vehicles. The experiment results not only demonstrated the high accuracy of our static text-based simulation but also the reliable code generation of our LLM-driven corrective framework, which achieves a comparable performance with state-of-the-art research while does not rely on dynamic code execution using physical experiments or simulators.</p></details> | 8 pages, 2 figures |
| **[Auto-SPT: Automating Semantic Preserving Transformations for Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.06042v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Machine learning (ML) models for code clone detection determine whether two pieces of code are semantically equivalent, which in turn is a key building block for software-engineering tasks like refactoring and security tasks like vulnerability and malware detection. While these models are predominantly trained on clean, structured code datasets, real-world code often undergoes a variety of semantic-preserving transformations, including refactoring, minification, automated formatting, and compiler optimizations. To address this critical gap between training and test data, we propose Auto-SPT, a novel framework to automatically construct synthetic-data generators for code. Auto-SPT is designed to produce Semantic Preserving Transformations (SPTs) that alter a program's syntactic structure while preserving its functionality and is instantiated on top of Large Language Models (LLMs). In particular, we use LLMs to craft a diverse set of SPTs, generate strong implementations for these SPTs, and compose them to result into strong transformations. Our formal analysis shows that the diversity of SPTs impacts the strength of their composition. We then empirically demonstrate that Auto-SPT generates more diverse SPTs than existing approaches and these SPTs significantly drop the performance of state-of-the-art code clone detectors. Further experiments show Auto-SPT can be used to enhance code datasets for training, to produce code-clone detection models that are robust to real-world, adversarial code transformations.</p></details> |  |

However, building agents for these tasks faces a critical bottleneck: the reliance on ever-expanding interaction history incurs substantial context overhead. Existing context management and compression techniques often fail to preserve vital semantic information, leading to degraded task performance. We propose AgentProg, a program-guided approach for agent context management that reframes the interaction history as a program with variables and control flow. By organizing information according to the structure of program, this structure provides a principled mechanism to determine which information should be retained and which can be discarded. We further integrate a global belief state mechanism inspired by Belief MDP framework to handle partial observability and adapt to unexpected environmental changes. Experiments on AndroidWorld and our extended long-horizon task suite demonstrate that AgentProg has achieved the state-of-the-art success rates on these benchmarks. More importantly, it maintains robust performance on long-horizon tasks while baseline methods experience catastrophic degradation. Our system is open-sourced at https://github.com/MobileLLM/AgentProg.</p></details> | 16 pages, 8 figures |

Prior LLM approaches either rely on brittle prompting or costly retraining with limited generalization. We present AlphaOPT, a self-improving experience library that enables an LLM to learn from limited demonstrations (even answers alone, without gold-standard programs) and solver feedback - without annotated reasoning traces or parameter updates. AlphaOPT operates in a continual two-phase cycle: (i) a Library Learning phase that reflects on failed attempts, extracting solver-verified, structured insights as {taxonomy, condition, explanation, example}; and (ii) a Library Evolution phase that diagnoses retrieval misalignments and refines the applicability conditions of stored insights, improving transfer across tasks. This design (1) learns efficiently from limited demonstrations without curated rationales, (2) expands continually without costly retraining by updating the library rather than model weights, and (3) makes knowledge explicit and interpretable for human inspection and intervention. Experiments show that AlphaOPT steadily improves with more data (65% to 72% from 100 to 300 training items) and surpasses the strongest baseline by 7.7% on the out-of-distribution OptiBench dataset when trained only on answers. Code and data are available at: https://github.com/Minw913/AlphaOPT.</p></details> |  |
| **[SemanticBBV: A Semantic Signature for Cross-Program Knowledge Reuse in Microarchitecture Simulation](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10231v1)** | 2025-12-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For decades, sampling-based techniques have been the de facto standard for accelerating microarchitecture simulation, with the Basic Block Vector (BBV) serving as the cornerstone program representation. Yet, the BBV's fundamental limitations: order-dependent IDs that prevent cross-program knowledge reuse and a lack of semantic content predictive of hardware performance have left a massive potential for optimization untapped. To address these gaps, we introduce SemanticBBV, a novel, two-stage framework that generates robust, performance-aware signatures for cross-program simulation reuse. First, a lightweight RWKV-based semantic encoder transforms assembly basic blocks into rich Basic Block Embeddings (BBEs), capturing deep functional semantics. Second, an order-invariant Set Transformer aggregates these BBEs, weighted by execution frequency, into a final signature. Crucially, this stage is co-trained with a dual objective: a triplet loss for signature distinctiveness and a Cycles Per Instruction (CPI) regression task, directly imbuing the signature with performance sensitivity. Our evaluation demonstrates that SemanticBBV not only matches traditional BBVs in single-program accuracy but also enables unprecedented cross-program analysis. By simulating just 14 universal program points, we estimated the performance of ten SPEC CPU benchmarks with 86.3% average accuracy, achieving a 7143x simulation speedup. Furthermore, the signature shows strong adaptability to new microarchitectures with minimal fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted by ASP-DAC 2026 conference</p></details> |

Predict-and-Search methods operate by using a predictive model to estimate promising variable assignments and then guiding a search procedure toward high-quality solutions. Recent research has demonstrated that incorporating machine learning (ML) into the Predict-and-Search framework significantly enhances its performance. Still, it is restricted to binary problems and overlooks the presence of fixed variables that commonly arise in practical settings. This work extends the Predict-and-Search (PaS) framework to parametric MIPs and introduces ID-PaS, an identity-aware learning framework that enables the ML model to handle heterogeneous variables more effectively. Experiments on several real-world large-scale problems demonstrate that ID-PaS consistently achieves superior performance compared to the state-of-the-art solver Gurobi and PaS.</p></details> |  |
| **[Universal Hirschberg for Width Bounded Dynamic Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.10132v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Hirschberg's algorithm (1975) reduces the space complexity for the longest common subsequence problem from $O(N^2)$ to $O(N)$ via recursive midpoint bisection on a grid dynamic program (DP). We show that the underlying idea generalizes to a broad class of dynamic programs with local dependencies on directed acyclic graphs (DP DAGs). Modeling a DP as deterministic time evolution over a topologically ordered DAG with frontier width $ω$ and bounded in-degree, and assuming a max-type semiring with deterministic tie breaking, we prove that in a standard offline random-access model any such DP admits deterministic traceback in space $O(ω\log T + (\log T)^{O(1)})$ cells over a fixed finite alphabet, where $T$ is the number of states. Our construction replaces backward dynamic programs by forward-only recomputation and organizes the time order into a height-compressed recursion tree whose nodes expose small "middle frontiers'' across which every optimal path must pass. The framework yields near-optimal traceback bounds for asymmetric and banded sequence alignment, one-dimensional recurrences, and dynamic-programming formulations on graphs of bounded pathwidth. We also show that an $Ω(ω)$ space term (in bits) is unavoidable in forward single-pass models and discuss conjectured $\sqrt{T}$-type barriers in streaming settings, supporting the view that space-efficient traceback is a structural property of width-bounded DP DAGs rather than a peculiarity of grid-based algorithms.</p></details> | 31 pages |

Human visual attention refers to the mechanical processes by which we selectively process and prioritize information. Visual attention is important to study because it is central to what information people (who are sighted) use to solve a particular problem. Meanwhile, memory bugs are among the most common types of bugs in C programs that manifest as a variety of program faults. In this paper, we study human visual attention while people attempt to locate memory bugs in code. We recruit 21 programmers to locate between one and eight memory bugs in three C programs for 1.5-2 hours each. In total we collected observations of 31 hours of programmer effort. The bugs in our study cover memory leaks, overflows, and double frees, which are among the most common memory bugs. We analyze the task outcomes in terms of success rate and related factors, patterns of visual attention overall such as what lines and functions are read, and finally we explore differences of visual attention patterns during success versus failure cases.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rule-Based Graph Programs Matching the Time Complexity of Imperative Algorithms](https://arxiv.org/abs/2501.09144v3)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We report on recent advances in rule-based graph programming, which allow us to match the time complexity of some fundamental imperative graph algorithms. In general, achieving the time complexity of graph algorithms implemented in conventional languages using a rule-based graph-transformation language is challenging due to the cost of graph matching. Previous work demonstrated that with rooted rules, certain algorithms can be implemented in the graph programming language GP 2 such that their runtime matches the time complexity of imperative implementations. However, this required input graphs to have a bounded node degree and (for some algorithms) to be connected. In this paper, we overcome these limitations by enhancing the graph data structure generated by the GP 2 compiler and exploiting the new structure in programs. We present three case studies: the first program checks whether input graphs are connected, the second program checks whether input graphs are acyclic, and the third program solves the single-source shortest-paths problem for graphs with integer edge-weights. The first two programs run in linear time on (possibly disconnected) input graphs with arbitrary node degrees. The third program runs in time $O(nm)$ on arbitrary input graphs, matching the time complexity of imperative implementations of the Bellman-Ford algorithm. For each program, we formally prove its correctness and time complexity, and provide runtime experiments on various graph classes.</p></details> | LMCS |
| **[Simple Modal Types for Functional Reactive Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.09412v1)** | 2025-12-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Functional reactive programming (FRP) is a declarative programming paradigm for implementing reactive programs at a high level of abstraction. It applies functional programming principles to construct and manipulate time-varying values, also known as signals. However, for this programming paradigm to work in practice, an FRP language must ensure that programs are causal, productive, and free from space leaks. Over the past fifteen years, several modal type systems to enforce these operational properties have been developed. We present a new FRP language with a significantly simplified modal type system that imposes fewer restrictions than previous modal FRP languages while still guaranteeing the central operational properties of causality, productivity, and absence of space leaks. The key enabling idea is to alter the semantics of signals so that the type system can safely allow more programs to type-check, which also makes the language more expressive. With this new semantics, signals are modelled as mutable references whose mutability is tightly controlled by the 'later' type modality. This disciplined form of mutability also enables more efficient in-place updates of signals, all while preserving a functional programming style.</p></details> |  |

(2025), this paper proposes FLARE v2 as a recursive, semiotically informed account of how program meaning is constructed. It reinterprets the descriptive tiers of FLARE v1 as instances of a single generative operation: identify elements (characterised by the four properties Receives, Sends, Effects, Shares); analyse their bindings along two dimensions (Causal-Temporal and Communicative); and recognise the new element that emerges. The Causal-Temporal dimension encompasses three subtypes - Sequential, Branch, and Event - that together account for control flow in both procedural and event-driven environments. A Compositional Ladder provides a visual parallel between literacy progressions and programming structures, illustrating how recursive composition operates from blocks and statements through segments, systems, and services. The framework aims to address conceptual and cognitive-load limitations reported in FLARE v1 and is situated within semiotic and program-comprehension theory. FLARE v2 is presented as a conceptual lens with potential implications for pedagogy and curriculum design; implementation and empirical evaluation are left for future work.</p></details> | <details><summary>22 pa...</summary><p>22 pages, 4 figures.

While Large Language Models (LLMs) show promise for RTL automation, their performance and research focus have overwhelmingly centered on RTL generation rather than verification. Current methods for RTL verification rely on large scale proprietary models (e.g., GPT-4o) to generate Python-based functional references, incurring a high cost and raising data-privacy risks. To date, an end-to-end open-source solution for autonomous verification remains absent. We introduce PRO-V-R1, the first trainable open-source agentic framework for autonomous RTL verification. Our contributions are threefold: (1) we design PRO-V sys, a modular agentic system that couples LLM-based reasoning with programmatic tool use for RTL verification; (2) we establish a data construction pipeline that leverages existing RTL datasets to build simulation-validated, expert-level trajectories tailored for supervised fine-tuning (SFT) RTL verification agents; and (3) we implement an efficient reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that uses verification-specific rewards derived from program-tool feedback to optimize the end-to-end verification workflow. Our empirical evaluation demonstrates PRO-V-R1 achieves a 57.7% functional correctness rate and 34.0% in robust fault detection, significantly outperforming the base model's 25.7% and 21.8% (respectively) from the state-of-the-art (SOTA) automatic verification system. This configuration also outperforms large-scale proprietary LLMs in functional correctness and shows comparable robustness for fault detection.</p></details> |  |

State-of-the-art points-to analyses guarantee sound solutions only for complete programs, requiring summary functions to describe any missing program parts. Summary functions are rarely available in production compilers, however, where soundness and efficiency are non-negotiable. This paper presents an Andersen-style points-to analysis that efficiently produces sound solutions for incomplete C programs. The analysis accomplishes soundness by tracking memory locations and pointers that are accessible from external modules, and efficiency by performing this tracking implicitly in the constraint graph. We show that implicit pointee tracking makes the constraint solver 15$\times$ faster than any combination of five different state-of-the-art techniques using explicit pointee tracking. We also present the Prefer Implicit Pointees (PIP) technique that further reduces the use of explicit pointees. PIP gives an additional speedup of 1.9$\times$, compared to the fastest solver configuration not benefiting from PIP. The precision of the analysis is evaluated in terms of an alias-analysis client, where it reduces the number of MayAlias-responses by 40% compared to LLVM's BasicAA pass alone. Finally, we show that the analysis is scalable in terms of memory, making it suitable for optimizing compilers in practice.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 10 figures.

We propose a novel framework leveraging Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to evaluate multiple dimensions of fairness-Priority, Access, and Outcome-within a unified model. This approach captures complexities often missed in single-metric analyses. Using data from the United Network for Organ Sharing, we separately quantify fairness across these dimensions: Priority fairness through waitlist durations, Access fairness via the Living Kidney Donor Profile Index (LKDPI) scores, and Outcome fairness based on graft lifespan. We then apply our conditional DEA model with covariate adjustment to demonstrate significant disparities in kidney allocation efficiency across ethnic groups. To quantify uncertainty, we employ conformal prediction within a novel Reference Frontier Mapping (RFM) framework, yielding group-conditional prediction intervals with finite-sample coverage guarantees. Our findings show notable differences in efficiency distributions between ethnic groups. Our study provides a rigorous framework for evaluating fairness in complex resource allocation systems with resource scarcity and mutual compatibility constraints.</p></details> |  |
| **[A biconvex optimization for solving semidefinite programs via bilinear factorization](https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01198v13)** | 2025-12-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Many problems in machine learning can be reduced to learning a low-rank positive semidefinite matrix (denoted as $Z$), which encounters semidefinite program (SDP). Existing SDP solvers by classical convex optimization are expensive to solve large-scale problems. Employing the low rank of solution, Burer-Monteiro's method reformulated SDP as a nonconvex problem via the {\emph{quadratic}} factorization ($Z$ as $XX^\top$). However, this would lose the structure of problem in optimization. In this paper, we propose to convert SDP into a biconvex problem via the {\emph{bilinear}} factorization ($Z$ as $XY^\top$), and while adding the term $\frac{\g}{2}\normfs{X-Y}$ to penalize the difference of $X$ and $Y$. Thus, the biconvex structure (w.r.t. $X$ and $Y$) can be exploited naturally in optimization. As a theoretical result, we provide a bound to the penalty parameter $\g$ under the assumption of $L$-Lipschitz smoothness and $σ$-strongly biconvexity, such that, at stationary points, the proposed bilinear factorization is equivalent to Burer-Monteiro's factorization when the bound is arrived, that is $\g>\frac{1}{4}(L-σ)_+$.

Existing learning-based methods like Neural Two-Stage Stochastic Programming (Neur2SP) employ neural networks (NNs) as recourse function surrogates but rely on computationally intensive mixed-integer programming (MIP) formulations. We propose ICNN-enhanced 2SP, a method that leverages Input Convex Neural Networks (ICNNs) to exploit linear programming (LP) representability in convex 2SP problems. By architecturally enforcing convexity and enabling exact inference through LP, our approach eliminates the need for integer variables inherent to the conventional MIP-based formulation while retaining an exact embedding of the ICNN surrogate within the 2SP framework. This results in a more computationally efficient alternative, and we show that good solution quality can be maintained. Comprehensive experiments reveal that ICNNs incur only marginally longer training times while achieving validation accuracy on par with their standard NN counterparts. Across benchmark problems, ICNN-enhanced 2SP often exhibits considerably faster solution times than the MIP-based formulations while preserving solution quality, with these advantages becoming significantly more pronounced as problem scale increases. For the most challenging instances, the method achieves speedups of up to 100$\times$ and solution quality superior to MIP-based formulations.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Dynamic Programming Theory for Leader-Follower Stochastic Games](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.05667v1)** | 2025-12-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Leader-follower general-sum stochastic games (LF-GSSGs) model sequential decision-making under asymmetric commitment, where a leader commits to a policy and a follower best responds, yielding a strong Stackelberg equilibrium (SSE) with leader-favourable tie-breaking. This paper introduces a dynamic programming (DP) framework that applies Bellman recursion over credible sets-state abstractions formally representing all rational follower best responses under partial leader commitments-to compute SSEs. We first prove that any LF-GSSG admits a lossless reduction to a Markov decision process (MDP) over credible sets. We further establish that synthesising an optimal memoryless deterministic leader policy is NP-hard, motivating the development of ε-optimal DP algorithms with provable guarantees on leader exploitability. Experiments on standard mixed-motive benchmarks-including security games, resource allocation, and adversarial planning-demonstrate empirical gains in leader value and runtime scalability over state-of-the-art methods.</p></details> | 31 pages, 5 figures |

Currently, low-code/no-code platforms are widely used to enable end-user development through visual programming, minimizing the need for manual coding. Recent advancements in generative AI, particularly large language model-based assistants and "copilots", open new possibilities, as they may enable end users to generate and refine programming code and build apps directly from natural language prompts. This approach, here referred to as AI-assisted end-user coding, promises greater flexibility, broader applicability, faster development, improved reusability, and reduced vendor lock-in compared to the established visual LCNC platforms. This paper investigates whether AI-assisted end-user coding is a feasible paradigm for end-user development, which may complement or even replace the LCNC model in the future. To explore this, we conducted a case study in which non-programmers were asked to develop a basic web app through interaction with AI assistants.The majority of study participants successfully completed the task in reasonable time and also expressed support for AI-assisted end-user coding as a viable approach for end-user development. The paper presents the study design, analyzes the outcomes, and discusses potential implications for practice, future research, and academic teaching.</p></details> | 12 pages, 3 figures |

Many LCP tools have rapidly evolved and have benefited from the concepts of visual programming languages (VPLs) and programming by demonstration (PBD). With the huge increase in interest in using large language models (LLMs) in software engineering, LLM-based LCP has begun to become increasingly important. However, the technical principles and application scenarios of traditional approaches to LCP and LLM-based LCP are significantly different. Understanding these key differences and characteristics in the application of the two approaches to LCP by users is crucial for LCP providers in improving existing and developing new LCP tools and in better assisting users in choosing the appropriate LCP technology. We conducted an empirical study of both traditional LCP and LLM-based LCP. We analyzed developers' discussions on Stack Overflow (SO) over the past three years and then explored the similarities and differences between traditional LCP and LLM-based LCP features and developer feedback. Our findings reveal that while traditional LCP and LLM-based LCP share common primary usage scenarios, they significantly differ in scope, limitations, and usage throughout the software development lifecycle, particularly during the implementation phase. We also examine how LLMs impact and integrate with LCP, discussing the latest technological developments in LLM-based LCP, such as its integration with VPLs and the application of LLM Agents in software engineering.</p></details> |  |

| **[On-Policy Optimization with Group Equivalent Preference for Multi-Programming Language Understanding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.12723v3)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) achieve remarkable performance in code generation tasks. However, a significant performance disparity persists between popular programming languages (e.g., Python, C++) and others. To address this capability gap, we leverage the code translation task to train LLMs, thereby facilitating the transfer of coding proficiency across diverse programming languages. Moreover, we introduce OORL for training, a novel reinforcement learning (RL) framework that integrates on-policy and off-policy strategies. Within OORL, on-policy RL is applied during code translation, guided by a rule-based reward signal derived from unit tests. Complementing this coarse-grained rule-based reward, we propose Group Equivalent Preference Optimization (GEPO), a novel preference optimization method. Specifically, GEPO trains the LLM using intermediate representations (IRs) groups. LLMs can be guided to discern IRs equivalent to the source code from inequivalent ones, while also utilizing signals about the mutual equivalence between IRs within the group. This process allows LLMs to capture nuanced aspects of code functionality. By employing OORL for training with code translation tasks, LLMs improve their recognition of code functionality and their understanding of the relationships between code implemented in different languages. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our OORL for LLMs training with code translation tasks achieves significant performance improvements on code benchmarks across multiple programming languages.</p></details> |  |
| **[Reflection-Satisfaction Tradeoff: Investigating Impact of Reflection on Student Engagement with AI-Generated Programming Hints](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.04630v1)** | 2025-12-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Generative AI tools, such as AI-generated hints, are increasingly integrated into programming education to offer timely, personalized support. However, little is known about how to effectively leverage these hints while ensuring autonomous and meaningful learning. One promising approach involves pairing AI-generated hints with reflection prompts, asking students to review and analyze their learning, when they request hints. This study investigates the interplay between AI-generated hints and different designs of reflection prompts in an online introductory programming course. We conducted a two-trial field experiment. In Trial 1, students were randomly assigned to receive prompts either before or after receiving hints, or no prompt at all. Each prompt also targeted one of three SRL phases: planning, monitoring, and evaluation. In Trial 2, we examined two types of prompt guidance: directed (offering more explicit and structured guidance) and open (offering more general and less constrained guidance). Findings show that students in the before-hint (RQ1), planning (RQ2), and directed (RQ3) prompt groups produced higher-quality reflections but reported lower satisfaction with AI-generated hints than those in other conditions. Immediate performance did not differ across conditions. This negative relationship between reflection quality and hint satisfaction aligns with previous work on student mental effort and satisfaction. Our results highlight the need to reconsider how AI models are trained and evaluated for education, as prioritizing user satisfaction can undermine deeper learning.</p></details> | Preprint |

Unlike binary matrix factorization based on standard arithmetic, BMF employs the Boolean OR and AND operations for the matrix product, which improves interpretability and reduces the approximation error. It is also used in role mining and computer vision. In this paper, we first propose algorithms for BMF that perform alternating optimization (AO) of the factor matrices, where each subproblem is solved via integer programming (IP). We then design different approaches to further enhance AO-based algorithms by selecting an optimal subset of rank-one factors from multiple runs. To address the scalability limits of IP-based methods, we introduce new greedy and local-search heuristics. We also construct a new C++ data structure for Boolean vectors and matrices that is significantly faster than existing ones and is of independent interest, allowing our heuristics to scale to large datasets. We illustrate the performance of all our proposed methods and compare them with the state of the art on various real datasets, both with and without missing data, including applications in topic modeling and imaging.</p></details> | <details><summary>24 pa...</summary><p>24 pages, 12 tables, 3 figures, 2 typos corrected in v2, code and data available from https://gitlab.com/ckolomvakis/boolean-matrix-factorization-ip-and-heuristics</p></details> |

We present a unified taxonomy that groups 62 recent LLM-based repair systems into four paradigms defined by parameter adaptation and control authority over the repair loop, and overlays two cross-cutting layers for retrieval and analysis augmentation. Prior surveys have either focused on classical software repair techniques, on LLMs in software engineering more broadly, or on subsets of LLM-based software repair, such as fine-tuning strategies or vulnerability repair. We complement these works by treating fine-tuning, prompting, procedural pipelines, and agentic frameworks as first-class paradigms and systematically mapping representative systems to each of these paradigms. We also consolidate evaluation practice on common benchmarks by recording benchmark scope, pass@k, and fault-localization assumptions to support a more meaningful comparison of reported success rates. We clarify trade-offs among paradigms in task alignment, deployment cost, controllability, and ability to repair multi-hunk or cross-file bugs. We discuss challenges in current LLM-based software repair and outline research directions. Our artifacts, including the representation papers and scripted survey pipeline, are publicly available at https://github.com/GLEAM-Lab/ProgramRepair.</p></details> |  |
| **[New Perspectives on Semiring Applications to Dynamic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03916v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Semiring algebras have been shown to provide a suitable language to formalize many noteworthy combinatorial problems. For instance, the Shortest-Path problem can be seen as a special case of the Algebraic-Path problem when applied to the tropical semiring. The application of semirings typically makes it possible to solve extended problems without increasing the computational complexity. In this article we further exploit the idea of using semiring algebras to address and tackle several extensions of classical computational problems by dynamic programming. We consider a general approach which allows us to define a semiring extension of any problem with a reasonable notion of a certificate (e.g., an NP problem). This allows us to consider cost variants of these combinatorial problems, as well as their counting extensions where the goal is to determine how many solutions a given problem admits. The approach makes no particular assumptions (such as idempotence) on the semiring structure. We also propose a new associative algebraic operation on semirings, called $Δ$-product, which enables our dynamic programming algorithms to count the number of solutions of minimal costs. We illustrate the advantages of our framework on two well-known but computationally very different NP-hard problems, namely, Connected-Dominating-Set problems and finite-domain Constraint Satisfaction Problems (CSPs). In particular, we prove fixed parameter tractability (FPT) with respect to clique-width and tree-width of the input. This also allows us to count solutions of minimal cost, which is an overlooked problem in the literature.</p></details> |  |

Current approaches to agent programming often entangle two aspects of agent design: the core workflow logic and the inference-time strategy (e.g., tree search). We introduce "probabilistic angelic nondeterminism" ("PAN"), a programming model that disentangles these two concerns, allowing the programmer to describe the agent workflow and independently experiment with different inference-time strategies by simply changing a few inputs. We provide an implementation of PAN in Python as the EnCompass framework, which uses a Python decorator to compile agent workflow programs into a search space. We present three case studies that demonstrate how the framework lets the programmer quickly improve the reliability of an agent and easily switch between different inference-time strategies, all with little additional coding.</p></details> | <details><summary>65 pa...</summary><p>65 pages, 2 figures, published in NeurIPS 2025</p></details> |
| **[Functional Python Programming in Introductory Computer Science Courses](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.03492v1)** | 2025-12-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The functional programming paradigm has a long and storied history, with its beginnings in the Lambda Calculus. In recent decades, pure functional languages such as Haskell have been shown to be highly effective in producing robust software due to immutable data structures, among other functional features. The advantages of programming with immutable data structures can also be had in non-functional languages such as Python. Over the years, non-functional languages have introduced immutable data structures as well as comprehension and lambda expressions, and it is possible to program in a purely functional style in them. In this paper, we present a ``best practice'' idea in introductory programming classes that forces students to learn and complete programming assignments in a purely functional subset of Python. By doing so, the student can learn functional ideas such as immutability, pure functions with no side effects, and stateless programming. We define a functional subset of Python and illustrate the best practice using small examples. We strongly feel that students in computing need familiarity with pure functional programming and argue that this can be taught in introductory programming courses that use Python.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented in Best Practices Track of COMPUTE 2025 (arXiv:2512.02349)</p></details> |

Traditional methods like Spectrum-Based Fault Localization (SBFL) and Mutation-Based Fault Localization (MBFL) help identify faults but often lack the ability to understand code context, making them less effective for beginners. In recent years, Large Language Models (LLMs) have shown promise in overcoming these limitations by utilizing their ability to understand program syntax and semantics. LLM-based fault localization provides more accurate and context-aware results than traditional techniques. This study evaluates six closed-source and seven open-source LLMs using the Codeflaws, Condefects, and BugT datasets, with BugT being a newly constructed dataset specifically designed to mitigate data leakage concerns. Advanced models with reasoning capabilities, such as OpenAI o3 and DeepSeekR1, achieve superior accuracy with minimal reliance on prompt engineering. In contrast, models without reasoning capabilities, like GPT-4, require carefully designed prompts to maintain performance. While LLMs perform well in simple fault localization, their accuracy decreases as problem difficulty increases, though top models maintain robust performance in the BugT dataset. Over-reasoning is another challenge, where some models generate excessive explanations that hinder fault localization clarity. Additionally, the computational cost of deploying LLMs remains a significant barrier for real-time debugging. LLM's explanations demonstrate significant value for novice programmer assistance, with one-year experience participants consistently rating them highly. Our findings demonstrate the potential of LLMs to improve debugging efficiency while stressing the need for further refinement in their reasoning and computational efficiency for practical adoption.</p></details> | <details><summary>The p...</summary><p>The paper has been accepted for publication in The Journal of Systems & Software</p></details> |

| **[Probabilistic energy profiler for statically typed JVM-based programming languages](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.02738v1)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy consumption is a growing concern in several fields, from mobile devices to large data centers. Developers need detailed data on the energy consumption of their software to mitigate consumption issues. Previous approaches have a broader focus, such as on specific functions or programs, rather than source code statements. They primarily focus on estimating the CPU's energy consumption using point estimates, thereby disregarding other hardware effects and limiting their use for statistical reasoning and explainability. We developed a novel methodology to address the limitations of measuring only the CPU's consumption and using point estimates, focusing on predicting the energy usage of statically typed JVM-based programming languages, such as Java and Scala. We measure the energy consumption of Bytecode patterns, the translation from the programming language's source code statement to their Java Bytecode representation. With the energy measurements, we construct a statistical model using Bayesian statistics, which allows us to predict the energy consumption through statistical distributions and analyze individual factors. The model includes three factors we obtain statically from the code: data size, data type, operation, and one factor about the hardware platform the code executes on: device. To validate our methodology, we implemented it for Java and evaluated its energy predictions on unseen programs. We observe that all four factors are influential, notably that two devices of the same model may differ in energy consumption and that the operations and data types cause consumption differences. The experiments also show that the energy prediction of programs closely follows the program's real energy consumption, validating our approach. Our work presents a methodology for constructing an energy model that future work, such as verification tools, can use for their energy estimates.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bounded Exhaustive Random Program Generation for Testing Solidity Compilers](https://arxiv.org/abs/2503.20332v7)** | 2025-12-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>By July 2025, smart contracts collectively manage roughly $120 billion in assets. With Solidity remaining the dominant language for smart contract development, the correctness of Solidity compilers has become critically important. However, Solidity compilers are bug-prone, with a recent study revealing that combinations of qualifiers in Solidity programs are the primary cause of compiler crashes, accounting for 40.5% of all historical crashes. While random program generators are widely used for compiler testing, they may be less effective at finding Solidity compiler bugs because they explore the unbounded space of possible programs rather than concentrating on the specific subspace related to bug-prone qualifiers. A promising idea for finding qualifier-related bugs is to bound the search space based on empirical evidence of where such bugs are likely to occur, specifically focusing test generation to target subspaces with rich combinations of qualifiers. To address this, we propose bounded exhaustive random program generation, a novel approach that dynamically bounds the search space, enhancing the likelihood of uncovering Solidity compiler bugs. Specifically, our method bounds the search space by generating valid program templates that abstract programs that use bug-prone qualifiers, and then uses these templates as a basis for compiler testing through exhaustive enumeration of suitable qualifiers. Mechanisms are devised to address technical challenges regarding validity and efficiency. We have implemented our novel generation approach in a new tool, Erwin. We have used Erwin to find and report 26 bugs across two Solidity compilers, solc and solang, and one Solidity static analyzer, slither. Among these, 23 were previously unknown, 18 have been confirmed, and 10 have been fixed. Evaluation results demonstrate that Erwin outperforms state-of-the-art Solidity fuzzers in bug detection.</p></details> |  |

We first show some properties of the vertices of the associated polytope, which are then used to decompose the problem into instances of the multidimensional knapsack cover problem with a single continuous variable per dimension. The proposed decomposition is used to design a polynomial-time approximation scheme for the problem with a fixed number of constraints. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approximation scheme for such a general class of covering mixed-integer programs. Moreover, we design a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme and an approximate linear programming formulation for the case with a single constraint. These results improve upon the previously best-known 2-approximation algorithm for the knapsack cover problem with a single continuous variable. Finally, we show a perfect compact formulation for the case where all variables have the same lower and upper bounds. Analogous results are derived for the packing and assignment variants of the problem.</p></details> | 20 pages |

Importantly, the language captures not just qubit operations, but qudit operations for any dimension $d$. Throughout the paper we explore what it means to program with projective Cliffords through a number of examples and a case study focusing on stabilizer error correcting codes.</p></details> | 44 pages |

The study aims to validate the use of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for extracting structural feature embeddings from MILP instances, using the air05 crew scheduling problem. The MILP instance was transformed into a heterogeneous bipartite graph to model relationships between variables and constraints. Two neural architectures, Graph Convolutional Networks (GCN) and Graph Attention Networks (GAT) were trained to generate node embeddings. These representations were evaluated using Instance Space Analysis (ISA) through linear (PCA) and non-linear (UMAP, t-SNE) dimensionality reduction techniques. Analysis revealed that PCA failed to distinguish cluster structures, necessitating non-linear reductions to visualize the embedding topology. The GCN architecture demonstrated superior performance, capturing global topology with well-defined clusters for both variables and constraints. In contrast, the GAT model failed to organize the constraint space. The findings confirm that simpler graph architectures can effectively map the sparse topology of aviation logistics problems without manual feature engineering, contributing to explainability of instance complexity. This structural awareness provides a validated foundation for developing future Learning to Optimize (L2O) agents capable of improving solver performance in safety-critical environments.</p></details> | <details><summary>25 pa...</summary><p>25 pages, 6 figures, presented at XXII SITRAER 2025, in processes for submission to JATM</p></details> |
| **[Deep FlexQP: Accelerated Nonlinear Programming via Deep Unfolding](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.01565v1)** | 2025-12-01 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose an always-feasible quadratic programming (QP) optimizer, FlexQP, which is based on an exact relaxation of the QP constraints. If the original constraints are feasible, then the optimizer finds the optimal solution to the original QP. On the other hand, if the constraints are infeasible, the optimizer identifies a solution that minimizes the constraint violation in a sparse manner. FlexQP scales favorably with respect to the problem dimension, is robust to both feasible and infeasible QPs with minimal assumptions on the problem data, and can be effectively warm-started. We subsequently apply deep unfolding to improve our optimizer through data-driven techniques, leading to an accelerated Deep FlexQP. By learning dimension-agnostic feedback policies for the parameters from a small number of training examples, Deep FlexQP generalizes to problems with larger dimensions and can optimize for many more iterations than it was initially trained for. Our approach outperforms two recently proposed state-of-the-art accelerated QP approaches on a suite of benchmark systems including portfolio optimization, classification, and regression problems. We provide guarantees on the expected performance of our deep QP optimizer through probably approximately correct (PAC) Bayes generalization bounds. These certificates are used to design an accelerated sequential quadratic programming solver that solves nonlinear optimal control and predictive safety filter problems faster than traditional approaches. Overall, our approach is very robust and greatly outperforms existing non-learning and learning-based optimizers in terms of both runtime and convergence to the optimal solution across multiple classes of NLPs.</p></details> |  |
| **[SizeGS: Size-aware Compression of 3D Gaussian Splatting via Mixed Integer Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2412.05808v2)** | 2025-11-29 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advances in 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) have greatly improved 3D reconstruction. However, its substantial data size poses a significant challenge for transmission and storage. While many compression techniques have been proposed, they fail to efficiently adapt to fluctuating network bandwidth, leading to resource wastage. We address this issue from the perspective of size-aware compression, where we aim to compress 3DGS to a desired size by quickly searching for suitable hyperparameters. Through a measurement study, we identify key hyperparameters that affect the size -- namely, the reserve ratio of Gaussians and bit-width settings for Gaussian attributes. Then, we formulate this hyperparameter optimization problem as a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, with the goal of maximizing visual quality while respecting the size budget constraint. To solve the MINLP, we decouple this problem into two parts: discretely sampling the reserve ratio and determining the bit-width settings using integer linear programming (ILP). To solve the ILP more quickly and accurately, we design a quality loss estimator and a calibrated size estimator, as well as implement a CUDA kernel. Extensive experiments on multiple 3DGS variants demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance in post-training compression. Furthermore, our method can achieve comparable quality to leading training-required methods after fine-tuning.</p></details> | <details><summary>Autom...</summary><p>Automatically compressing 3DGS into the desired file size while maximizing the visual quality</p></details> |

A major challenge in DQC lies in reducing the communication cost introduced by remote CNOT gates, which are significantly slower and more resource-consuming than local operations. Existing DQC approaches treat the three essential components (qubit allocation, entanglement management, and network scheduling) as independent stages, optimizing each in isolation. However, we observe that these components are inherently interdependent, and therefore adopting a unified optimization strategy can be more efficient to achieve the global optimal solutions. Consequently, we propose UNIQ, a novel DQC optimization framework that integrates all three components into a non-linear integer programming (NIP) model. UNIQ aims to reduce the circuit runtime by maximizing parallel Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) pair generation through the use of idle communication qubits, while simultaneously minimizing the communication cost of remote gates. To solve this NP-hard formulated problem, we adopt two key strategies: a greedy algorithm for efficiently mapping logical qubits to different QPUs, and a JIT (Just-In-Time) approach that builds EPR pairs in parallel within each time slot. Extensive simulation results demonstrate that our approach is widely applicable to diverse quantum circuits and QPU topologies, while substantially reducing communication cost and runtime over existing methods.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automated Program Repair of Uncompilable Student Code](https://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06187v2)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A significant portion of student programming submissions in CS1 learning environments are uncompilable, limiting their use in student modeling and downstream knowledge tracing. Traditional modeling pipelines often exclude these cases, discarding observations of student learning. This study investigates automated program repair as a strategy to recover uncompilable code while preserving students' structural intent for use in student modeling. Within this framework, we assess large language models (LLMs) as repair agents under high- and low-context prompting conditions. Repairs were evaluated for compilability, edit distance, and preservation of students' original structure and logic. While all models produced compilable repairs, they differed in how well they preserve students' control flow and code structure, affecting their pedagogical utility. By recovering uncompilable submissions, this work enables richer and more comprehensive analyses of learners' coding processes and development over time.</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings of the 57th ACM Technical Symposium on Computer Science Education V.2 (SIGCSE TS 2026)</p></details> |
| **[Functional Program Synthesis with Higher-Order Functions and Recursion Schemes](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23354v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program synthesis is the process of generating a computer program following a set of specifications, such as a set of input-output examples. It can be modeled as a search problem in which the search space is the set of all valid programs. As the search space is vast, brute force is usually not feasible, and search heuristics, such as genetic programming, also have difficulty navigating it without guidance. This text presents 2 novel GP algorithms that synthesize pure, typed, and functional programs: HOTGP and Origami. HOTGP uses strong types and a functional grammar, synthesizing Haskell code, with support for higher-order functions, $λ$-functions, and parametric polymorphism. Experimental results show that HOTGP is competitive with the state of the art. Additionally, Origami is an algorithm that tackles the challenge of effectively handling loops and recursion by exploring Recursion Schemes, in which the programs are composed of well-defined templates with only a few parts that need to be synthesized. The first implementation of Origami can synthesize solutions in several Recursion Schemes and data structures, being competitive with other GP methods in the literature, as well as LLMs. The latest version of Origami employs a novel procedure, called AC/DC, designed to improve the search-space exploration. It achieves considerable improvement over its previous version by raising success rates on every problem. Compared to similar methods in the literature, it has the highest count of problems solved with success rates of $100\%$, $\geq 75\%$, and $\geq 25\%$ across all benchmarks. In $18\%$ of all benchmark problems, it stands as the only method to reach $100\%$ success rate, being the first known approach to achieve it on any problem in PSB2. It also demonstrates competitive performance to LLMs, achieving the highest overall win-rate against Copilot among all GP methods.</p></details> | Doctoral thesis |
| **[All for One and One for All: Program Logics for Exploiting Internal Determinism in Parallel Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.23283v1)** | 2025-11-28 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Nondeterminism makes parallel programs challenging to write and reason about. To avoid these challenges, researchers have developed techniques for internally deterministic parallel programming, in which the steps of a parallel computation proceed in a deterministic way. Internal determinism is useful because it lets a programmer reason about a program as if it executed in a sequential order. However, no verification framework exists to exploit this property and simplify formal reasoning about internally deterministic programs. To capture the essence of why internally deterministic programs should be easier to reason about, this paper defines a property called schedule-independent safety. A program satisfies schedule-independent safety, if, to show that the program is safe across all orderings, it suffices to show that one terminating execution of the program is safe. We then present a separation logic called Musketeer for proving that a program satisfies schedule-independent safety. Once a parallel program has been shown to satisfy schedule-independent safety, we can verify it with a new logic called Angelic, which allows one to dynamically select and verify just one sequential ordering of the program. Using Musketeer, we prove the soundness of MiniDet, an affine type system for enforcing internal determinism. MiniDet supports several core algorithmic primitives for internally deterministic programming that have been identified in the research literature, including a deterministic version of a concurrent hash set. Because any syntactically well-typed MiniDet program satisfies schedule-independent safety, we can apply Angelic to verify such programs. All results in this paper have been verified in Rocq using the Iris separation logic framework.</p></details> | <details><summary>32 pa...</summary><p>32 pages, 26 figures, extended version of the same paper accepted at POPL 2026</p></details> |

This symbolic search is fundamentally limited by its inability to directly reason about program behavior. We introduce Gradient-Based Program Repair (GBPR), a new paradigm that reframes program repair as continuous optimization in a differentiable numerical program space. Our core insight is to compile symbolic programs into differentiable numerical representations, enabling search in the numerical program space directly guided by program behavior. To evaluate GBPR, we present RaspBugs, a new benchmark of 1,466 buggy symbolic RASP programs and their respective numerical representations. Our experiments demonstrate that GBPR can effectively repair buggy symbolic programs by gradient-based optimization in the numerical program space, with convincing repair trajectories. To our knowledge, we are the first to state program repair as continuous optimization in a numerical program space. Our work establishes a new direction for program repair research, bridging two rich worlds: continuous optimization and program behavior.</p></details> |  |

Bipartite treewidth can be seen as a common generalization of treewidth and the odd cycle transversal number, and is closely related to odd-minors. Intuitively, a bipartite tree decomposition is a tree decomposition whose bags induce almost bipartite graphs and whose adhesions contain at most one "bipartite" vertex, while the width of such decomposition measures the number of "non-bipartite" vertices in a bag. We provide para-NP-completeness results and develop dynamic programming techniques to solve problems on graphs of small btw. In particular, we show that $K_t$-Subgraph-Cover, Weighted Independent Set, Odd Cycle Transversal, and Maximum Weighted Cut are $FPT$ parameterized by btw. We also provide the following dichotomy when $H$ is a 2-connected graph: if $H$ is bipartite, then $H$-Subgraph/Induced-Subgraph/Odd-Minor/Scattered-Packing is para-NP-complete parameterized by btw while, if $H$ is non-bipartite, then the problem is solvable in XP-time.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prese...</summary><p>Presented in IPEC 2023</p></details> |
| **[Denotational semantics for stabiliser quantum programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22734v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The stabiliser fragment of quantum theory is a foundational building block for quantum error correction and the fault-tolerant compilation of quantum programs. In this article, we develop a sound, universal and complete denotational semantics for stabiliser operations which include measurement, classically-controlled Pauli operators, and affine classical operations, in which quantum error-correcting codes are first-class objects. The operations are interpreted as certain affine relations over finite fields. This offers a conceptually motivated and computationally-tractable alternative to the standard operator-algebraic semantics of quantum programs (whose time complexity grows exponentially as the state space increases in size). We demonstrate the power of the resulting semantics by describing a small, proof-of-concept assembly language for stabiliser programs with fully-abstract denotational semantics.</p></details> |  |

Our framework is based on a many-sorted system of hybrid modal logic, for which we prove completeness results. We believe that our approach to program verification improves over the existing approaches within modal logic as (1) it is based on operational semantics which allows for a more natural description of the execution than Hoare's style weakest precondition used by dynamic logic; (2) being multi-sorted, it allows for a clearer encoding of semantics, with a smaller representational distance to its intended meaning.</p></details> |  |

While significant strides have been made in quantum error correction, many challenges persist, particularly in the realm of noise and scalability. Analogue quantum computing schemes, such as Analogue Hamiltonian Simulation and Quantum Annealing, offer a promising approach to address these limitations. By operating at a higher level of abstraction, these schemes can simplify the development of large-scale quantum algorithms. To fully harness the power of quantum computers, they must be seamlessly integrated with traditional high-performance computing (HPC) systems. While substantial research has focused on the integration of circuit-based quantum computers with HPC, the integration of analogue quantum computers remains relatively unexplored. This paper aims to bridge this gap by contributing in the following way: Comprehensive Survey: We conduct a comprehensive survey of existing quantum software tools with analogue capabilities. Readiness Assessment: We introduce a classification and rating system to assess the readiness of these tools for HPC integration. Gap Identification and Recommendations: We identify critical gaps in the landscape of analogue quantum programming models and propose actionable recommendations for future research and development.</p></details> | <details><summary>42 pa...</summary><p>42 pages, 6 figures, submitted and accepted to Quantum Journal.

| **[A programming language combining quantum and classical control](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22537v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The two main notions of control in quantum programming languages are often referred to as "quantum" control and "classical" control. With the latter, the control flow is based on classical information, potentially resulting from a quantum measurement, and this paradigm is well-suited to mixed state quantum computation. Whereas with quantum control, we are primarily focused on pure quantum computation and there the "control" is based on superposition. The two paradigms have not mixed well traditionally and they are almost always treated separately. In this work, we show that the paradigms may be combined within the same system. The key ingredients for achieving this are: (1) syntactically: a modality for incorporating pure quantum types into a mixed state quantum type system; (2) operationally: an adaptation of the notion of "quantum configuration" from quantum lambda-calculi, where the quantum data is replaced with pure quantum primitives; (3) denotationally: suitable (sub)categories of Hilbert spaces, for pure computation and von Neumann algebras, for mixed state computation in the Heisenberg picture of quantum mechanics.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of https://www.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-031-90897-2_8 and related to the PhD thesis at arXiv:2406.07216</p></details> |
| **[Balancing Two-Dimensional Straight-Line Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.22212v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We consider building, given a straight-line program (SLP) consisting of $g$ productions deriving a two-dimensional string $T$ of size $N\times N$, a structure capable of providing random access to any character of $T$. For one-dimensional strings, it is now known how to build a structure of size $\mathcal{O}(g)$ that provides random access in $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ time. In fact, it is known that this can be obtained by building an equivalent SLP of size $\mathcal{O}(g)$ and depth $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ [Ganardi, Jeż, Lohrey, JACM 2021]. We consider the analogous question for two-dimensional strings: can we build an equivalent SLP of roughly the same size and small depth? We show that the answer is negative: there exists an infinite family of two-dimensional strings of size $N\times N$ described by a 2D SLP of size $g$ such that any 2D SLP describing the same string of depth $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ must be of size $Ω(g\cdot N/\log^{3}N)$. We complement this with an upper bound showing how to construct such a 2D SLP of size $\mathcal{O}(g\cdot N)$. Next, we observe that one can naturally define a generalization of 2D SLP, which we call 2D SLP with holes. We show that a known general balancing theorem by [Ganardi, Jeż, Lohrey, JACM 2021] immediately implies that, given a 2D SLP of size $g$ deriving a string of size $N\times N$, we can construct a 2D SLP with holes of depth $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ and size $\mathcal{O}(g)$. This allows us to conclude that there is a structure of size $\mathcal{O}(g)$ providing random access in $\mathcal{O}(\log N)$ time for such a 2D SLP. Further, this can be extended (analogously as for a 1D SLP) to obtain a structure of size $\mathcal{O}(g \log^εN)$ providing random access in $\mathcal{O}(\log N/\log \log N)$ time, for any $ε>0$.</p></details> |  |
| **[Online Inference of Constrained Optimization: Primal-Dual Optimality and Sequential Quadratic Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2512.08948v1)** | 2025-11-27 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study online statistical inference for the solutions of stochastic optimization problems with equality and inequality constraints. Such problems are prevalent in statistics and machine learning, encompassing constrained $M$-estimation, physics-informed models, safe reinforcement learning, and algorithmic fairness. We develop a stochastic sequential quadratic programming (SSQP) method to solve these problems, where the step direction is computed by sequentially performing a quadratic approximation of the objective and a linear approximation of the constraints. Despite having access to unbiased estimates of population gradients, a key challenge in constrained stochastic problems lies in dealing with the bias in the step direction. As such, we apply a momentum-style gradient moving-average technique within SSQP to debias the step. We show that our method achieves global almost-sure convergence and exhibits local asymptotic normality with an optimal primal-dual limiting covariance matrix in the sense of Hájek and Le Cam. In addition, we provide a plug-in covariance matrix estimator for practical inference. To our knowledge, the proposed SSQP method is the first fully online method that attains primal-dual asymptotic minimax optimality without relying on projection operators onto the constraint set, which are generally intractable for nonlinear problems. Through extensive experiments on benchmark nonlinear problems, as well as on constrained generalized linear models and portfolio allocation problems using both synthetic and real data, we demonstrate superior performance of our method, showing that the method and its asymptotic behavior not only solve constrained stochastic problems efficiently but also provide valid and practical online inference in real-world applications.</p></details> | <details><summary>80 pa...</summary><p>80 pages, 5 figures, 5 tables</p></details> |

This dissertation optimizes human-AI programming roles through self-determination theory and personality psychology, introducing the Role Optimization Motivation Alignment (ROMA) framework. Through Design Science Research spanning five cycles, this work establishes empirically-validated connections between personality traits, programming role preferences, and collaborative outcomes, engaging 200 experimental participants and 46 interview respondents. Key findings demonstrate that personality-driven role optimization significantly enhances self-determination and team dynamics, yielding 23% average motivation increases among professionals and up to 65% among undergraduates. Five distinct personality archetypes emerge: The Explorer (high Openness/low Agreeableness), The Orchestrator (high Extraversion/Agreeableness), The Craftsperson (high Neuroticism/low Extraversion), The Architect (high Conscientiousness), and The Adapter (balanced profile). Each exhibits distinct preferences for programming roles (Co-Pilot, Co-Navigator, Agent), with assignment modes proving crucial for satisfaction. The dissertation contributes: (1) an empirically-validated framework linking personality traits to role preferences and self-determination outcomes; (2) a taxonomy of AI collaboration modalities mapped to personality profiles while preserving human agency; and (3) an ISO/IEC 29110 extension enabling Very Small Entities to implement personality-driven role optimization within established standards.

This work introduces MeshCone, a convex optimization framework for guided mesh refinement that leverages reference geometry to correct deformed or degraded meshes. We formulate the problem as a second-order cone program where vertex positions are optimized to align with target geometry while enforcing smoothness through convex edge-length regularization. MeshCone performs geometry-aware optimization that preserves fine details while correcting structural defects. We demonstrate robust performance across 56 diverse object categories from ShapeNet and ThreeDScans, achieving superior refinement quality compared to Laplacian smoothing and unoptimized baselines while maintaining sub-second inference times. MeshCone is particularly suited for applications where reference geometry is available, such as mesh-from-template workflows, scan-to-CAD alignment, and quality assurance in asset production pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[Prune4Web: DOM Tree Pruning Programming for Web Agent](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21398v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Web automation employs intelligent agents to execute high-level tasks by mimicking human interactions with web interfaces. Despite the capabilities of recent Large Language Model (LLM)-based web agents, navigating complex, real-world webpages efficiently remains a significant hurdle due to the prohibitively large size of Document Object Model (DOM) structures, often ranging from 10,000 to 100,000 tokens. Existing strategies typically rely on crude DOM truncation -- risking the loss of critical information -- or employ inefficient heuristics and separate ranking models, failing to achieve an optimal balance between precision and scalability. To address these challenges, we introduce Prune4Web, a novel paradigm that shifts DOM processing from resource-intensive LLM reading to efficient programmatic pruning. Central to our approach is DOM Tree Pruning Programming, where an LLM generates executable Python scoring scripts to dynamically filter DOM elements based on semantic cues from decomposed sub-tasks. This mechanism eliminates the need for LLMs to ingest raw, massive DOMs, instead delegating traversal and scoring to lightweight, interpretable programs. This methodology achieves a 25x to 50x reduction in candidate elements for grounding, thereby facilitating precise action localization while mitigating attention dilution. Furthermore, we propose a specialized data annotation pipeline and a two-turn dialogue training strategy that jointly optimizes the Planner, Programmatic Filter, and Grounder within a unified framework. Extensive experiments demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Notably, on our low-level grounding task, Prune4Web dramatically improves accuracy from 46.8% to 88.28%, underscoring its efficacy in real-world web automation.</p></details> | <details><summary>Paper...</summary><p>Paper accepted to AAAI 2026</p></details> |
| **[Quantum Programming Without the Quantum Physics](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.16234v2)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a quantum programming paradigm where all data are familiar classical data, and the only non-classical element is a random number generator that can return results with negative probability. Currently, the vast majority of quantum programming languages instead work with quantum data types made up of qubits. The description of their behavior relies on heavy linear algebra and many interdependent concepts and intuitions from quantum physics, which takes dedicated study to understand. We demonstrate that the proposed view of quantum programming explains its central concepts and constraints in more accessible, computationally relevant terms. This is achieved by systematically reducing everything to the existence of that negative-probability random generator, avoiding mention of advanced physics as much as possible. This makes quantum programming more accessible to programmers without a deep background in physics or linear algebra. The bulk of this paper is written with such an audience in mind. As a working vehicle, we lay out a simple quantum programming language under this paradigm, showing that not only can it express all quantum programs, it also naturally captures the semantics of measurement without ever mentioning qubits or collapse. The language is proved to be implementable and universal.</p></details> | <details><summary>20 pa...</summary><p>20 pages, 5 figures. Version accepted at APLAS 2024</p></details> |
| **[Convex Mixed-Integer Programming for Causal Additive Models with Optimization and Statistical Guarantees](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21126v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study the problem of learning a directed acyclic graph from data generated according to an additive, non-linear structural equation model with Gaussian noise. We express each non-linear function through a basis expansion, and derive a maximum likelihood estimator with a group l0-regularization that penalizes the number of edges in the graph. The resulting estimator is formulated through a convex mixed-integer program, enabling the use of branch-and-bound methods to obtain a solution that is guaranteed to be accurate up to a pre-specified optimality gap. Our formulation can naturally encode background knowledge, such as the presence or absence of edges and partial order constraints among the variables. We establish consistency guarantees for our estimator in terms of graph recovery, even when the number of variables grows with the sample size. Additionally, by connecting the optimality guarantees with our statistical error bounds, we derive an early stopping criterion that allows terminating the branch-and-bound procedure while preserving consistency. Compared with existing approaches that either assume equal error variances, restrict to linear structural equation models, or rely on heuristic procedures, our method enjoys both optimization and statistical guarantees. Extensive simulations and real-data analysis show that the proposed method achieves markedly better graph recovery performance.</p></details> |  |
| **[BRIDGE: Building Representations In Domain Guided Program Verification](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.21104v1)** | 2025-11-26 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) have achieved impressive results in code generation, yet struggle with program verification, especially in interactive proof frameworks such as Lean4. A central challenge is scalability: verified synthesis requires not just code, but also precise specifications and correctness proofs, and existing approaches rarely span all three domains. We present BRIDGE, the first systematic study of structured prompting for scalable verified program generation. BRIDGE decomposes verification into three interconnected domains: Code (executable implementations), Specifications (formal intent statements), and Proofs (constructive correctness arguments). Our key idea is to elicit distinct reasoning behaviors functional, specification-driven, and proof-oriented as intermediate representations that preserve semantic structure and connect these domains. Through systematic ablations, we show that this approach substantially improves both accuracy and efficiency beyond standard error feedback methods. For example, functional reasoning improves correctness of code in formal languages (Lean4) by nearly 1.5x (pass@5) over direct baselines. In inference-time compute, functional reasoning is also 2x more efficient, achieving higher pass rates with fewer generations and lower total sampling budgets. Similarly, we find that specification-driven prompting boosts Python coding pass rates by up to 17.5%. These findings suggest that structured domain alignment is a promising direction for advancing verified synthesis. BRIDGE establishes a foundation for training via expert iteration or RLVR, enabling models to internalize these reasoning strategies across code, specifications, and proofs.</p></details> | <details><summary>Appro...</summary><p>Approx. 31 pages including appendices, 11 figures, 4 tables.

As part of the study, the existing adaptive program management tools are analyzed, the use of infrastructure systems modelling tools is justified for program architecture and WBS creation. Existing models and modelling methods are viewed, and machine learning and artificial neural networks are selected for the model. The main components of the model are defined, which include a set of decision-maker preferences, decision-making tasks, sets of input data, and applied software components of the model. To support decision-making, the adaptive model applies the method of system modeling and predicting the value of the objective function at a given system configuration. Prediction is done using machine learning methods based on a dataset consisting of historical data related to existing engineering systems. The work describes the components of the redistribution of varied model parameters, which modify the model dataset based on the selected object type, which allows adapting the decision-making process to the existing program implementation goals. The functional composition done in Microsoft Azure Machine Learning Studio is described. The neural network parameters and evaluation results are given. The application of the developed adaptive model is possible in the management of programs for the reconstruction of such engineering systems as systems of heat, gas, electricity supply, water supply, and drainage, etc.</p></details> | <details><summary>8 pag...</summary><p>8 pages, 2 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

By expressing a constrained optimisation as one of simulation from a Boltzmann distribution, we reformulate integer and linear programming as Monte Carlo optimisation problems. The key insight is that solving these optimisation problems requires the ability to simulate from truncated distributions, namely multivariate exponentials and Gaussians. Efficient simulation can be achieved using the algorithms of Kent and Davis. We demonstrate our methodology on portfolio optimisation and the classical farmer problem from stochastic programming.

Inference is challenging, especially when exact rather than approximate results are required. Inspired by recent work on probability generating functions (PGFs), we propose encoding distributions on $\mathbb{N}^k$ as weighted automata over a commutative alphabet with $k$ symbols. Based on this, we map the semantics of various imperative programming statements to automata-theoretic constructions. For a rich class of programs, this results in an effective translation from prior to posterior distribution, both encoded as automata. We prove that our approach is sound with respect to a standard operational program semantics.</p></details> |  |

In the standard quantum circuit model, adding a 1-qubit basis-changing gate -- commonly chosen to be the Hadamard gate -- to a universal set of classical reversible gates yields computationally universal quantum computation. However, the computational behaviours enabled by this addition are not fully characterised. We give such a characterisation by introducing a small quantum programming language extending the universal classical reversible programming language $Π$ with a single primitive corresponding to the Hadamard gate. The language comes equipped with a sound and complete categorical semantics that is specified by a purely equational theory. Completeness is shown by means of a novel finite presentation, and a corresponding synthesis algorithm, for the groups of orthogonal matrices with entries in the ring $\mathbb{Z}[\tfrac{1}{\sqrt{2}}]$.</p></details> | <details><summary>116 p...</summary><p>116 pages; v2: Extended version of POPL 2026 publication</p></details> |
| **[Searching Latent Program Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2411.08706v3)** | 2025-11-25 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>General intelligence requires systems that acquire new skills efficiently and generalize beyond their training distributions. Although program synthesis approaches have strong generalization power, they face scaling issues due to the large combinatorial spaces that quickly render them impractical, requiring human-generated DSLs or pre-trained priors to narrow this search space. On the other hand, deep learning methods have had high successes, but they lack structured test-time adaptation and rely on heavy stochastic sampling or expensive gradient updates for fine-tuning. In this work, we propose the Latent Program Network (LPN), a novel architecture that builds in test-time search directly into neural models. LPN learns a latent space of implicit programs -- neurally mapping inputs to outputs -- through which it can search using gradients at test time. LPN combines the adaptability of symbolic approaches and the scalability of neural methods. It searches through a compact latent space at test time and bypasses the need for pre-defined domain-specific languages. On a range of programming-by-examples tasks, LPN either outperforms or matches performance compared to in-context learning and test-time training methods. Tested on the ARC-AGI benchmark, we demonstrate that LPN can both learn a compact program space and search through it at test time to adapt to novel tasks. LPN doubles its performance on out-of-distribution tasks when test-time search is switched on.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025 spotlight.

As a result, a mutation-alone $(1+λ)$ evolutionary strategy has become the canonical approach for CGP. Although several operators have been developed that demonstrate an increased performance over the canonical method, a general solution to the problem is still lacking. In this paper, we compare basic crossover methods, namely one-point and uniform, to variants in which nodes are ``preserved,'' including the subgraph crossover developed by Roman Kalkreuth, the difference being that when ``node preservation'' is active, crossover is not allowed to break apart instructions. We also compare a node mutation operator to the traditional point mutation; the former simply replaces an entire node with a new one. We find that node preservation in both mutation and crossover improves search using symbolic regression benchmark problems, moving the field towards a general solution to CGP crossover.</p></details> | <details><summary>Draft...</summary><p>Draft to cite in another paper before both papers are peer-reviewed for the evo*2026 conference, 21 pages, 5 figures</p></details> |

Strong equivalence of two programs can be sometimes established by deriving rules of each program from rules of the other in an appropriate deductive system. This paper shows how to extend this method of proving strong equivalence to programs containing the counting aggregate.</p></details> | <details><summary>Under...</summary><p>Under consideration in Theory and Practice of Logic Programming (TPLP)</p></details> |
| **[Can LLMs Recover Program Semantics? A Systematic Evaluation with Symbolic Execution](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.19130v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Obfuscation poses a persistent challenge for software engineering tasks such as program comprehension, maintenance, testing, and vulnerability detection. While compiler optimizations and third-party code often introduce transformations that obscure program intent, existing analysis tools and large language models (LLMs) struggle to recover the original semantics. In this work, we investigate whether LLMs, when fine-tuned with symbolic execution artifacts, can effectively deobfuscate programs and restore analyzability. We construct a benchmark by applying four widely studied transformations-control-flow flattening, opaque predicates, arithmetic encoding, and branch encoding-across diverse C programs from TUM Obfuscation Benchmarks, the LLVM test suite, and algorithmic repositories. We then compare three state-of-the-art LLMs under two training configurations: baseline fine-tuning on obfuscated/original code pairs, and enhanced fine-tuning with additional KLEE artifacts such as SMT constraints, path statistics, and test cases. Our evaluation examines syntactic correctness (compilation success), semantic fidelity (behavioral equivalence under symbolic execution), and code quality (readability and structure). Results show that GPT-4.1-mini achieves the strongest deobfuscation overall, and that incorporating KLEE artifacts consistently improves semantic preservation and compilation success across models. These findings highlight deobfuscation as a broader software engineering concern, demonstrating that combining LLMs with symbolic execution can strengthen automated testing, static analysis, and program comprehension in the presence of obfuscation.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM Chatbots in High School Programming: Exploring Behaviors and Interventions](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18985v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This study uses a Design-Based Research (DBR) cycle to refine the integration of Large Language Models (LLMs) in high school programming education. The initial problem was identified in an Intervention Group where, in an unguided setting, a higher proportion of executive, solution-seeking queries correlated strongly and negatively with exam performance. A contemporaneous Comparison Group demonstrated that without guidance, these unproductive help-seeking patterns do not self-correct, with engagement fluctuating and eventually declining. This insight prompted a mid-course pedagogical intervention in the first group, designed to teach instrumental help-seeking. The subsequent evaluation confirmed the intervention's success, revealing a decrease in executive queries, as well as a shift toward more productive learning workflows. However, this behavioral change did not translate into a statistically significant improvement in exam grades, suggesting that altering tool-use strategies alone may be insufficient to overcome foundational knowledge gaps. The DBR process thus yields a more nuanced principle: the educational value of an LLM depends on a pedagogy that scaffolds help-seeking, but this is only one part of the complex process of learning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Synthesizing Visual Concepts as Vision-Language Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18964v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Vision-Language models (VLMs) achieve strong performance on multimodal tasks but often fail at systematic visual reasoning tasks, leading to inconsistent or illogical outputs. Neuro-symbolic methods promise to address this by inducing interpretable logical rules, though they exploit rigid, domain-specific perception modules. We propose Vision-Language Programs (VLP), which combine the perceptual flexibility of VLMs with systematic reasoning of program synthesis. Rather than embedding reasoning inside the VLM, VLP leverages the model to produce structured visual descriptions that are compiled into neuro-symbolic programs. The resulting programs execute directly on images, remain consistent with task constraints, and provide human-interpretable explanations that enable easy shortcut mitigation. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that VLPs outperform direct and structured prompting, particularly on tasks requiring complex logical reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pre-Filtering Code Suggestions using Developer Behavioral Telemetry to Optimize LLM-Assisted Programming](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18849v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly integrated into code editors to provide AI-powered code suggestions. Yet many of these suggestions are ignored, resulting in wasted computation, increased latency, and unnecessary interruptions. We introduce a lightweight pre-filtering model that predicts the likelihood of suggestion acceptance before invoking the LLM, using only real-time developer telemetry such as typing speed, file navigation, and editing activity. Deployed in a production-grade Visual Studio Code plugin over four months of naturalistic use, our approach nearly doubled acceptance rates (18.4% -> 34.2%) while suppressing 35% of low-value LLM calls. These findings demonstrate that behavioral signals alone can meaningfully improve both user experience and system efficiency in LLM-assisted programming, highlighting the value of timing-aware, privacy-preserving adaptation mechanisms. The filter operates solely on pre-invocation editor telemetry and never inspects code or prompts.</p></details> | <details><summary>\c{op...</summary><p>\c{opyright} 2025 IEEE.

| **[Summary-Mediated Repair: Can LLMs use code summarisation as a tool for program repair?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18782v1)** | 2025-11-24 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) often produce code with subtle implementation-level bugs despite strong benchmark performance. These errors are hard for LLMs to spot and can have large behavioural effects; yet when asked to summarise code, LLMs can frequently surface high-level intent and sometimes overlook this low-level noise. Motivated by this, we propose summary-mediated repair, a prompt-only pipeline for program repair that leverages natural-language code summarisation as an explicit intermediate step, extending previous work that has already shown code summarisation to be a useful intermediary for downstream tasks. We evaluate our method across eight production-grade LLMs on two function level benchmarks (HumanEvalPack and MBPP), comparing several summary styles against a direct repair baseline. Error-aware diagnostic summaries consistently yield the largest gains - repairing up to 65% of unseen errors, on average of 5% more than the baseline - though overall improvements are modest and LLM-dependent. Our results position summaries as a cheap, human-interpretable diagnostic artefact that can be integrated into program-repair pipelines rather than a stand-alone fix-all.</p></details> | <details><summary>6 pag...</summary><p>6 pages, 3 tables, 1 figure</p></details> |
| **[Toward Trustworthy Difficulty Assessments: Large Language Models as Judges in Programming and Synthetic Tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18597v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive capabilities in natural language and code generation, and are increasingly deployed as automatic judges of model outputs and learning activities. Yet, their behavior on structured tasks such as predicting the difficulty of competitive programming problems remains under-explored. We conduct a systematic comparison of GPT-4o, used purely as a natural-language difficulty assessor, against an interpretable Light-GBM ensemble trained on explicit numeric and textual features. On a dataset of 1,825 LeetCode problems labeled Easy, Medium, or Hard, LightGBM attains 86% accuracy, whereas GPT-4o reaches only 37.75%. Detailed analyses, including confusion matrices and SHAP-based interpretability, show that numeric constraints -- such as input size limits and acceptance rates -- play a crucial role in separating Hard problems from easier ones. By contrast, GPT-4o often overlooks these cues and exhibits a strong bias toward simpler categories. We further probe GPT-4o through a synthetic Hard-problem generation protocol. Surprisingly, GPT-4o labels almost all of its own synthetic Hard problems as Medium, contradicting its tendency to downgrade real Hard problems to Easy. Our findings connect to recent work on LLMs-as-judges and automatic difficulty estimation in programming and education, and highlight concrete failure modes that must be addressed before LLM-based judges can be considered trustworthy in competitive programming, educational platforms, or reinforcement-learning pipelines.</p></details> |  |
| **[HQPEF-Py: Metrics, Python Patterns, and Guidance for Evaluating Hybrid Quantum Programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18506v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We study how to evaluate hybrid quantum programs as end-to-end workflows rather than as isolated devices or algorithms. Building on the Hybrid Quantum Program Evaluation Framework (HQPEF), we formalize a workflow-aware Quantum Readiness Level (QRL) score; define a normalized speedup under quality constraints for the Utility of Quantumness (UQ); and provide a timing-and-drift audit for hybrid pipelines. We complement these definitions with concise Python reference implementations that illustrate how to instantiate the metrics and audit procedures with state-of-the-art classical and quantum solvers (e.g., via Qiskit or PennyLane), while preserving matched-budget discipline and reproducibility.</p></details> | 17 pages |
| **[Graph burning: an overview of mathematical programs](https://arxiv.org/abs/2511.18292v1)** | 2025-11-23 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The Graph Burning Problem (GBP) is a combinatorial optimization problem that has gained relevance as a tool for quantifying a graph's vulnerability to contagion. Although it is based on a very simple propagation model, its decision version is NP-complete, and its optimization version is NP-hard. Many of its theoretical properties across different graph families have been thoroughly explored, and numerous interesting variants have been proposed. This paper reports novel mathematical programs for the optimization version of the classical GBP. Among the presented programs are a Mixed-Integer Linear Program (MILP), a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP), two Integer Linear Programs (ILP), and two Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problems. Most optimization solvers can handle these, being QUBO problems of a capital interest in quantum computing. The primary aim of this paper is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the GBP by examining its different formulations. Compared to other mathematical programs from the literature, the ones presented here are conceptually simpler and involve fewer variables. These make them more practical for finding optimal solutions using optimization algorithms and solvers, as we show by solving some instances with millions of vertices in just a few minutes.</p></details> | 18 pages, 9 figures |
