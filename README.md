| **[TokDrift: When LLM Speaks in Subwords but Code Speaks in Grammar](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14972v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language models (LLMs) for code rely on subword tokenizers, such as byte-pair encoding (BPE), learned from mixed natural language text and programming language code but driven by statistics rather than grammar. As a result, semantically identical code snippets can be tokenized differently depending on superficial factors such as whitespace or identifier naming. To measure the impact of this misalignment, we introduce TokDrift, a framework that applies semantic-preserving rewrite rules to create code variants differing only in tokenization. Across nine code LLMs, including large ones with over 30B parameters, even minor formatting changes can cause substantial shifts in model behavior. Layer-wise analysis shows that the issue originates in early embeddings, where subword segmentation fails to capture grammar token boundaries. Our findings identify misaligned tokenization as a hidden obstacle to reliable code understanding and generation, highlighting the need for grammar-aware tokenization for future code LLMs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Rate-Adaptive Protograph-Based MacKay-Neal Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14856v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Rate-adaptive MacKay-Neal (MN) codes based on protographs are analyzed. The code construction employs an outer distribution matcher (DM) to adapt the rate of the scheme. The DM is coupled with an inner protograph-based low-density parity-check (LDPC) code. The performance achievable by the resulting code structure, that is nonlinear, is studied by means of an equivalent communication model that reduces the problem to the analysis of the inner (linear) LDPC code with transmission that takes place in parallel over the communication channel, and over a suitably defined binary symmetric channel. A density evolution analysis of protograph MN code ensembles is outlined, and it is complemented by an error floor analysis that relies on the derivation of the average input-output weight distribution of the inner LDPC code ensemble. Conditions on the shape of the normalized logarithmic asymptotic input-output weight distribution are defined, which allow discarding code ensembles with bad error floor properties during the code design phase. Examples of code designs are provided, showing how the use of a single LDPC code ensemble allows operating within 1 dB from the Shannon limit over a wide range of code rates, where the code rate is selected by tuning the DM parameters. By enabling rate flexibility with a constant blocklength, and with a fixed LDPC code as inner code, the construction provides an appealing solution for very high-throughput wireless (optical) links that employ binary-input modulations.</p></details> | <details><summary>Publi...</summary><p>Published on IEEE Transactions on Information Theory</p></details> |

By resorting to a suitably-defined parallel channel model, we compute belief propagation decoding thresholds, showing that SC MN code ensembles can perform within 0.15 dB from the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise capacity over the full [0,1] rate range.</p></details> | <details><summary>5 pag...</summary><p>5 pages, 6 figures.

| **[Hierarchical filtrations of line bundles and optimal algebraic geometry codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.01859v4)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce \emph{hierarchical depth}, a new invariant of line bundles and divisors, defined via maximal chains of effective sub-line bundles. This notion gives rise to \emph{hierarchical filtrations}, refining the structure of the Picard group and providing new insights into the geometry of algebraic surfaces. We establish fundamental properties of hierarchical depth, derive inequalities through intersection theory and the Hodge index theorem, and characterize filtrations that are Hodge-tight. Using this framework, we develop a theory of \emph{hierarchical algebraic geometry codes}, constructed from evaluation spaces along these filtrations. This approach produces nested families of codes with controlled growth of parameters and identifies an optimal intermediate code maximizing a utility function balancing rate and minimum distance. Hierarchical depth thus provides a systematic method to construct AG codes with favorable asymptotic behavior, linking geometric and coding-theoretic perspectives. Our results establish new connections between line bundle theory, surface geometry, and coding theory, and suggest applications to generalized Goppa codes and higher-dimensional evaluation codes.</p></details> | Comments are welcome |
| **[Leveraging Code Cohesion Analysis to Identify Source Code Supply Chain Attacks](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14778v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Supply chain attacks significantly threaten software security with malicious code injections within legitimate projects. Such attacks are very rare but may have a devastating impact. Detecting spurious code injections using automated tools is further complicated as it often requires deciphering the intention of both the inserted code and its context. In this study, we propose an unsupervised approach for highlighting spurious code injections by quantifying cohesion disruptions in the source code. Using a name-prediction-based cohesion (NPC) metric, we analyze how function cohesion changes when malicious code is introduced compared to natural cohesion fluctuations. An analysis of 54,707 functions over 369 open-source C++ repositories reveals that code injection reduces cohesion and shifts naming patterns toward shorter, less descriptive names compared to genuine function updates. Considering the sporadic nature of real supply-chain attacks, we evaluate the proposed method with extreme test-set imbalance and show that monitoring high-cohesion functions with NPC can effectively detect functions with injected code, achieving a Precision@100 of 36.41% at a 1:1,000 ratio and 12.47% at 1:10,000. These results suggest that automated cohesion measurements, in general, and name-prediction-based cohesion, in particular, may help identify supply chain attacks, improving source code integrity.</p></details> |  |
| **[Pluto: A Benchmark for Evaluating Efficiency of LLM-generated Hardware Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14756v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly used to automate hardware design tasks, including the generation of Verilog code. While early benchmarks focus primarily on functional correctness, efficient hardware design demands additional optimization for synthesis metrics such as area, delay, and power. Existing benchmarks fall short in evaluating these aspects comprehensively: they often lack optimized baselines or testbenches for verification. To address these gaps, we present Pluto, a benchmark and evaluation framework designed to assess the efficiency of LLM-generated Verilog designs. Pluto presents a comprehensive evaluation set of 114 problems with self-checking testbenches and multiple Pareto-optimal reference implementations. Experimental results show that state-of-the-art LLMs can achieve high functional correctness, reaching 78.3\% at pass@1, but their synthesis efficiency still lags behind expert-crafted implementations, with area efficiency of 63.8\%, delay efficiency of 65.9\%, and power efficiency of 64.0\% at eff@1. This highlights the need for efficiency-aware evaluation frameworks such as Pluto to drive progress in hardware-focused LLM research.</p></details> |  |
| **[Beyond Monolingual Assumptions: A Survey of Code-Switched NLP in the Era of Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.07037v3)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code-switching (CSW), the alternation of languages and scripts within a single utterance, remains a fundamental challenge for multilingual NLP, even amidst the rapid advances of large language models (LLMs). Most LLMs still struggle with mixed-language inputs, limited CSW datasets, and evaluation biases, hindering deployment in multilingual societies. This survey provides the first comprehensive analysis of CSW-aware LLM research, reviewing 308 studies spanning five research areas, 12 NLP tasks, 30+ datasets, and 80+ languages. We classify recent advances by architecture, training strategy, and evaluation methodology, outlining how LLMs have reshaped CSW modeling and what challenges persist. The paper concludes with a roadmap emphasizing the need for inclusive datasets, fair evaluation, and linguistically grounded models to achieve truly multilingual intelligence.

| **[Coder as Editor: Code-driven Interpretable Molecular Optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14455v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Molecular optimization is a central task in drug discovery that requires precise structural reasoning and domain knowledge. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise in generating high-level editing intentions in natural language, they often struggle to faithfully execute these modifications-particularly when operating on non-intuitive representations like SMILES. We introduce MECo, a framework that bridges reasoning and execution by translating editing actions into executable code. MECo reformulates molecular optimization for LLMs as a cascaded framework: generating human-interpretable editing intentions from a molecule and property goal, followed by translating those intentions into executable structural edits via code generation. Our approach achieves over 98% accuracy in reproducing held-out realistic edits derived from chemical reactions and target-specific compound pairs. On downstream optimization benchmarks spanning physicochemical properties and target activities, MECo substantially improves consistency by 38-86 percentage points to 90%+ and achieves higher success rates over SMILES-based baselines while preserving structural similarity. By aligning intention with execution, MECo enables consistent, controllable and interpretable molecular design, laying the foundation for high-fidelity feedback loops and collaborative human-AI workflows in drug discovery.</p></details> |  |
| **[Real-Time Neural Video Compression with Unified Intra and Inter Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14431v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural video compression (NVC) technologies have advanced rapidly in recent years, yielding state-of-the-art schemes such as DCVC-RT that offer superior compression efficiency to H.266/VVC and real-time encoding/decoding capabilities. Nonetheless, existing NVC schemes have several limitations, including inefficiency in dealing with disocclusion and new content, interframe error propagation and accumulation, among others. To eliminate these limitations, we borrow the idea from classic video coding schemes, which allow intra coding within inter-coded frames. With the intra coding tool enabled, disocclusion and new content are properly handled, and interframe error propagation is naturally intercepted without the need for manual refresh mechanisms. We present an NVC framework with unified intra and inter coding, where every frame is processed by a single model that is trained to perform intra/inter coding adaptively. Moreover, we propose a simultaneous two-frame compression design to exploit interframe redundancy not only forwardly but also backwardly. Experimental results show that our scheme outperforms DCVC-RT by an average of 10.7\% BD-rate reduction, delivers more stable bitrate and quality per frame, and retains real-time encoding/decoding performances. Code and models will be released.</p></details> | 10 pages |
| **[The asymptotic number of equivalence classes of linear codes with given dimension](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14424v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We investigate the asymptotic number of equivalence classes of linear codes with prescribed length and dimension. While the total number of inequivalent codes of a given length has been studied previously, the case where the dimension varies as a function of the length has not yet been considered. We derive explicit asymptotic formulas for the number of equivalence classes under three standard notions of equivalence, for a fixed alphabet size and increasing length. Our approach also yields an exact asymptotic expression for the sum of all q-binomial coefficients, which is of independent interest and answers an open question in this context. Finally, we establish a natural connection between these asymptotic quantities and certain discrete Gaussian distributions arising from Brownian motion, providing a probabilistic interpretation of our results.</p></details> |  |
| **[Decoding Balanced Linear Codes With Preprocessing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14347v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prange's information set algorithm is a decoding algorithm for arbitrary linear codes. It decodes corrupted codewords of any $\mathbb{F}_2$-linear code $C$ of message length $n$ up to relative error rate $O(\log n / n)$ in $\mathsf{poly}(n)$ time. We show that the error rate can be improved to $O((\log n)^2 / n)$, provided: (1) the decoder has access to a polynomial-length advice string that depends on $C$ only, and (2) $C$ is $n^{-\Omega(1)}$-balanced. As a consequence we improve the error tolerance in decoding random linear codes if inefficient preprocessing of the code is allowed. This reveals potential vulnerabilities in cryptographic applications of Learning Noisy Parities with low noise rate. Our main technical result is that the Hamming weight of $Hw$, where $H$ is a random sample of *short dual* codewords, measures the proximity of a word $w$ to the code in the regime of interest. Given such $H$ as advice, our algorithm corrects errors by locally minimizing this measure. We show that for most codes, the error rate tolerated by our decoder is asymptotically optimal among all algorithms whose decision is based on thresholding $Hw$ for an arbitrary polynomial-size advice matrix $H$.</p></details> |  |
| **[CodeEvolve: An open source evolutionary coding agent for algorithm discovery and optimization](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14150v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we introduce CodeEvolve, an open-source evolutionary coding agent that unites Large Language Models (LLMs) with genetic algorithms to solve complex computational problems. Our framework adapts powerful evolutionary concepts to the LLM domain, building upon recent methods for generalized scientific discovery. CodeEvolve employs an island-based genetic algorithm to maintain population diversity and increase throughput, introduces a novel inspiration-based crossover mechanism that leverages the LLMs context window to combine features from successful solutions, and implements meta-prompting strategies for dynamic exploration of the solution space. We conduct a rigorous evaluation of CodeEvolve on a subset of the mathematical benchmarks used to evaluate Google DeepMind's closed-source AlphaEvolve. Our findings show that our method surpasses AlphaEvolve's performance on several challenging problems. To foster collaboration and accelerate progress, we release our complete framework as an open-source repository.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 9 figures, 2 tables</p></details> |
| **[David vs. Goliath: A comparative study of different-sized LLMs for code generation in the domain of automotive scenario generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14115v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Scenario simulation is central to testing autonomous driving systems. Scenic, a domain-specific language (DSL) for CARLA, enables precise and reproducible scenarios, but NL-to-Scenic generation with large language models (LLMs) suffers from scarce data, limited reproducibility, and inconsistent metrics. We introduce NL2Scenic, an open dataset and framework with 146 NL/Scenic pairs, a difficulty-stratified 30-case test split, an Example Retriever, and 14 prompting variants (ZS, FS, CoT, SP, MoT). We evaluate 13 models: four proprietary (GPT-4o, GPT-5, Claude-Sonnet-4, Gemini-2.5-pro) and nine open-source code models (Qwen2.5Coder 0.5B-32B; CodeLlama 7B/13B/34B), using text metrics (BLEU, ChrF, EDIT-SIM, CrystalBLEU) and execution metrics (compilation and generation), and compare them with an expert study (n=11). EDIT-SIM correlates best with human judgments; we also propose EDIT-COMP (F1 of EDIT-SIM and compilation) as a robust dataset-level proxy that improves ranking fidelity. GPT-4o performs best overall, while Qwen2.5Coder-14B reaches about 88 percent of its expert score on local hardware. Retrieval-augmented prompting, Few-Shot with Example Retriever (FSER), consistently boosts smaller models, and scaling shows diminishing returns beyond mid-size, with Qwen2.5Coder outperforming CodeLlama at comparable scales. NL2Scenic and EDIT-COMP offer a standardized, reproducible basis for evaluating Scenic code generation and indicate that mid-size open-source models are practical, cost-effective options for autonomous-driving scenario programming.</p></details> |  |
| **[Signature in Code Backdoor Detection, how far are we?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13992v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As Large Language Models (LLMs) become increasingly integrated into software development workflows, they also become prime targets for adversarial attacks. Among these, backdoor attacks are a significant threat, allowing attackers to manipulate model outputs through hidden triggers embedded in training data. Detecting such backdoors remains a challenge, and one promising approach is the use of Spectral Signature defense methods that identify poisoned data by analyzing feature representations through eigenvectors. While some prior works have explored Spectral Signatures for backdoor detection in neural networks, recent studies suggest that these methods may not be optimally effective for code models. In this paper, we revisit the applicability of Spectral Signature-based defenses in the context of backdoor attacks on code models. We systematically evaluate their effectiveness under various attack scenarios and defense configurations, analyzing their strengths and limitations. We found that the widely used setting of Spectral Signature in code backdoor detection is often suboptimal. Hence, we explored the impact of different settings of the key factors. We discovered a new proxy metric that can more accurately estimate the actual performance of Spectral Signature without model retraining after the defense.</p></details> | 20 pages, 3 figures |
| **[RECODE: Reasoning Through Code Generation for Visual Question Answering](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13756v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) struggle with precise reasoning for structured visuals like charts and diagrams, as pixel-based perception lacks a mechanism for verification. To address this, we propose to leverage derendering -- the process of reverse-engineering visuals into executable code -- as a new modality for verifiable visual reasoning. Specifically, we propose RECODE, an agentic framework that first generates multiple candidate programs to reproduce the input image. It then uses a critic to select the most faithful reconstruction and iteratively refines the code. This process not only transforms an ambiguous perceptual task into a verifiable, symbolic problem, but also enables precise calculations and logical inferences later on. On various visual reasoning benchmarks such as CharXiv, ChartQA, and Geometry3K, RECODE significantly outperforms methods that do not leverage code or only use code for drawing auxiliary lines or cropping. Our work demonstrates that grounding visual perception in executable code provides a new path toward more accurate and verifiable multimodal reasoning.</p></details> |  |
| **[On Pretraining for Project-Level Code Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13697v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repository-level pretraining is commonly used to enable large language models for code to leverage codebase-wide context. This enhances their ability to generate accurate and context-aware code completions. In this work, we investigate how different repository-processing strategies affect in-context learning in OpenCoder, a 1.5B-parameter model. We extend its context window from 4,096 to 16,384 tokens by training on additional 1B tokens of curated repository-level data. Despite relying on a smaller dataset than competing models (which often use hundreds of billions of tokens), our model achieves comparable performance on the Long Code Arena benchmark. We find that various repository-processing techniques yield similarly strong results, with the primary gain coming from adapting to a new rotary positional embedding (RoPE) scaling parameter. Finally, we show that a simpler file-level training approach at the original sequence length remains highly effective, opening up repository-level code completion research to settings with more constrained data and compute resources.</p></details> |  |
| **[Unlocking Public Catalogues: Instruction-Tuning LLMs for ICD Coding of German Tumor Diagnoses](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13624v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Accurate coding of tumor diagnoses with ICD-10-GM and ICD-O-3 is essential for structured cancer documentation in Germany. Smaller open-weight LLMs are appealing for privacy-preserving automation but often struggle with coding accuracy in German-language contexts. This study investigates whether instruction-based fine-tuning on public datasets improves the coding accuracy of open-weight LLMs for German tumor diagnosis texts. The evaluation uses coded diagnoses from the local tumor documentation system as test data. In a systematic data quality assessment, the upper limit for ICD-10 coding performance was estimated at 60-79% for exact and 81-94% for partial (three-character codes only) derivation. As training data, over 500,000 question-answer pairs were created based on the ICD-10-GM, ICD-O-3, and OPS catalogues. Eight open-weight models from the Qwen, Llama, and Mistral families (7-70 B parameters) were fine-tuned. ICD-10-GM accuracy rose from 1.4-24% to 41-58%, and partial accuracy from 31-74% to 73-83%. The accuracy of ICD-O-3 topography coding also improved but started and remained considerably lower with an exact accuracy of 22-40% and a partial accuracy of 56-67% after fine-tuning. Malformed code outputs dropped to 0% for all models. Tumor-diagnosis recognition reached 99%. Accuracy correlated positively with model size, but gaps between small and large models narrowed after fine-tuning. The reasoning mode in Qwen3 generally yielded a lower performance than fine-tuning and was over 100 times slower. Our findings highlight the potential of leveraging public catalogues to build instruction datasets that improve LLMs in medical documentation tasks. The complete training dataset and the best-performing checkpoints of the fine-tuned models are available from https://huggingface.co/datasets/stefan-m-lenz/ICDOPS-QA-2024.</p></details> | 19 pages, 4 figures |
| **[Translating Regulatory Clauses into Executable Codes for Building Design Checking via Large Language Model Driven Function Matching and Composing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2308.08728v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Translating clauses into executable code is a vital stage of automated rule checking (ARC) and is essential for effective building design compliance checking, particularly for rules with implicit properties or complex logic requiring domain knowledge. Thus, by systematically analyzing building clauses, 66 atomic functions are defined first to encapsulate common computational logics. Then, LLM-FuncMapper is proposed, a large language model (LLM)-based approach with rule-based adaptive prompts that match clauses to atomic functions. Finally, executable code is generated by composing functions through the LLMs. Experiments show LLM-FuncMapper outperforms fine-tuning methods by 19% in function matching while significantly reducing manual annotation efforts. Case study demonstrates that LLM-FuncMapper can automatically compose multiple atomic functions to generate executable code, boosting rule-checking efficiency. To our knowledge, this research represents the first application of LLMs for interpreting complex design clauses into executable code, which may shed light on further adoption of LLMs in the construction domain.</p></details> |  |
| **[(R)evolution of Programming: Vibe Coding as a Post-Coding Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12364v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Recent advancements in generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), particularly large language models, have introduced new possibilities for software development practices. In our paper we investigate the emerging Vibe Coding (VC) paradigm that emphasizes intuitive, affect-driven, and improvisational interactions between developers and AI systems. Building upon the discourse of End-User Development (EUD), we explore how VC diverges from conventional programming approaches such as those supported by tools like GitHub Copilot. Through five semi-structured interview sessions with ten experienced software practitioners, we identify five thematic dimensions: creativity, sustainability, the future of programming, collaboration, and criticism. Our analysis conceptualizes VC within the metaphor of co-drifting, contrasting it with the prevalent co-piloting perspective of AI-assisted development. We argue that VC reconfigures the developers role, blurring boundaries between professional and non-developers. While VC enables novel forms of expression and rapid prototyping, it also introduces challenges regarding reproducibility, scalability, and inclusivity. We propose that VC represents a meaningful shift in programming culture, warranting further investigation within human-computer interaction (HCI) and software engineering research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop Contribution at the sixth decennial Aarhus conference in "The End of Programming (as we know it) - Envisioning Radical Re-Conceptualizations of Co-Coding with AI"</p></details> |

Automated repair of such failures is promising, but existing techniques rely on test cases, which are not available for non-compilable code. We employ an automated repair approach for compilation errors driven by large language models (LLMs). Our study encompasses the collection of more than 40000 commits from the product's source code. We assess the performance of an industrial CI system enhanced by four state-of-the-art LLMs, comparing their outcomes with manual corrections provided by human programmers. LLM-equipped CI systems can resolve up to 63 % of the compilation errors in our baseline dataset. Among the fixes associated with successful CI builds, 83 % are deemed reasonable. Moreover, LLMs significantly reduce debugging time, with the majority of successful cases completed within 8 minutes, compared to hours typically required for manual debugging.</p></details> | <details><summary>9 pag...</summary><p>9 pages, 4 figures, conference: 2025 28th Euromicro Conference on Digital System Design (DSD)</p></details> |
| **[Non-Linear Precoding via Dirty Paper Coding for Near-Field Downlink MISO Communications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13485v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In 6G systems, extremely large-scale antenna arrays operating at terahertz frequencies extend the near-field region to typical user distances from the base station, enabling near-field communication (NFC) with fine spatial resolution through beamfocusing. Existing multiuser NFC systems predominantly employ linear precoding techniques such as zero-forcing (ZF), which suffer from performance degradation due to the high transmit power required to suppress interference. This paper proposes a nonlinear precoding framework based on Dirty Paper Coding (DPC), which pre-cancels known interference to maximize the sum-rate performance. We formulate and solve the corresponding sum-rate maximization problems, deriving optimal power allocation strategies for both DPC and ZF schemes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that DPC achieves substantial sum-rate gains over ZF across various near-field configurations, with the most pronounced improvements observed for closely spaced users.</p></details> |  |
| **[LTR-ICD: A Learning-to-Rank Approach for Automatic ICD Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13922v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Clinical notes contain unstructured text provided by clinicians during patient encounters. These notes are usually accompanied by a sequence of diagnostic codes following the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). Correctly assigning and ordering ICD codes are essential for medical diagnosis and reimbursement. However, automating this task remains challenging. State-of-the-art methods treated this problem as a classification task, leading to ignoring the order of ICD codes that is essential for different purposes. In this work, as a first attempt, we approach this task from a retrieval system perspective to consider the order of codes, thus formulating this problem as a classification and ranking task. Our results and analysis show that the proposed framework has a superior ability to identify high-priority codes compared to other methods. For instance, our model accuracy in correctly ranking primary diagnosis codes is 47%, compared to 20% for the state-of-the-art classifier. Additionally, in terms of classification metrics, the proposed model achieves a micro- and macro-F1 scores of 0.6065 and 0.2904, respectively, surpassing the previous best model with scores of 0.597 and 0.2660.</p></details> |  |

However, these models often replicate accessibility flaws from their training data, resulting in interfaces that exclude users with diverse needs and contexts. To address this gap, we introduce A11yn, the first method that aligns code-generating LLMs to reliably produce accessibility-compliant web UIs. A11yn optimizes a novel reward function that penalizes violations of the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG), with penalties scaled to the severity of each violation as identified by an accessibility testing engine. To support training, we construct UIReq-6.8K, a dataset of 6,800 diverse instructions for web UI generation. For evaluation, we introduce RealUIReq-300, a benchmark of 300 real-world web UI requests grounded and manually curated from public web pages, spanning a broad range of use cases. Empirical results show that A11yn significantly outperforms strong baselines, lowering the Inaccessibility Rate by 60% over the base model while preserving semantic fidelity and visual quality of generated UIs. These findings demonstrate that accessibility can be systematically optimized within LLMs, showing the feasibility of aligning code generation for accessibility.</p></details> |  |
| **[Latent-Domain Predictive Neural Speech Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2207.08363v3)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Neural audio/speech coding has recently demonstrated its capability to deliver high quality at much lower bitrates than traditional methods. However, existing neural audio/speech codecs employ either acoustic features or learned blind features with a convolutional neural network for encoding, by which there are still temporal redundancies within encoded features. This paper introduces latent-domain predictive coding into the VQ-VAE framework to fully remove such redundancies and proposes the TF-Codec for low-latency neural speech coding in an end-to-end manner. Specifically, the extracted features are encoded conditioned on a prediction from past quantized latent frames so that temporal correlations are further removed. Moreover, we introduce a learnable compression on the time-frequency input to adaptively adjust the attention paid to main frequencies and details at different bitrates. A differentiable vector quantization scheme based on distance-to-soft mapping and Gumbel-Softmax is proposed to better model the latent distributions with rate constraint. Subjective results on multilingual speech datasets show that, with low latency, the proposed TF-Codec at 1 kbps achieves significantly better quality than Opus at 9 kbps, and TF-Codec at 3 kbps outperforms both EVS at 9.6 kbps and Opus at 12 kbps. Numerous studies are conducted to demonstrate the effectiveness of these techniques.

| **[A Matter of Representation: Towards Graph-Based Abstract Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13163v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Most large language models (LLMs) today excel at generating raw, sequential code with minimal abstractions and custom structures. However, there has been little work on graph-based abstract code generation, where significant logic is encapsulated in predefined nodes and execution flow is determined by edges. This is relevant for visual programming languages, and in cases where raw source code is inaccessible to users and LLM training sets. In this work, we propose and evaluate JSON representations for graphs to enable high accuracy graph-based abstract code generation. We evaluate these representations on ScratchTest, a mini-benchmark based on our custom Python re-implementation of Scratch, which tests the LLM in code graph space. Our findings demonstrate that LLMs can indeed perform the aforementioned generation task in a single pass without relying on specialized or complex pipelines, given the correct graph representations. We also show that different representations induce significantly different accuracies, highlighting the instrumental role of representations in this generation task. All in all, this work establishes the first steps towards representation learning for graph-based abstract code generation.</p></details> |  |
| **[Do Large Language Models Respect Contracts? Evaluating and Enforcing Contract-Adherence in Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12047v2)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prevailing code generation benchmarks, such as HumanEval+ and MBPP+, primarily evaluate large language models (LLMs) with pass@k on functional correctness using well-formed inputs. However, they ignore a crucial aspect of real-world software: adherence to contracts-the preconditions and validity constraints that dictate how ill-formed inputs must be rejected. This critical oversight means that existing benchmarks fail to measure, and models consequently fail to generate, truly robust and reliable code snippets. We introduce PACT, a program assessment and contract-adherence evaluation framework, to bridge this gap. PACT is the first framework designed to systematically evaluate and enhance contract-adherence in LLM-generated code snippets alongside functional correctness. PACT's contributions are threefold: First, it provides a comprehensive test-suite corpus focused on contract violations, extending HumanEval+ and MBPP+. Second, it enables a systematic analysis of code generation under varied prompting conditions. This analysis demonstrates that augmenting prompts with contract-violating test cases significantly enhance a model's ability to respect contracts compared to using contract description alone. Finally, it introduces novel metrics to rigorously quantify contract adherence in both test generation and code generation. By revealing critical errors that conventional benchmarks overlook, PACT provides the rigorous and interpretable metrics to evaluate the robustness of LLM-generated code snippets in both functionality and contract-adherence. Our code and data are available at https://github.com/suhanmen/PACT.</p></details> | <details><summary>21 pa...</summary><p>21 pages, 12 figures, 3 tables</p></details> |

Nonetheless, many approaches still struggle to scale to diverse environments, as they often rely on large annotated datasets and offer limited interpretability.In this work, we introduce EmbodiedCoder, a training-free framework for open-world mobile robot manipulation that leverages coding models to directly generate executable robot trajectories. By grounding high-level instructions in code, EmbodiedCoder enables flexible object geometry parameterization and manipulation trajectory synthesis without additional data collection or fine-tuning.This coding-based paradigm provides a transparent and generalizable way to connect perception with manipulation. Experiments on real mobile robots show that EmbodiedCoder achieves robust performance across diverse long-term tasks and generalizes effectively to novel objects and environments.Our results demonstrate an interpretable approach for bridging high-level reasoning and low-level control, moving beyond fixed primitives toward versatile robot intelligence.

However, these retrieval modules commonly use semantic search, requiring substantial computational resources for training and hosting these embedded models, making them infeasible to integrate into lightweight applications such as in-IDE AI-based code completion. In this solution paper, we prove that using keyword-search is sufficient to retrieve relevant and useful code context inside large codebases, without the need for extensive GPU resources. The usefulness of code contexts found by our solution is demonstrated through their completion results on the Code Context Competition's benchmark, reaching 0.748 and 0.725 chRF scores on Kotlin and Python tracks, respectively.</p></details> | <details><summary>4 pag...</summary><p>4 pages, 3 figures, 4 tables.

| **[ARM2: Adaptive Reasoning Model with Vision Understanding and Executable Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08163v3)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Reasoning Models (LRMs) often suffer from the ``over-thinking'' problem, generating unnecessarily long reasoning on simple tasks. Some strategies have been proposed to mitigate this issue, such as length penalties or routing mechanisms, but they are typically heuristic and task-specific, lacking a general framework for adaptive reasoning. In this paper, we present ARM2, a unified model that adaptively balances reasoning performance and efficiency across multiple formats through a reinforcement learning framework augmented with length-aware optimization. Beyond conventional natural language inference, ARM2 integrates vision understanding, extending its applicability to multimodal. Moreover, ARM2 integrates executable code into reasoning, enabling substantial reductions in token cost while preserving task performance compared to long CoT. Experiments demonstrate that ARM2 achieves performance on par with traditional reasoning models trained with GRPO, while reducing token usage by over 70% on average. We further conduct extensive analyses to validate the effectiveness of ARM2 and the soundness of its design.</p></details> | Work in Progress |
| **[Reinforcement Learning for Out-of-Distribution Reasoning in LLMs: An Empirical Study on Diagnosis-Related Group Coding](http://arxiv.org/abs/2505.21908v2)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Diagnosis-Related Group (DRG) codes are essential for hospital reimbursement and operations but require labor-intensive assignment. Large Language Models (LLMs) struggle with DRG coding due to the out-of-distribution (OOD) nature of the task: pretraining corpora rarely contain private clinical or billing data. We introduce DRG-Sapphire, which uses large-scale reinforcement learning (RL) for automated DRG coding from clinical notes. Built on Qwen2.5-7B and trained with Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) using rule-based rewards, DRG-Sapphire introduces a series of RL enhancements to address domain-specific challenges not seen in previous mathematical tasks. Our model achieves state-of-the-art accuracy on the MIMIC-IV benchmark and generates physician-validated reasoning for DRG assignments, significantly enhancing explainability. Our study further sheds light on broader challenges of applying RL to knowledge-intensive, OOD tasks. We observe that RL performance scales approximately linearly with the logarithm of the number of supervised fine-tuning (SFT) examples, suggesting that RL effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by the domain knowledge encoded in the base model. For OOD tasks like DRG coding, strong RL performance requires sufficient knowledge infusion prior to RL. Consequently, scaling SFT may be more effective and computationally efficient than scaling RL alone for such tasks.</p></details> |  |

Our system integrates a refractive lens eyepiece with a novel wavefront coding diffractive optical element, operating in tandem with a pre-processing convolutional neural network. We employ end-to-end learning to jointly optimize the wavefront-coding optics and the image pre-processing module. To implement this approach, we develop a differentiable retinal image formation model that accounts for limiting aperture and chromatic aberrations introduced by the eye optics. We further integrate the neural transfer function and the contrast sensitivity function into the loss model to account for related perceptual effects. To tackle off-axis distortions, we incorporate position dependency into the pre-processing module. In addition to conducting rigorous analysis based on simulations, we also fabricate the designed diffractive optical element and build a benchtop setup, demonstrating accommodation-invariance for depth ranges of up to four diopters.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Survey of Vibe Coding with Large Language Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12399v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The advancement of large language models (LLMs) has catalyzed a paradigm shift from code generation assistance to autonomous coding agents, enabling a novel development methodology termed "Vibe Coding" where developers validate AI-generated implementations through outcome observation rather than line-by-line code comprehension. Despite its transformative potential, the effectiveness of this emergent paradigm remains under-explored, with empirical evidence revealing unexpected productivity losses and fundamental challenges in human-AI collaboration. To address this gap, this survey provides the first comprehensive and systematic review of Vibe Coding with large language models, establishing both theoretical foundations and practical frameworks for this transformative development approach. Drawing from systematic analysis of over 1000 research papers, we survey the entire vibe coding ecosystem, examining critical infrastructure components including LLMs for coding, LLM-based coding agent, development environment of coding agent, and feedback mechanisms. We first introduce Vibe Coding as a formal discipline by formalizing it through a Constrained Markov Decision Process that captures the dynamic triadic relationship among human developers, software projects, and coding agents. Building upon this theoretical foundation, we then synthesize existing practices into five distinct development models: Unconstrained Automation, Iterative Conversational Collaboration, Planning-Driven, Test-Driven, and Context-Enhanced Models, thus providing the first comprehensive taxonomy in this domain. Critically, our analysis reveals that successful Vibe Coding depends not merely on agent capabilities but on systematic context engineering, well-established development environments, and human-agent collaborative development models.</p></details> |  |
| **[iCodeReviewer: Improving Secure Code Review with Mixture of Prompts](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12186v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code review is an essential process to ensure the quality of software that identifies potential software issues at an early stage of software development. Among all software issues, security issues are the most important to identify, as they can easily lead to severe software crashes and service disruptions. Recent research efforts have been devoted to automated approaches to reduce the manual efforts required in the secure code review process. Despite the progress, current automated approaches on secure code review, including static analysis, deep learning models, and prompting approaches, still face the challenges of limited precision and coverage, and a lack of comprehensive evaluation. To mitigate these challenges, we propose iCodeReviewer, which is an automated secure code review approach based on large language models (LLMs). iCodeReviewer leverages a novel mixture-of-prompts architecture that incorporates many prompt experts to improve the coverage of security issues. Each prompt expert is a dynamic prompt pipeline to check the existence of a specific security issue. iCodeReviewer also implements an effective routing algorithm to activate only necessary prompt experts based on the code features in the input program, reducing the false positives induced by LLM hallucination. Experiment results in our internal dataset demonstrate the effectiveness of iCodeReviewer in security issue identification and localization with an F1 of 63.98%. The review comments generated by iCodeReviewer also achieve a high acceptance rate up to 84% when it is deployed in production environments.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hardware-aware Coding Function Design for Compressive Single-Photon 3D Cameras](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12123v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Single-photon cameras are becoming increasingly popular in time-of-flight 3D imaging because they can time-tag individual photons with extreme resolution. However, their performance is susceptible to hardware limitations, such as system bandwidth, maximum laser power, sensor data rates, and in-sensor memory and compute resources. Compressive histograms were recently introduced as a solution to the challenge of data rates through an online in-sensor compression of photon timestamp data. Although compressive histograms work within limited in-sensor memory and computational resources, they underperform when subjected to real-world illumination hardware constraints. To address this, we present a constrained optimization approach for designing practical coding functions for compressive single-photon 3D imaging. Using gradient descent, we jointly optimize an illumination and coding matrix (i.e., the coding functions) that adheres to hardware constraints. We show through extensive simulations that our coding functions consistently outperform traditional coding designs under both bandwidth and peak power constraints. This advantage is particularly pronounced in systems constrained by peak power. Finally, we show that our approach adapts to arbitrary parameterized impulse responses by evaluating it on a real-world system with a non-ideal impulse response function.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE TPAMI Special Issue</p></details> |
| **[An Adaptive Edge-Guided Dual-Network Framework for Fast QR Code Motion Deblurring](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12098v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Unlike general image deblurring that prioritizes perceptual quality, QR code deblurring focuses on ensuring successful decoding. QR codes are characterized by highly structured patterns with sharp edges, a robust prior for restoration. Yet existing deep learning methods rarely exploit these priors explicitly. To address this gap, we propose the Edge-Guided Attention Block (EGAB), which embeds explicit edge priors into a Transformer architecture. Based on EGAB, we develop Edge-Guided Restormer (EG-Restormer), an effective network that significantly boosts the decoding rate of severely blurred QR codes. For mildly blurred inputs, we design the Lightweight and Efficient Network (LENet) for fast deblurring. We further integrate these two networks into an Adaptive Dual-network (ADNet), which dynamically selects the suitable network based on input blur severity, making it ideal for resource-constrained mobile devices. Extensive experiments show that our EG-Restormer and ADNet achieve state-of-the-art performance with a competitive speed. Project page: https://github.com/leejianping/ADNet</p></details> |  |
| **[Enhancing Neural Code Representation with Additional Context](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12082v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program comprehension underpins many software engineering tasks, from code summarisation to clone detection. Recent deep learning models achieve strong results but typically rely on source code alone, overlooking contextual information such as version history or structural relationships. This limits their ability to capture how code evolves and operates. We conduct an empirical study on how enriching code representations with such contextual signals affects neural model performance on key comprehension tasks. Two downstream tasks, code clone detection and code summarisation, are evaluated using SeSaMe (1,679 Java methods) and CodeSearchNet (63,259 methods). Five representative models (CodeBERT, GraphCodeBERT, CodeT5, PLBART, ASTNN) are fine-tuned under code-only and context-augmented settings. Results show that context generally improves performance: version history consistently boosts clone detection (e.g., CodeT5 +15.92% F1) and summarisation (e.g., GraphCodeBERT +5.56% METEOR), while call-graph effects vary by model and task. Combining multiple contexts yields further gains (up to +21.48% macro-F1). Human evaluation on 100 Java snippets confirms that context-augmented summaries are significantly preferred for Accuracy and Content Adequacy (p <= 0.026; |delta| up to 0.55). These findings highlight the potential of contextual signals to enhance code comprehension and open new directions for optimising contextual encoding in neural SE models.</p></details> | <details><summary>34 pa...</summary><p>34 pages, 7 figures, 11 tables</p></details> |
| **[Structure-Preserving Error-Correcting Codes for Polynomial Frames](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13882v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Modern FFT/NTT analytics, coded computation, and privacy-preserving ML interface routinely move polynomial frames across NICs, storage, and accelerators. However, even rare silent data corruption (SDC) can flip a few ring coefficients and cascade through downstream arithmetic. Conventional defenses are ill-matched to current low-latency pipelines: detect-and-retransmit adds RTTs, while byte-stream ECC ignores the algebraic structure and forces format conversions. To that end, we propose a structure-preserving reliability layer that operates in the encoded data's original polynomial ring, adds a small amount of systematic redundancy, and corrects symbol errors/flagged erasures without round-trip or format changes. We construct two complementary schemes: one for odd length $N_{odd}$ via a Hensel-lifted BCH ideal with an idempotent encoder, and one for power-of-two length $N_{2^m}$ via a repeated-root negacyclic code with derivative-style decoding. In particular, to stay robust against clustered errors, a ring automorphism provides in-place interleaving to disperse bursts. Implementation wise, on four frame sizes $N\!=\!1024, 2048, 4096, 8192$, we meet a per-frame failure target of $10^{-9}$ at symbol error rates $10^{-6}\text{--}10^{-5}$ with $t\!=\!8\text{--}9$, incurring only $0.20\%\text{--}1.56\%$ overhead and tolerating $\sim\!32\text{--}72$\,B unknown-error bursts (roughly doubled when flagged as erasures) after interleaving. By aligning error correction with ring semantics, we take a practical step toward deployable robustness for polynomial-frame computations from an algebraic coding perspective.</p></details> |  |
| **[K-ASTRO: Structure-Aware Adaptation of LLMs for Code Vulnerability Detection](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.08067v3)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming software engineering tasks, including code vulnerability detection-a critical area of software security. However, existing methods often rely on resource-intensive models or graph-based techniques, limiting their accessibility and practicality. This paper introduces K-ASTRO, a lightweight Transformer model that combines semantic embeddings from LLMs with structural features of Abstract Syntax Trees (ASTs) to improve both efficiency and accuracy in code vulnerability detection. Our approach introduces an AST-based augmentation technique inspired by mutation testing, a structure-aware attention mechanism that incorporates augmented AST features, and a joint adaptation pipeline to unify code semantics and syntax. Experimental results on three large-scale datasets, including BigVul, DiverseVul, and PrimeVul-demonstrate state-of-the-art performance while enabling rapid inference on CPUs with minimal training time. By offering a scalable, interpretable, and efficient solution, K-ASTRO bridges the gap between LLM advancements and practical software vulnerability detection, providing open-sourced tools to foster further research.</p></details> |  |
| **[TopoAlign: A Framework for Aligning Code to Math via Topological Decomposition](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11944v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) excel at both informal and formal (e.g. Lean 4) mathematical reasoning but still struggle with autoformalisation, the task of transforming informal into formal mathematical statements. Autoformalisation helps pair the informal reasoning of LLMs with formal proof assistants which enable machine-verifiable generation and mitigate hallucinations. Yet, the performance of current Math LLMs is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale corpora, particularly those containing pairs of informal and formal statements. Although current models are trained to generate code from natural language instructions, structural and syntactic differences between these and formal mathematics limit effective transfer learning. We propose TopoAlign, a framework that unlocks widely available code repositories as training resources for Math LLMs. TopoAlign decomposes code into docstrings, main functions, and dependency functions, and reassembles these components into analogues that structurally mirror formal statements. This produces structurally aligned code data that can be used for training Math LLMs without requiring additional human annotation. We train two state-of-the-art models, DeepSeek-Math and Herald, and evaluate them on the minif2f, Putnam, and ProofNet benchmarks. TopoAlign provides substantial gains for DeepSeek-Math, improving performance by 17.77% on BEq@10 and 68.82% on typecheck@10. Despite introducing no new mathematical knowledge, our framework achieves gains of 0.12% and 1.09% for Herald on BEq@10 and typecheck@10, respectively, demonstrating that training on aligned code data is beneficial even for specialized models.</p></details> |  |

While Knowledge Components (KCs) provide a foundation for such modeling, automated KC extraction from student code is inherently challenging due to insufficient explainability of discovered KCs and the open-endedness of programming problems with significant structural variability across student solutions and complex interactions among programming concepts. In this work, we propose a novel, explainable framework for automated KC discovery through pattern-based KCs: recurring structural patterns within student code that capture the specific programming patterns and language constructs that students must master. Toward this, we train a Variational Autoencoder to generate important representative patterns from student code guided by an explainable, attention-based code representation model that identifies important correct and incorrect pattern implementations from student code. These patterns are then clustered to form pattern-based KCs. We evaluate our KCs using two well-established methods informed by Cognitive Science: learning curve analysis and Deep Knowledge Tracing (DKT). Experimental results demonstrate meaningful learning trajectories and significant improvements in DKT predictive performance over traditional KT methods. This work advances knowledge modeling in CS education by providing an automated, scalable, and explainable framework for identifying granular code patterns and algorithmic constructs, essential for student learning.</p></details> |  |

Most LLMs and VLMs are constrained to text-only reasoning chains, while multimodal unified models that can generate interleaved text and images lack the necessary precision and controllability for such tasks. To address this, we propose CodePlot-CoT, a code-driven Chain-of-Thought paradigm for "thinking with images" in mathematics. Our approach leverages the VLM to generate text reasoning as well as executable plotting code, which is then rendered into images as "visual thought", to solve mathematical problems. To achieve this, we first construct Math-VR, the first large-scale, bilingual dataset and benchmark for Mathematics problems with Visual Reasoning, comprising 178K samples. Second, to create high-quality training data, we develop a state-of-the-art image-to-code converter specialized for parsing complex mathematical figures into codes. Finally, using these training data, we train the CodePlot-CoT model for solving mathematical problems. Experimental results show that our model achieves up to 21% increase over base model on our new benchmark, fully validating the efficacy of our proposed code-driven reasoning paradigm. Our work opens a new direction for multimodal mathematical reasoning and provides the community with the first large-scale dataset, comprehensive benchmark, and strong approach for such problems. To facilitate future research, we make our datasets, code, and pretrained models publicly available at https://github.com/HKU-MMLab/Math-VR-CodePlot-CoT.</p></details> |  |

These component codes come with low-complexity maximum likelihood (ML) decoding which, in turn, enables efficient successive cancellation (SC)-based decoding. As a result, the proposed optimally recursively concatenated simplex (ORCAS) codes achieve a performance that is at least as good as that of polar codes. For practical parameters, the proposed construction significantly outperforms polar codes in terms of block error rate by up to 0.5 dB while maintaining similar decoding complexity. Furthermore, the codes offer greater flexibility in codeword length than conventional polar codes.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, 2 figures.

We present \textit{CodeWatcher}, a lightweight, unobtrusive client-server system designed to capture fine-grained interaction events from within the Visual Studio Code (VS Code) editor. \textit{CodeWatcher} logs semantically meaningful events such as insertions made by CGTs, deletions, copy-paste actions, and focus shifts, enabling continuous monitoring of developer activity without modifying user workflows.

We present ReLook, an agentic, vision-grounded reinforcement learning framework that empowers an agent to close a robust generate--diagnose--refine loop by invoking a multimodal LLM (MLLM) as a tool. During training, the agent uses the MLLM-in-the-loop both as a visual critic--scoring code with screenshots--and as a source of actionable, vision-grounded feedback; a strict zero-reward rule for invalid renders anchors renderability and prevents reward hacking. To prevent behavioral collapse, we introduce Forced Optimization, a strict acceptance rule that admits only improving revisions, yielding monotonically better trajectories. At inference, we decouple the critic and run a lightweight, critic-free self-edit cycle, keeping latency comparable to base decoding while retaining most of the gains. Across three widely used benchmarks, ReLook consistently outperforms strong baselines in vision-grounded front-end code generation, highlighting the benefits of agentic perception, visual rewards, and training-inference decoupling.</p></details> |  |

We first design synthetic tasks isolating intra-neuron inter-spike intervals and cross-neuron synchrony under matched spike counts. On more complex spike-based speech recognition datasets (Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) and Spiking Speech Commands (SSC), we construct variants where spike count information is eliminated and only timing information remains, and show that Surrogate GD-trained SNNs are able to perform significantly above chance whereas purely rate-based models perform at chance level. We further evaluate robustness under biologically inspired perturbations -- including Gaussian jitter per spike or per-neuron, and spike deletion -- revealing consistent but perturbation-specific degradation. Networks show a sharp performance drop when spike sequences are reversed in time, with a larger drop in performance from SNNs trained with delays, indicating that these networks are more human-like in terms of behaviour. To facilitate further studies of temporal coding, we have released our modified SHD and SSC datasets.</p></details> |  |
| **[List Decoding Reed--Solomon Codes in the Lee, Euclidean, and Other Metrics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11453v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Reed--Solomon error-correcting codes are ubiquitous across computer science and information theory, with applications in cryptography, computational complexity, communication and storage systems, and more. Most works on efficient error correction for these codes, like the celebrated Berlekamp--Welch unique decoder and the (Guruswami--)Sudan list decoders, are focused on measuring error in the Hamming metric, which simply counts the number of corrupted codeword symbols. However, for some applications, other metrics that depend on the specific values of the errors may be more appropriate. This work gives a polynomial-time algorithm that list decodes (generalized) Reed--Solomon codes over prime fields in $\ell_p$ (semi)metrics, for any $0 < p \leq 2$. Compared to prior algorithms for the Lee ($\ell_1$) and Euclidean ($\ell_2$) metrics, ours decodes to arbitrarily large distances (for correspondingly small rates), and has better distance-rate tradeoffs for all decoding distances above some moderate thresholds. We also prove lower bounds on the $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$ minimum distances of a certain natural subclass of GRS codes, which establishes that our list decoder is actually a unique decoder for many parameters of interest. Finally, we analyze our algorithm's performance under random Laplacian and Gaussian errors, and show that it supports even larger rates than for corresponding amounts of worst-case error in $\ell_{1}$ and $\ell_{2}$ (respectively).</p></details> | 26 pages, 1 figure |
| **[Large Language Models Are Effective Code Watermarkers](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11251v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The widespread use of large language models (LLMs) and open-source code has raised ethical and security concerns regarding the distribution and attribution of source code, including unauthorized redistribution, license violations, and misuse of code for malicious purposes. Watermarking has emerged as a promising solution for source attribution, but existing techniques rely heavily on hand-crafted transformation rules, abstract syntax tree (AST) manipulation, or task-specific training, limiting their scalability and generality across languages. Moreover, their robustness against attacks remains limited. To address these limitations, we propose CodeMark-LLM, an LLM-driven watermarking framework that embeds watermark into source code without compromising its semantics or readability. CodeMark-LLM consists of two core components: (i) Semantically Consistent Embedding module that applies functionality-preserving transformations to encode watermark bits, and (ii) Differential Comparison Extraction module that identifies the applied transformations by comparing the original and watermarked code. Leveraging the cross-lingual generalization ability of LLM, CodeMark-LLM avoids language-specific engineering and training pipelines. Extensive experiments across diverse programming languages and attack scenarios demonstrate its robustness, effectiveness, and scalability.</p></details> |  |
| **[Evaluating Line-level Localization Ability of Learning-based Code Vulnerability Detection Models](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11202v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>To address the extremely concerning problem of software vulnerability, system security is often entrusted to Machine Learning (ML) algorithms. Despite their now established detection capabilities, such models are limited by design to flagging the entire input source code function as vulnerable, rather than precisely localizing the concerned code lines. However, the detection granularity is crucial to support human operators during software development, ensuring that such predictions reflect the true code semantics to help debug, evaluate, and fix the detected vulnerabilities. To address this issue, recent work made progress toward improving the detector's localization ability, thus narrowing down the vulnerability detection "window" and providing more fine-grained predictions. Such approaches, however, implicitly disregard the presence of spurious correlations and biases in the data, which often predominantly influence the performance of ML algorithms. In this work, we investigate how detectors comply with this requirement by proposing an explainability-based evaluation procedure. Our approach, defined as Detection Alignment (DA), quantifies the agreement between the input source code lines that most influence the prediction and the actual localization of the vulnerability as per the ground truth. Through DA, which is model-agnostic and adaptable to different detection tasks, not limited to our use case, we analyze multiple learning-based vulnerability detectors and datasets. As a result, we show how the predictions of such models are consistently biased by non-vulnerable lines, ultimately highlighting the high impact of biases and spurious correlations.

It does so by adding external data into the LLM's context. We develop a new class of black-box attack, RAG-Pull, that inserts hidden UTF characters into queries or external code repositories, redirecting retrieval toward malicious code, thereby breaking the models' safety alignment. We observe that query and code perturbations alone can shift retrieval toward attacker-controlled snippets, while combined query-and-target perturbations achieve near-perfect success. Once retrieved, these snippets introduce exploitable vulnerabilities such as remote code execution and SQL injection. RAG-Pull's minimal perturbations can alter the model's safety alignment and increase preference towards unsafe code, therefore opening up a new class of attacks on LLMs.</p></details> |  |

However, their outputs often contain subtle but critical vulnerabilities, posing significant risks when deployed in security-sensitive or mission-critical systems. This paper introduces TypePilot, an agentic AI framework designed to enhance the security and robustness of LLM-generated code by leveraging strongly typed and verifiable languages, using Scala as a representative example. We evaluate the effectiveness of our approach in two settings: formal verification with the Stainless framework and general-purpose secure code generation. Our experiments with leading open-source LLMs reveal that while direct code generation often fails to enforce safety constraints, just as naive prompting for more secure code, our type-focused agentic pipeline substantially mitigates input validation and injection vulnerabilities. The results demonstrate the potential of structured, type-guided LLM workflows to improve the SotA of the trustworthiness of automated code generation in high-assurance domains.</p></details> |  |
| **[SaraCoder: Orchestrating Semantic and Structural Cues for Resource-Optimized Repository-Level Code Completion](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.10068v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Despite Retrieval-Augmented Generation improving code completion, traditional retrieval methods struggle with information redundancy and a lack of diversity within limited context windows. To solve this, we propose a resource-optimized retrieval augmentation method, SaraCoder. It maximizes information diversity and representativeness in a limited context window, significantly boosting the accuracy and reliability of repository-level code completion. Its core Hierarchical Feature Optimization module systematically refines candidates by distilling deep semantic relationships, pruning exact duplicates, assessing structural similarity with a novel graph-based metric that weighs edits by their topological importance, and reranking results to maximize both relevance and diversity. Furthermore, an External-Aware Identifier Disambiguator module accurately resolves cross-file symbol ambiguity via dependency analysis. Extensive experiments on the challenging CrossCodeEval and RepoEval-Updated benchmarks demonstrate that SaraCoder outperforms existing baselines across multiple programming languages and models. Our work proves that systematically refining retrieval results across multiple dimensions provides a new paradigm for building more accurate and resource-optimized repository-level code completion systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[RepoSummary: Feature-Oriented Summarization and Documentation Generation for Code Repositories](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11039v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Repository summarization is a crucial research question in development and maintenance for software engineering. Existing repository summarization techniques primarily focus on summarizing code according to the directory tree, which is insufficient for tracing high-level features to the methods that collaboratively implement them. To address these limitations, we propose RepoSummary, a feature-oriented code repository summarization approach that simultaneously generates repository documentation automatically. Furthermore, it establishes more accurate traceability links from functional features to the corresponding code elements, enabling developers to rapidly locate relevant methods and files during code comprehension and maintenance. Comprehensive experiments against the state-of-the-art baseline (HGEN) demonstrate that RepoSummary achieves higher feature coverage and more accurate traceability. On average, it increases the rate of completely covered features in manual documentation from 61.2% to 71.1%, improves file-level traceability recall from 29.9% to 53.0%, and generates documentation that is more conceptually consistent, easier to understand, and better formatted than that produced by existing approaches.</p></details> |  |
| **[Bridging Developer Instructions and Code Completion Through Instruction-Aware Fill-in-the-Middle Paradigm](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.24637v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have significantly advanced code completion, yet they often fail when the developer's intent is underspecified in the code context. To address this, developers usually add natural language instructions (e.g., comments) into the code context to clarify their intent. However, existing code LLMs applied for code completion systems merely undergo a fill-in-the-middle (FIM) pre-training, which struggles to leverage this information effectively due to the lack of instruction-like training data. Existing instruction-tuning techniques, improving instruction-following in general code generation, paradoxically degrades FIM performance, forcing a trade-off between instruction-following and infilling capabilities. To address this gap, we introduce Instruction-aware Fill-in-the-Middle (IFIM), an instruction-tuning method specifically designed to enhance FIM code completion models. IFIM extends the conventional FIM training objective by incorporating an explicit instruction section into the input, enabling the model to learn from (prefix, instruction, suffix) triplets. This approach allows the model to effectively leverage developer-provided directives while preserving its core completion abilities when no instructions are present. To facilitate this, we constructed a large-scale dataset by using GPT-4o to generate concise, intent-focused instructions for code infilling examples. We evaluated IFIM by applying it to two popular base models, Deepseek-Coder and Qwen2.5-Coder, on the benchmarks derived from HumanEval-infilling and RepoMasterEval. The results demonstrate that IFIM significantly improves instruction-following capabilities, boosting the Pass@1 score from 84.6% to 93.6%. Moreover, this enhancement does not compromise the models' original performance on FIM code completion tasks with no instructions provided.</p></details> |  |
| **[Recovery Performance of PhaseLift for Phase Retrieval from Coded Diffraction Patterns](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.10300v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The PhaseLift algorithm is an effective convex method for solving the phase retrieval problem from Fourier measurements with coded diffraction patterns (CDP). While exact reconstruction guarantees are well-established in the noiseless case, the stability of recovery under noise remains less well understood. In particular, when the measurements are corrupted by an additive noise vector $\vw \in \R^m$, existing recovery bounds scale on the order of $\norm{\vw}$, which is conjectured to be suboptimal. More recently, Soltanolkotabi conjectured that the optimal PhaseLift recovery bound should scale with the average noise magnitude, that is, on the order of $\norm{\vw}/\sqrt m$. However, establishing this theoretically is considerably more challenging and has remained an open problem. In this paper, we focus on this conjecture and prove that under adversarial noise, the recovery error of PhaseLift is bounded by $O\xkh{ \sqrt{\frac{\norm{\vw}\log n }{\sqrt m}}}\norm{\vx_0}$. Here, $\vx_0 \in \C^n$ is the signals we aim to recover. Moreover, for mean-zero sub-Gaussian noise vector $\vw \in \R^m$, a upper error bound and its corresponding minimax lower bound are also provided. Our results represent a significant step toward Soltanolkotabi's conjecture, offering new insights into the stability of PhaseLift under noisy CDP measurements.</p></details> |  |

They can not only reduce the size of network alphabet but also detect and correct more errors. Based on the duality theory of sum-rank codes [Byrne, Gluesing-Luerssen, Ravagnani, IEEE TIT, 2021] and those related theory of rank-metric codes, it is significant to study self-dual codes and linear complementary dual (LCD) codes in sum-rank metric. In this paper, we introduce the notion of self-dual codes and LCD codes in sum-rank metric, and obtain two methods of constructing self-dual sum-rank codes and LCD sum-rank codes from Euclidean self-dual codes and Euclidean LCD codes. Some examples of cyclic self-dual sum-rank codes and cyclic LCD sum-rank codes with good parameters are provided. In addition, we prove that there exist asymptotically good self-dual sum-rank codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[Benchmarking Correctness and Security in Multi-Turn Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13859v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI coding assistants powered by large language models (LLMs) have transformed software development, significantly boosting productivity. While existing benchmarks evaluate the correctness and security of LLM-generated code, they are typically limited to single-turn tasks that do not reflect the iterative nature of real-world development. We introduce MT-Sec, the first benchmark to systematically evaluate both correctness and security in multi-turn coding scenarios. We construct this using a synthetic data pipeline that transforms existing single-turn tasks into semantically aligned multi-turn interaction sequences, allowing reuse of original test suites while modeling the complexity of real-world coding processes. We evaluate 32 open- and closed-source models, and three agent-scaffolding on MT-Sec and observe a consistent 20-27% drop in "correct and secure" outputs from single-turn to multi-turn settings -- even among state-of-the-art models. Beyond full-program generation, we also evaluate models on multi-turn code-diff generation -- an unexplored yet practically relevant setting -- and find that models perform worse here, with increased rates of functionally incorrect and insecure outputs. Finally, we find that while agent scaffoldings boost single-turn code generation performance, they are not quite as effective in multi-turn evaluations. Together, these findings highlight the need for benchmarks that jointly evaluate correctness and security in multi-turn, real-world coding workflows.</p></details> |  |
| **[Output Format Biases in the Evaluation of Large Language Models for Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.17214v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation between programming languages (PLs) is a critical task in software engineering, facilitating the modernization of legacy systems, ensuring cross-platform compatibility, and enhancing software performance. Most existing studies instruct LLMs to perform code translation and evaluate their performance by either running the generated outputs through test suites or comparing them to reference outputs (ground truth). These outputs, however, may contain not only executable source code but also additional non-code elements, such as natural language explanations or formatting tokens. We refer to the combination of source code and non-code elements as the output format. It is crucial to understand and address variations in output format, as non-code elements can interfere with evaluation metrics, resulting in biased assessments of model performance and comparisons. We conduct an empirical analysis of the outputs from eleven instruct-tuned open-source LLMs, across five PLs: C, C++, Go, Java, and Python. The results show that between 26.4% and 73.7% of outputs produced by our evaluated LLMs necessitate post-processing. To mitigate output format bias, we propose a strategic combination of prompt engineering and regular expressions that effectively extracts source code from mixed-format outputs, enabling the eleven open-source models to achieve an average Code Extraction Success Rate (CSR) of 92.73%. Our empirical study confirms that output format bias affects widely used execution-based metrics, i.e., Computational Accuracy (CA), and text-based metrics, i.e., BLEU, CodeBLEU and CrystalBLEU. Additionally, we test five closed-source LLMs and observe that they also generate varying distributions of output formats, which could lead to output format biases. Our results highlight the need to mitigate the output format bias to enable reliable evaluations in LLMs for code translation.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This version (v2) is a journal extension of our previous conference submission that was accepted into the 2024 IEEE/ACM First International Conference on AI Foundation Models and Software Engineering (Forge 2024), which includes new experiments and results</p></details> |

A key challenge in this space is the continual need to migrate and modernize codebases in response to evolving software ecosystems. Traditionally, such migrations have relied on rule-based systems and human intervention. With the advent of powerful large language models (LLMs), AI-driven agentic frameworks offer a promising alternative-but their effectiveness has not been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we introduce FreshBrew, a novel benchmark for evaluating AI agents on project-level Java migrations, with a specific focus on measuring an agent's ability to preserve program semantics and avoid reward hacking, which we argue requires projects with high test coverage for a rigorous and reliable evaluation. We benchmark several state-of-the-art LLMs, and compare their performance against established rule-based tools. Our evaluation of AI agents on this benchmark of 228 repositories shows that the top-performing model, Gemini 2.5 Flash, can successfully migrate 52.3 percent of projects to JDK 17. Our empirical analysis reveals novel insights into the critical strengths and limitations of current agentic approaches, offering actionable insights into their real-world applicability. Our empirical study reveals failure modes of current AI agents in realistic Java modernization tasks, providing a foundation for evaluating trustworthy code-migration systems. By releasing FreshBrew, we aim to facilitate rigorous, reproducible evaluation and catalyze progress in AI-driven codebase modernization.</p></details> | 18 pages, 12 figures |

However, existing methods are often computationally expensive, and the field lacks standardized benchmarks for fair comparison. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a twofold contribution. First, we develop and open-source FJNDF-Pytorch, a unified benchmark for frequency-domain JND-Guided pre-filters. Second, leveraging this platform, we propose a complete learning framework for a novel, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art compression efficiency, consistently outperforming competitors across multiple datasets and encoders. In terms of computational cost, our model is exceptionally lightweight, requiring only 7.15 GFLOPs to process a 1080p image, which is merely 14.1% of the cost of recent lightweight network. Our work presents a robust, state-of-the-art solution that excels in both performance and efficiency, supported by a reproducible research platform.

| **[On the Weight Spectrum of Rate-Compatible Polar Codes](http://arxiv.org/abs/2410.19242v3)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The weight spectrum plays a crucial role in the performance of error-correcting codes. Despite substantial theoretical exploration of polar codes with mother code length, a framework for the weight spectrum of rate-compatible polar codes remains elusive. In this paper, we address this gap by presenting the theoretical results for enumerating the number of minimum-weight codewords for quasi-uniform punctured, Wang-Liu shortened, and bit-reversal shortened decreasing polar codes. Additionally, we propose efficient algorithms for computing the average spectrum of random upper-triangular pre-transformed shortened and punctured polar codes. Notably, our algorithms operate with polynomial complexity relative to the code length. Simulation results affirm that our findings yield a precise estimation of the performance of rate-compatible polar codes.</p></details> |  |
| **[ECO: Enhanced Code Optimization via Performance-Aware Prompting for Code-LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10517v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code runtime optimization-the task of rewriting a given code to a faster one-remains challenging, as it requires reasoning about performance trade-offs involving algorithmic and structural choices. Recent approaches employ code-LLMs with slow-fast code pairs provided as optimization guidance, but such pair-based methods obscure the causal factors of performance gains and often lead to superficial pattern imitation rather than genuine performance reasoning. We introduce ECO, a performance-aware prompting framework for code optimization. ECO first distills runtime optimization instructions (ROIs) from reference slow-fast code pairs; Each ROI describes root causes of inefficiency and the rationales that drive performance improvements. For a given input code, ECO in parallel employs (i) a symbolic advisor to produce a bottleneck diagnosis tailored to the code, and (ii) an ROI retriever to return related ROIs. These two outputs are then composed into a performance-aware prompt, providing actionable guidance for code-LLMs. ECO's prompts are model-agnostic, require no fine-tuning, and can be easily prepended to any code-LLM prompt. Our empirical studies highlight that ECO prompting significantly improves code-LLMs' ability to generate efficient code, achieving speedups of up to 7.81x while minimizing correctness loss.</p></details> |  |
| **[Population-Coded Spiking Neural Networks for High-Dimensional Robotic Control](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10516v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Energy-efficient and high-performance motor control remains a critical challenge in robotics, particularly for high-dimensional continuous control tasks with limited onboard resources. While Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) has achieved remarkable results, its computational demands and energy consumption limit deployment in resource-constrained environments. This paper introduces a novel framework combining population-coded Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) with DRL to address these challenges. Our approach leverages the event-driven, asynchronous computation of SNNs alongside the robust policy optimization capabilities of DRL, achieving a balance between energy efficiency and control performance. Central to this framework is the Population-coded Spiking Actor Network (PopSAN), which encodes high-dimensional observations into neuronal population activities and enables optimal policy learning through gradient-based updates. We evaluate our method on the Isaac Gym platform using the PixMC benchmark with complex robotic manipulation tasks. Experimental results on the Franka robotic arm demonstrate that our approach achieves energy savings of up to 96.10% compared to traditional Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) while maintaining comparable control performance. The trained SNN policies exhibit robust finger position tracking with minimal deviation from commanded trajectories and stable target height maintenance during pick-and-place operations. These results position population-coded SNNs as a promising solution for energy-efficient, high-performance robotic control in resource-constrained applications, paving the way for scalable deployment in real-world robotics systems.</p></details> |  |

Such a set $C$ is often referred to as a code in the literature of identification problems. In this article, we introduce a new separation property, called full-separation, as it combines aspects of the two well-studied properties of closed- and open-separation. We study it in combination with both domination and total-domination and call the resulting codes full-separating dominating codes (or FD-codes for short) and full-separating total-dominating codes (or FTD-codes for short), respectively. Incidentally, FTD-codes have also been introduced in the literature of identification problems under the name of strongly identifying codes (or SID-codes for short) and under a differently formulated definition. In this paper, we address the conditions for the existence of FD- and FTD-codes, bounds for their size, their relation to codes of the other types and present some extremal cases for these bounds and relations. We further show that the problems of determining an FD- or an FTD-code of minimum cardinality in a graph are NP-hard. We also show that the cardinalities of minimum FD- and FTD-codes of any graph differ by at most one, but that it is NP-hard to decide whether or not they are equal for a given graph in general.</p></details> |  |
| **[Post-Incorporating Code Structural Knowledge into Pretrained Models via ICL for Code Translation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.22776v2)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Code translation migrates codebases across programming languages. Recently, large language models (LLMs) have achieved significant advancements in software mining. However, handling the syntactic structure of source code remains a challenge. Classic syntax-aware methods depend on intricate model architectures and loss functions, rendering their integration into LLM training resource-intensive. This paper employs in-context learning (ICL), which directly integrates task exemplars into the input context, to post-incorporate code structural knowledge into pre-trained LLMs. We revisit exemplar selection in ICL from an information-theoretic perspective, proposing that list-wise selection based on information coverage is more precise and general objective than traditional methods based on combining similarity and diversity. To address the challenges of quantifying information coverage, we introduce a surrogate measure, Coverage of Abstract Syntax Tree (CAST). Furthermore, we formulate the NP-hard CAST maximization for exemplar selection and prove that it is a standard submodular maximization problem. Therefore, we propose a greedy algorithm for CAST submodular maximization, which theoretically guarantees a (1-1/e)-approximate solution in polynomial time complexity. Our method is the first training-free and model-agnostic approach to post-incorporate code structural knowledge into existing LLMs at test time. Experimental results show that our method significantly improves LLMs performance and reveals two meaningful insights: 1) Code structural knowledge can be effectively post-incorporated into pre-trained LLMs during inference, despite being overlooked during training; 2) Scaling up model size or training data does not lead to the emergence of code structural knowledge, underscoring the necessity of explicitly considering code syntactic structure.</p></details> | <details><summary>IEEE ...</summary><p>IEEE Transactions on Software Engineering</p></details> |
| **[AnyBCQ: Hardware Efficient Flexible Binary-Coded Quantization for Multi-Precision LLMs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10467v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The deployment of large language models (LLMs) is increasingly constrained by memory and latency bottlenecks, motivating the need for quantization techniques that flexibly balance accuracy and efficiency. Recent work has introduced multi-precision models, which enable inference at multiple precisions within a single model depending on runtime constraints. To support such flexibility, quantized weights are often stored as bit-planes, where hardware efficiency improves when the compute operates directly at the bit-plane level and activates only the precision required by each request. In this work, we present AnyBCQ, a hardware-friendly multi-precision extension of Binary-Coded Quantization (BCQ) that supports direct bit-plane operations. By representing weights as binary bit-planes with corresponding scale factors, AnyBCQ enables bit-plane-level computation and maps naturally to accelerator-friendly, bit-parallel arithmetic. Our progressive precision expansion mechanism incrementally refines scaling factors while reusing previously assigned binary codes, yielding monotonic improvements in accuracy as additional bits are enabled. We further co-design a specialized kernel that exploits the BCQ structure to support dynamic per-request precision selection with negligible overhead. Experiments on recent LLMs demonstrate that AnyBCQ significantly narrows the accuracy drop in the low-bit regime (e.g. 2-bit), remains competitive at higher precision, and achieves throughput gains of up to 3.0x over half precision and 1.2x over state-of-the-art multi-precision methods. By aligning algorithmic flexibility with hardware efficiency, AnyBCQ provides a practical foundation for multi-precision LLM deployment across diverse service-level objectives.</p></details> |  |
| **[Testing and Enhancing Multi-Agent Systems for Robust Code Generation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10460v1)** | 2025-10-12 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Multi-agent systems (MASs) have emerged as a promising paradigm for automated code generation, demonstrating impressive performance on established benchmarks by decomposing complex coding tasks across specialized agents with different roles. Despite their prosperous development and adoption, their robustness remains pressingly under-explored, raising critical concerns for real-world deployment. This paper presents the first comprehensive study examining the robustness of MASs for code generation through a fuzzing-based testing approach. By designing a fuzzing pipeline incorporating semantic-preserving mutation operators and a novel fitness function, we assess mainstream MASs across multiple datasets and LLMs. Our findings reveal substantial robustness flaws of various popular MASs: they fail to solve 7.9%-83.3% of problems they initially resolved successfully after applying the semantic-preserving mutations. Through comprehensive failure analysis, we identify a common yet largely overlooked cause of the robustness issue: miscommunications between planning and coding agents, where plans lack sufficient detail and coding agents misinterpret intricate logic, aligning with the challenges inherent in a multi-stage information transformation process. Accordingly, we also propose a repairing method that encompasses multi-prompt generation and introduces a new monitor agent to address this issue. Evaluation shows that our repairing method effectively enhances the robustness of MASs by solving 40.0%-88.9% of identified failures. Our work uncovers critical robustness flaws in MASs and provides effective mitigation strategies, contributing essential insights for developing more reliable MASs for code generation.</p></details> | 19pages, 5 figures |

We propose latent-space language steering, a lightweight inference-time method that identifies language directions via PCA on parallel translations and steers token embeddings along these axes to control language identity. Our approach mitigates code-switching while preserving semantics with negligible computational overhead and requires only minimal parallel data for calibration. Empirically, we achieve 95-99\% language classification accuracy using a single principal component and reduce next-token distributional divergence by up to 42% across multiple language pairs on Qwen2.5 and Llama-3.2 models. We further analyze the layer-wise evolution of language representations, revealing that language identity concentrates in final layers with near-perfect linear separability.</p></details> |  |

Evaluated on safety-oriented C/C++ standards, the approach achieves sub-minute median first-feedback (offline p50 build+LLM 59.8s) while maintaining competitive violation reduction and lower violation rates versus larger proprietary models. The architecture is decoupled: teams can adopt the grounding/prompting layer or the serving layer independently. A small internal survey (n=8) provides directional signals of reduced triage effort and moderate perceived grounding, with participants reporting fewer human review iterations.

However, LLM-generated code still suffers from compilation and runtime errors. Existing offline preference optimization methods primarily focus on enhancing LLMs' coding abilities using pass/fail signals in the preference data, overlooking the deep-level error types in the failed codes. To address this, we propose Adaptively Progressive Preference Optimization (AP2O) for coding (i.e., AP2O-Coder), a method that guides LLMs adaptively and methodically to reduce code errors for code generation. Specifically, we construct an error notebook from failed codes and progressively optimize the LLM to correct errors type by type. Furthermore, we adaptively replay error types to tailor to the LLM's changing weaknesses throughout the training process. Through extensive experiments on both code and general LLMs (Llama, Qwen, and DeepSeek series) with parameters ranging from 0.5B to 34B, our AP2O-Coder improves code generation performance by up to 3% in pass@k while using less preference data.

Although traditional methods, such as constrained decoding, alleviate this problem by externally rejecting untypable code, the model itself does not effectively learn type reasoning internally, which ultimately limits its overall performance. This paper introduces TyFlow, a novel system that internalizes type reasoning within code generation to guide the model to learn the type system. The core of our approach is a novel type-guided program synthesis system that maintains an isomorphism between type derivation trees and synthesis derivation trees, enabling a new code representation based on synthesis decision sequences rather than traditional text-based token sequences. By offloading the complexity of type system learning to the representation itself, models can redirect their computational resources toward higher-level program semantics. Our evaluation shows that TyFlow not only eliminates type errors but also significantly improves functional correctness, highlighting the importance of aligning LMs with type systems internally.</p></details> |  |

Model vulnerabilities are exposed using audits and red-teaming efforts. Existing efforts have focused primarily on the English language; thus, models continue to be susceptible to multilingual jailbreaking strategies, especially for multimodal contexts. In this study, we introduce a novel strategy that leverages code-mixing and phonetic perturbations to jailbreak LLMs for both text and image generation tasks. We also present an extension to a current jailbreak-template-based strategy and propose a novel template, showing higher effectiveness than baselines. Our work presents a method to effectively bypass safety filters in LLMs while maintaining interpretability by applying phonetic misspellings to sensitive words in code-mixed prompts. We achieve a 99\% Attack Success Rate for text generation and 78\% for image generation, with Attack Relevance Rate of 100\% for text generation and 96\% for image generation for the phonetically perturbed code-mixed prompts. Our interpretability experiments reveal that phonetic perturbations impact word tokenization, leading to jailbreak success. Our study motivates increasing the focus towards more generalizable safety alignment for multilingual multimodal models, especially in real-world settings wherein prompts can have misspelt words. \textit{\textbf{Warning: This paper contains examples of potentially harmful and offensive content.}}</p></details> |  |

We introduce CodeCrash, a stress-testing framework with 1,279 questions from CruxEval and LiveCodeBench, designed to evaluate reasoning reliability under structural perturbations and misleading natural language (NL) contexts. Through a systematic evaluation of 17 LLMs, we find that models often shortcut reasoning by over-relying on NL cues, leading to an average performance degradation of 23.2% in output prediction tasks. Even with Chain-of-Thought reasoning, models on average still have a 13.8% drop due to distractibility and rationalization, revealing a lack of critical reasoning capability to distinguish the actual code behaviors. While Large Reasoning Models with internal reasoning mechanisms improve robustness by fostering critical thinking, plausible yet incorrect hints can trigger pathological self-reflection, causing 2-3 times token consumption and even catastrophic cognitive dissonance in extreme cases for QwQ-32B. We refer to this phenomenon as Reasoning Collapse. CodeCrash provides a rigorous benchmark for evaluating robustness in code reasoning, guiding future research and development toward more reliable and resilient models.</p></details> | <details><summary>NeurI...</summary><p>NeurIPS 2025; 10 pages of main text; 25 pages of appendices.

Many mainstream libraries implement a large number of vectorized algorithms on Arm or x86 SIMD intrinsic functions. With the rapid expansion of the RISC-V hardware-software ecosystem, there is a growing demand for support of the RISC-V Vector (RVV) extension. Translating existing vectorized intrinsic code onto RVV intrinsics is a practical and effective approach. However, current cross-architecture translation largely relies on manual rewriting, which is time-consuming and error-prone. Furthermore, while some rule-based methods can reduce the need for manual intervention, their translation success rate is limited by incomplete rule coverage and syntactic constraints, and the performance suffers from inadequate utilization of RVV-specific features. We present IntrinTrans, a LLM-based multi-agent approach that utilizes compile-and-test feedback to translate intrinsic code across architectures automatically, and further optimizes the generated RVV intrinsics using register-usage information derived from liveness analysis. To evaluate the effectiveness of our approach, we collected 34 vectorized algorithm cases from open-source libraries. Each case includes an Arm Neon intrinsics implementation and a RVV intrinsics implementation contributed by the open-source community, together with correctness and performance tests. Our experiments show that advanced LLMs produce semantically correct RISC-V Vector intrinsics in most cases within a limited number of iterations, and in some cases achieve up to 5.93x the performance of the native implementation from the open-source community.</p></details> | 9 pages |

| **[Optimization Modulo Integer Linear-Exponential Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14550v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>This paper presents the first study of the complexity of the optimization problem for integer linear-exponential programs which extend classical integer linear programs with the exponential function $x \mapsto 2^x$ and the remainder function ${(x,y) \mapsto (x \bmod 2^y)}$. The problem of deciding if such a program has a solution was recently shown to be NP-complete in [Chistikov et al., ICALP'24]. The optimization problem instead asks for a solution that maximizes (or minimizes) a linear-exponential objective function, subject to the constraints of an integer linear-exponential program. We establish the following results: 1. If an optimal solution exists, then one of them can be succinctly represented as an integer linear-exponential straight-line program (ILESLP): an arithmetic circuit whose gates always output an integer value (by construction) and implement the operations of addition, exponentiation, and multiplication by rational numbers. 2. There is an algorithm that runs in polynomial time, given access to an integer factoring oracle, which determines whether an ILESLP encodes a solution to an integer linear-exponential program. This algorithm can also be used to compare the values taken by the objective function on two given solutions. Building on these results, we place the optimization problem for integer linear-exponential programs within an extension of the optimization class $\text{NPO}$ that lies within $\text{FNP}^{\text{NP}}$. In essence, this extension forgoes determining the optimal solution via binary search.</p></details> | <details><summary>Exten...</summary><p>Extended version of a SODA 2026 paper</p></details> |

While AI-based systems offer scalable and immediate help, their responses can occasionally be inaccurate or insufficient. Human instructors, in contrast, may bring more valuable expertise but are limited in time and availability. To address these limitations, we present a hybrid help framework that integrates AI-generated hints with an escalation mechanism, allowing students to request feedback from instructors when AI support falls short. This design leverages the strengths of AI for scale and responsiveness while reserving instructor effort for moments of greatest need. We deployed this tool in a data science programming course with 82 students. We observe that out of the total 673 AI-generated hints, students rated 146 (22%) as unhelpful. Among those, only 16 (11%) of the cases were escalated to the instructors. A qualitative investigation of instructor responses showed that those feedback instances were incorrect or insufficient roughly half of the time. This finding suggests that when AI support fails, even instructors with expertise may need to pay greater attention to avoid making mistakes. We will publicly release the tool for broader adoption and enable further studies in other classrooms. Our work contributes a practical approach to scaling high-quality support and informs future efforts to effectively integrate AI and humans in education.</p></details> | <details><summary>Prepr...</summary><p>Preprint of the SIGCSE'26 paper</p></details> |

This article outlines the foundation of an automated translation tool for NWS products, powered by artificial intelligence. The NWS has partnered with LILT, whose patented training process enables large language models (LLMs) to adapt neural machine translation (NMT) tools for weather terminology and messaging. Designed for scalability across Weather Forecast Offices (WFOs) and National Centers, the system is currently being developed in Spanish, Simplified Chinese, Vietnamese, and other widely spoken non-English languages. Rooted in best practices for multilingual risk communication, the system provides accurate, timely, and culturally relevant translations, significantly reducing manual translation time and easing operational workloads across the NWS. To guide the distribution of these products, GIS mapping was used to identify language needs across different NWS regions, helping prioritize resources for the communities that need them most. We also integrated ethical AI practices throughout the program's design, ensuring that transparency, fairness, and human oversight guide how automated translations are created, evaluated, and shared with the public. This work has culminated into a website featuring experimental multilingual NWS products, including translated warnings, 7-day forecasts, and educational campaigns, bringing the country one step closer to a national warning system that reaches all Americans.</p></details> |  |
| **[PathFix: Automated Program Repair with Expected Path](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14341v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Automated program repair (APR) techniques are effective in fixing inevitable defects in software, enhancing development efficiency and software robustness. However, due to the difficulty of generating precise specifications, existing APR methods face two main challenges: generating too many plausible patch candidates and overfitting them to partial test cases. To tackle these challenges, we introduce a new APR method named PathFix, which leverages path-sensitive constraints extracted from correct execution paths to generate patches for repairing buggy code. It is based on one observation: if a buggy program is repairable, at least one expected path is supposed to replace the fault path in the patched program. PathFix operates in four main steps. First, it traces fault paths reaching the fault output in the buggy program. Second, it derives expected paths by analyzing the desired correct output on the control flow graph, where an expected path defines how a feasible patch leads to the correct execution. Third, PathFix generates and evaluates patches by solving state constraints along the expected path. Fourth, we validate the correctness of the generated patch. To further enhance repair performance and mitigate scalability issues introduced by path-sensitive analysis, we integrate a large language model (LLM) into our framework. Experimental results show that PathFix outperforms existing solutions, particularly in handling complex program structures such as loops and recursion.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is the author's version of a paper accepted at SecDev 2025 (IEEE)</p></details> |
| **[A Systematic Study of Time Limit Exceeded Errors in Online Programming Assignments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14339v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Online programming platforms such as Codeforces and LeetCode attract millions of users seeking to learn to program or refine their skills for industry interviews. A major challenge for these users is the Time Limit Exceeded (TLE) error, triggered when a program exceeds the execution time bound. Although designed as a performance safeguard, TLE errors are difficult to resolve: error messages provide no diagnostic insight, platform support is minimal, and existing debugging tools offer little help. As a result, many users abandon their submissions after repeated TLE failures. This paper presents the first large-scale empirical study of TLE errors in online programming. We manually analyzed 1000 Codeforces submissions with TLE errors, classified their root causes, and traced how users attempted to fix them. Our analysis shows that TLE errors often arise not only from inefficient algorithms but also from infinite loops, improper data structure use, and inefficient I/O, challenging the conventional view that TLEs are purely performance issues. Guided by these findings, we introduce Nettle, the first automated repair tool specifically designed for TLE errors, and Nettle-Eval, the first framework for evaluating TLE repairs. Integrating LLMs with targeted automated feedback generated by the compiler and test cases, Nettle produces small, correct code edits that eliminate TLEs while preserving functionality. Evaluated on the same 1000 real-world cases, Nettle achieves a 98.5% fix rate, far exceeding the strongest LLM baseline, and all of its repairs pass both Nettle-Eval and the platform's official checker, confirming the reliability of our framework.</p></details> |  |
| **[LLM-ERM: Sample-Efficient Program Learning via LLM-Guided Search](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14331v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We seek algorithms for program learning that are both sample-efficient and computationally feasible. Classical results show that targets admitting short program descriptions (e.g., with short ``python code'') can be learned with a ``small'' number of examples (scaling with the size of the code) via length-first program enumeration, but the search is exponential in description length. Consequently, Gradient-based training avoids this cost yet can require exponentially many samples on certain short-program families. To address this gap, we introduce LLM-ERM, a propose-and-verify framework that replaces exhaustive enumeration with an LLM-guided search over candidate programs while retaining ERM-style selection on held-out data. Specifically, we draw $k$ candidates with a pretrained reasoning-augmented LLM, compile and check each on the data, and return the best verified hypothesis, with no feedback, adaptivity, or gradients. Theoretically, we show that coordinate-wise online mini-batch SGD requires many samples to learn certain short programs. {\em Empirically, LLM-ERM solves tasks such as parity variants, pattern matching, and primality testing with as few as 200 samples, while SGD-trained transformers overfit even with 100,000 samples}. These results indicate that language-guided program synthesis recovers much of the statistical efficiency of finite-class ERM while remaining computationally tractable, offering a practical route to learning succinct hypotheses beyond the reach of gradient-based training.</p></details> |  |
| **[Column Generation Using Domain-Independent Dynamic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.14317v1)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Column generation and branch-and-price are leading methods for large-scale exact optimization. Column generation iterates between solving a master problem and a pricing problem. The master problem is a linear program, which can be solved using a generic solver. The pricing problem is highly dependent on the application but is usually discrete. Due to the difficulty of discrete optimization, high-performance column generation often relies on a custom pricing algorithm built specifically to exploit the problem's structure. This bespoke nature of the pricing solver prevents the reuse of components for other applications. We show that domain-independent dynamic programming, a software package for modeling and solving arbitrary dynamic programs, can be used as a generic pricing solver. We develop basic implementations of branch-and-price with pricing by domain-independent dynamic programming and show that they outperform a world-leading solver on static mixed integer programming formulations for seven problem classes.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to INFORMS Journal on Computing didp-rs code: https://github.com/domain-independent-dp/didp-rs/releases/tag/labeling Model code: https://github.com/Kurorororo/didp-column-generation</p></details> |
| **[Domain-Independent Dynamic Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2401.13883v4)** | 2025-10-16 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>For combinatorial optimization problems, model-based paradigms such as mixed-integer programming (MIP) and constraint programming (CP) aim to decouple modeling and solving a problem: the `holy grail' of declarative problem solving. We propose domain-independent dynamic programming (DIDP), a novel model-based paradigm based on dynamic programming (DP). While DP is not new, it has typically been implemented as a problem-specific method. We introduce Dynamic Programming Description Language (DyPDL), a formalism to define DP models based on a state transition system, inspired by artificial intelligence (AI) planning. we show that heuristic search algorithms can be used to solve DyPDL models and propose seven DIDP solvers. We experimentally compare our DIDP solvers with commercial MIP and CP solvers (solving MIP and CP models, respectively) on common benchmark instances of eleven combinatorial optimization problem classes. We show that DIDP outperforms MIP in nine problem classes, CP also in nine problem classes, and both MIP and CP in seven. DIDP also achieves superior performance to existing state-based solvers including domain-independent AI planners.</p></details> | <details><summary>Manus...</summary><p>Manuscript submitted to Artificial Intelligence</p></details> |

With DNNs characterized by a prolonged sequence of nonlinear propagation, determining their optimal parameters given an objective naturally fits within the framework of Optimal Control Programming. Such an interpretation of DNNs as dynamical systems has proven crucial in offering a theoretical foundation for principled analysis from numerical equations to physics. In parallel to these theoretical pursuits, this paper focuses on an algorithmic perspective. Our motivated observation is the striking algorithmic resemblance between the Backpropagation algorithm for computing gradients in DNNs and the optimality conditions for dynamical systems, expressed through another backward process known as dynamic programming. Consolidating this connection, where Backpropagation admits a variational structure, solving an approximate dynamic programming up to the first-order expansion leads to a new class of optimization methods exploring higher-order expansions of the Bellman equation. The resulting optimizer, termed Optimal Control Theoretic Neural Optimizer (OCNOpt), enables rich algorithmic opportunities, including layer-wise feedback policies, game-theoretic applications, and higher-order training of continuous-time models such as Neural ODEs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that OCNOpt improves upon existing methods in robustness and efficiency while maintaining manageable computational complexity, paving new avenues for principled algorithmic design grounded in dynamical systems and optimal control theory.</p></details> |  |

In our paper we investigate the emerging Vibe Coding (VC) paradigm that emphasizes intuitive, affect-driven, and improvisational interactions between developers and AI systems. Building upon the discourse of End-User Development (EUD), we explore how VC diverges from conventional programming approaches such as those supported by tools like GitHub Copilot. Through five semi-structured interview sessions with ten experienced software practitioners, we identify five thematic dimensions: creativity, sustainability, the future of programming, collaboration, and criticism. Our analysis conceptualizes VC within the metaphor of co-drifting, contrasting it with the prevalent co-piloting perspective of AI-assisted development. We argue that VC reconfigures the developers role, blurring boundaries between professional and non-developers. While VC enables novel forms of expression and rapid prototyping, it also introduces challenges regarding reproducibility, scalability, and inclusivity. We propose that VC represents a meaningful shift in programming culture, warranting further investigation within human-computer interaction (HCI) and software engineering research.</p></details> | <details><summary>Works...</summary><p>Workshop Contribution at the sixth decennial Aarhus conference in "The End of Programming (as we know it) - Envisioning Radical Re-Conceptualizations of Co-Coding with AI"</p></details> |

We explore to what extent this latent correction capability extends to Automated Program Repair (APR) by investigating Round-Trip Translation (RTT): translating code from one programming language into another programming or natural language and back, using Large Language Models (LLMs). We hypothesize that RTT restores patterns most commonly seen in the LLM's training corpora through regression toward the mean, replacing infrequent bugs with more frequent, natural, bug-free code. To test this hypothesis, we employ nine LLMs and four common APR benchmarks in Java, and perform a detailed quantitative and qualitative analysis of RTT-generated patches. We find that RTT through English generates plausible patches for 100 of 164 bugs with GPT-4 on the HumanEval-Java benchmark, and 97 are found to be correct in our manual assessment. Moreover, RTT uniquely generates plausible patches for 46 bugs that were missed by LLMs specifically fine-tuned for APR. While this demonstrates the viability of RTT for APR, we also observe limitations, such as a lower overall bug fix rate than the state-of-the-art and diluting the original coding style. We analyze the impact of these limitations and discuss the potential of using RTT as a complementary component in APR frameworks.

Now, this is not a technical detailing of these components, rather, I attempt to provide an overview as I myself have lacked during my time investigating programming languages. Thus, read this as an introduction to the magical world of extensibility. Through a literature review, I identify key extensibility themes - Macros, Modules, Types, and Reflection - highlighting diverse strategies for fostering extensibility. The analysis extends to cross-theme properties such as Parametricism and First-class citizen behaviour, introducing layers of complexity by highlighting the importance of customizability and flexibility in programming language constructs. By outlining these facets of existing programming languages and research, I aim to inspire future language designers to assess and consider the extensibility of their creations critically.</p></details> |  |
| **[Behavioral Embeddings of Programs: A Quasi-Dynamic Approach for Optimization Prediction](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.13158v1)** | 2025-10-15 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Learning effective numerical representations, or embeddings, of programs is a fundamental prerequisite for applying machine learning to automate and enhance compiler optimization. Prevailing paradigms, however, present a dilemma. Static representations, derived from source code or intermediate representation (IR), are efficient and deterministic but offer limited insight into how a program will behave or evolve under complex code transformations. Conversely, dynamic representations, which rely on runtime profiling, provide profound insights into performance bottlenecks but are often impractical for large-scale tasks due to prohibitive overhead and inherent non-determinism. This paper transcends this trade-off by proposing a novel quasi-dynamic framework for program representation. The core insight is to model a program's optimization sensitivity. We introduce the Program Behavior Spectrum, a new representation generated by probing a program's IR with a diverse set of optimization sequences and quantifying the resulting changes in its static features. To effectively encode this high-dimensional, continuous spectrum, we pioneer a compositional learning approach. Product Quantization is employed to discretize the continuous reaction vectors into structured, compositional sub-words. Subsequently, a multi-task Transformer model, termed PQ-BERT, is pre-trained to learn the deep contextual grammar of these behavioral codes. Comprehensive experiments on two representative compiler optimization tasks -- Best Pass Prediction and -Oz Benefit Prediction -- demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art static baselines. Our code is publicly available at https://github.com/Panhaolin2001/PREP/.</p></details> |  |

Techniques like chain-of-thought prompting, tree-of-thought prompting, and program-of-thought prompting guide LLMs through intermediate reasoning steps. Although in-context learning with few-shot prompting has improved performance, LLMs still lag behind state-of-the-art models on financial numerical reasoning datasets such as FinQA and ConvFinQA. In this work, we introduce FINDER, a novel two-step framework, to enhance LLMs' capabilities in financial numerical reasoning. The first step utilizes a generative retriever to extract relevant facts from unstructured data, including both text and tables. This is followed by context-aware Program of Thought prompting with dynamic selection of in-context examples.

In common eye-tracking studies in program comprehension, researchers must preselect analysis targets such as control flow or syntactic elements, and then develop analysis methods to extract appropriate metrics from the fixation for source code. Here, researchers can define various levels of AOIs like words, lines, or code blocks, and the difference leads to different results. Moreover, the interpretation of fixation for word/line can vary across the purposes of the analyses. Hence, the eye-tracking analysis is a difficult task that depends on the time-consuming manual work of the researchers. eye2vec represents continuous two fixations as transitions between syntactic elements using distributed representations.

This paper provides the first average-case analysis of exact regularization: with a standard Gaussian cost vector and fixed constraint set, bounds are established for the probability that exact regularization succeeds as a function of regularization strength. Failure is characterized via the Gaussian measure of inner cones, controlled by novel two-sided bounds on the measure of shifted cones. Results reveal dimension-dependent scaling laws and connect exact regularization of linear programs to their polyhedral geometry via the normal fan and the Gaussian (solid-angle) measure of its cones. Computable bounds are obtained in several canonical settings, including regularized optimal transport. Numerical experiments corroborate the predicted scalings and thresholds.</p></details> | 25 pages, 4 figures |

Most existing model reduction methods are based on variable reduction, which predicts a solution value for a subset of variables. From a dual perspective, constraint reduction that transforms a subset of inequality constraints into equalities can also reduce the complexity of MILP, but has been largely ignored. Therefore, this paper proposes a novel constraint-based model reduction approach for the MILP. Constraint-based MILP reduction has two challenges: 1) which inequality constraints are critical such that reducing them can accelerate MILP solving while preserving feasibility, and 2) how to predict these critical constraints efficiently. To identify critical constraints, we first label these tight-constraints at the optimal solution as potential critical constraints and design a heuristic rule to select a subset of critical tight-constraints. To learn the critical tight-constraints, we propose a multi-modal representation technique that leverages information from both instance-level and abstract-level MILP formulations. The experimental results show that, compared to the state-of-the-art methods, our method improves the quality of the solution by over 50\% and reduces the computation time by 17.47\%.</p></details> | <details><summary>Since...</summary><p>Since the article needs improvement, it will be temporarily withdrawn</p></details> |
| **[CoLF Logic Programming as Infinitary Proof Exploration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12302v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Logical Frameworks such as Automath [de Bruijn, 1968] or LF [Harper et al., 1993] were originally conceived as metalanguages for the specification of foundationally uncommitted deductive systems, yielding generic proof checkers. Their high level of abstraction was soon exploited to also express algorithms over deductive systems such as theorem provers, type-checkers, evaluators, compilers, proof transformers, etc. in the paradigm of computation-as-proof-construction. This has been realized in languages such as $\lambda$-Prolog [Miller et al., 1991] or Elf [Pfenning, 1991] based on backward chaining, and LolliMon [Lopez et al., 2005] or Celf [Schack-Nielsen and Schuermann, 2008], which integrated forward chaining. None of these early frameworks supported the direct expression of infinitary objects or proofs, which are available in the recently developed CoLF$^\omega$ [Chen, 2023]. In this work-in-progress report, we sketch an approach to computation-as-proof-construction over the first-order fragment of CoLF$^\omega$ (called CoLF$^\omega_1$ ) that already includes infinitary objects and proofs. A key idea is the interpretation of logic variables as communication channels and computation as concurrent message-passing. This is realized in a concrete compiler from CoLF$^\omega_1$ to Sax, a proof-theoretically inspired parallel programming language based on the proof-reduction in the semi-axiomatic sequent calculus [DeYoung et al., 2020].</p></details> | <details><summary>In Pr...</summary><p>In Proceedings LFMTP 2025, arXiv:2510.11199</p></details> |
| **[A Gradient Guided Diffusion Framework for Chance Constrained Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.12238v1)** | 2025-10-14 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Chance constrained programming (CCP) is a powerful framework for addressing optimization problems under uncertainty. In this paper, we introduce a novel Gradient-Guided Diffusion-based Optimization framework, termed GGDOpt, which tackles CCP through three key innovations. First, GGDOpt accommodates a broad class of CCP problems without requiring the knowledge of the exact distribution of uncertainty-relying solely on a set of samples. Second, to address the nonconvexity of the chance constraints, it reformulates the CCP as a sampling problem over the product of two distributions: an unknown data distribution supported on a nonconvex set and a Boltzmann distribution defined by the objective function, which fully leverages both first- and second-order gradient information. Third, GGDOpt has theoretical convergence guarantees and provides practical error bounds under mild assumptions. By progressively injecting noise during the forward diffusion process to convexify the nonconvex feasible region, GGDOpt enables guided reverse sampling to generate asymptotically optimal solutions. Experimental results on synthetic datasets and a waveform design task in wireless communications demonstrate that GGDOpt outperforms existing methods in both solution quality and stability with nearly 80% overhead reduction.</p></details> |  |
| **[Automatically Generating Questions About Scratch Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11658v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>When learning to program, students are usually assessed based on the code they wrote. However, the mere completion of a programming task does not guarantee actual comprehension of the underlying concepts. Asking learners questions about the code they wrote has therefore been proposed as a means to assess program comprehension. As creating targeted questions for individual student programs can be tedious and challenging, prior work has proposed to generate such questions automatically. In this paper we generalize this idea to the block-based programming language Scratch. We propose a set of 30 different questions for Scratch code covering an established program comprehension model, and extend the LitterBox static analysis tool to automatically generate corresponding questions for a given Scratch program. On a dataset of 600,913 projects we generated 54,118,694 questions automatically. Our initial experiments with 34 ninth graders demonstrate that this approach can indeed generate meaningful questions for Scratch programs, and we find that the ability of students to answer these questions on their programs relates to their overall performance.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at CompEd 2025</p></details> |
| **[The Matthew Effect of AI Programming Assistants: A Hidden Bias in Software Evolution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.23261v2)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>AI-assisted programming is rapidly reshaping software development, with large language models (LLMs) enabling new paradigms such as vibe coding and agentic coding. While prior works have focused on prompt design and code generation quality, the broader impact of LLM-driven development on the iterative dynamics of software engineering remains underexplored. In this paper, we conduct large-scale experiments on thousands of algorithmic programming tasks and hundreds of framework selection tasks to systematically investigate how AI-assisted programming interacts with the software ecosystem. Our analysis reveals \textbf{a striking Matthew effect: the more popular a programming language or framework, the higher the success rate of LLM-generated code}. The phenomenon suggests that AI systems may reinforce existing popularity hierarchies, accelerating convergence around dominant tools while hindering diversity and innovation. We provide a quantitative characterization of this effect and discuss its implications for the future evolution of programming ecosystems.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Denotational Product Construction for Temporal Verification of Effectful Higher-Order Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11320v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We propose a categorical framework for linear-time temporal verification of effectful higher-order programs, including probabilistic higher-order programs. Our framework provides a generic denotational reduction -- namely, a denotational product construction -- from linear-time safety verification of effectful higher-order programs to computation of weakest pre-conditions of product programs. This reduction enables us to apply existing algorithms for such well-studied computations of weakest pre-conditions, some of which are available as off-the-shelf solvers. We show the correctness of our denotational product construction by proving a preservation theorem under strong monad morphisms and an existence of suitable liftings along a fibration. We instantiate our framework with both probabilistic and angelic nondeterministic higher-order programs, and implement an automated solver for the probabilistic case based on the existing solver developed by Kura and Unno. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first automated verifier for linear-time temporal verification of probabilistic higher-order programs with recursion.</p></details> | Preprint |

A central feature of VeriFast is its support for higher-order ghost code, which enables its support for expressively specifying fine-grained concurrent modules, without the need for the later modality. We present the first formalization and soundness proof for this aspect of VeriFast's logic, and we compare it both to Iris, a state-of-the-art logic for fine-grained concurrency which features the later modality, as well as to some recent proposals for Iris-like reasoning without the later modality.</p></details> | 10 pages, 8 figures |
| **[DebugTA: An LLM-Based Agent for Simplifying Debugging and Teaching in Programming Education](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11076v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In programming education, Debugging and Teaching (DT) task is a common scenario where students receive assistance in correcting their erroneous code. The task involves multiple inputs, including erroneous code, error messages, reference solutions, and the question description, with the goal of generating modification suggestions to the erroneous code. However, two key challenges hinder the effectiveness of existing approaches. Firstly, the complexity and heterogeneity of inputs inherent in DT tasks significantly elevate the reasoning challenges faced by LLMs. Second, existing approaches often fail to fully leverage the availability of standard code in DT tasks, forcing models to rely solely on complex multi-step reasoning, which limits the potential of LLMs in addressing DT tasks effectively. To address these challenges, we propose DebugTA, a novel LLM-based debugging and teaching agent with specialized tools for standard code retrieval, variable substitution to align reference code, and an external compiler for real-time code analysis. Guided by explicit pedagogical and debugging principles, DebugTA acts as an agent that decomposes a complex task into sequential LLM interactions, each utilizing distinct tools for specific subtasks, thereby simplifying the logical reasoning at each step and reducing overall reasoning complexity. Furthermore, DebugTA utilizes tool calls to align the standard code with the erroneous code as much as possible, allowing the LLM to focus on logic errors within the erroneous code and improving the accuracy of the generated suggestions. To rigorously assess the quality of modification suggestions, we introduce a student simulator-teacher interaction paradigm. Experimental results on three real-world code datasets demonstrate that DebugTA consistently improves teaching effectiveness while significantly reducing computational costs.</p></details> |  |
| **[Detecting Gender Stereotypes in Scratch Programming Tutorials](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.11064v1)** | 2025-10-13 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Gender stereotypes in introductory programming courses often go unnoticed, yet they can negatively influence young learners' interest and learning, particularly under-represented groups such as girls. Popular tutorials on block-based programming with Scratch may unintentionally reinforce biases through character choices, narrative framing, or activity types. Educators currently lack support in identifying and addressing such bias. With large language models~(LLMs) increasingly used to generate teaching materials, this problem is potentially exacerbated by LLMs trained on biased datasets. However, LLMs also offer an opportunity to address this issue. In this paper, we explore the use of LLMs for automatically identifying gender-stereotypical elements in Scratch tutorials, thus offering feedback on how to improve teaching content. We develop a framework for assessing gender bias considering characters, content, instructions, and programming concepts. Analogous to how code analysis tools provide feedback on code in terms of code smells, we operationalise this framework using an automated tool chain that identifies *gender stereotype smells*. Evaluation on 73 popular Scratch tutorials from leading educational platforms demonstrates that stereotype smells are common in practice. LLMs are not effective at detecting them, but our gender bias evaluation framework can guide LLMs in generating tutorials with fewer stereotype smells.</p></details> | Koli Calling 2025 |

Generating realistic scenes with varied object poses remains an open and challenging task. In this work, we propose FactoredScenes, a framework that synthesizes realistic 3D scenes by leveraging the underlying structure of rooms while learning the variation of object poses from lived-in scenes. We introduce a factored representation that decomposes scenes into hierarchically organized concepts of room programs and object poses. To encode structure, FactoredScenes learns a library of functions capturing reusable layout patterns from which scenes are drawn, then uses large language models to generate high-level programs, regularized by the learned library. To represent scene variations, FactoredScenes learns a program-conditioned model to hierarchically predict object poses, and retrieves and places 3D objects in a scene. We show that FactoredScenes generates realistic, real-world rooms that are difficult to distinguish from real ScanNet scenes.</p></details> | NeurIPS 2025 |
| **[Learning to Guarantee Type Correctness in Code Generation through Type-Guided Program Synthesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10216v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Language models have shown remarkable proficiency in code generation; nevertheless, ensuring type correctness remains a challenge. Although traditional methods, such as constrained decoding, alleviate this problem by externally rejecting untypable code, the model itself does not effectively learn type reasoning internally, which ultimately limits its overall performance. This paper introduces TyFlow, a novel system that internalizes type reasoning within code generation to guide the model to learn the type system. The core of our approach is a novel type-guided program synthesis system that maintains an isomorphism between type derivation trees and synthesis derivation trees, enabling a new code representation based on synthesis decision sequences rather than traditional text-based token sequences. By offloading the complexity of type system learning to the representation itself, models can redirect their computational resources toward higher-level program semantics. Our evaluation shows that TyFlow not only eliminates type errors but also significantly improves functional correctness, highlighting the importance of aligning LMs with type systems internally.</p></details> |  |
| **[End-to-end Compositional Verification of Program Safety through Verified and Verifying Compilation](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.10015v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program safety (i.e., absence of undefined behaviors) is critical for correct operation of computer systems. It is usually verified at the source level (e.g., by separation logics) and preserved to the target by verified compilers (e.g., CompCert), thereby achieving end-to-end verification of safety. However, modern safe programming languages like Rust pose new problems in achieving end-to-end safety. Because not all functionalities can be implemented in the safe language, mixing safe and unsafe modules is needed. Therefore, verified compilation must preserve a modular notion of safety which can be composed at the target level. Furthermore, certain classes of errors (e.g., memory errors) are automatically excluded by verifying compilation (e.g., borrow checking) for modules written in safe languages. As a result, verified compilation needs to cooperate with verifying compilation to ensure end-to-end safety. To address the above problems, we propose a modular and generic definition of safety called open safety based on program semantics described as open labeled transition systems (LTS). Open safety is composable at the boundary of modules and can be modularly preserved by verified compositional compilation. Those properties enable separate verification of safety for heterogeneous modules and composition of the safety results at the target level. Open safety can be generalized to partial safety (i.e., only a certain class of errors can occur). By this we formalized the correctness of verifying compilation as derivation of total safety from partial safety. We demonstrate how our framework can combine verified and verifying compilation by developing a verified compiler for an ownership language (called Owlang) inspired by Rust. We evaluate our approach on the compositional safety verification using a hash map implemented by Owlang and C.</p></details> |  |
| **[Remote Interference Mitigation through Null Precoding and Fractional Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09989v1)** | 2025-10-11 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>With the rapid deployment of 5G systems, remote interference (RI) caused by atmospheric ducting has emerged as an occasional, but critical challenge. This phenomenon occurs when the downlink (DL) signals from distant base stations (BSs) propagate over long distances through tropospheric ducting, severely disrupting uplink (UL) reception at local BSs. To address this challenge, we analyze the effect of RI on network performance, including the channel estimation phase. We then develop a solution that identifies the angle-of-arrival (AOA) estimation of RI and designs precoders and combiners that mitigate RI. Our approach employs interference cancellation techniques through null precoding and fractional programming which enhance the performance of the network. Interestingly, we show that using our scheme, uplink communication is possible at low transmit power regimes that were unusable due to RI. Our results further show a 5.23~dB reduction in normalized mean square error for channel estimation and achieved data rates around 5.8~bit/s/Hz at the previously unusable low uplink transmit power conditions.</p></details> |  |

Examples from statistics and probability theory demonstrate how dependent type theory and an algebraic perspective can unify the theoretical and computational concerns of statistics, ensuring rigorous, machine-checked proofs and executable software.</p></details> |  |

The lack of knowledge of English poses a major hurdle to many newcomers who do not have the resources, in terms of time and money, to learn the English language. Studies show that people learn better in their own language. Therefore, we propose a language transpiler built on top of the Python programming language, called UniversalPython, which allows one to write Python in their own human language. We demonstrate the ability to create an "Urdu Python" with this transpiler. In the future, we aim to scale the language to encapsulate more human languages to increase the availability of programming.

| **[Enabling Population-Level Parallelism in Tree-Based Genetic Programming for GPU Acceleration](http://arxiv.org/abs/2501.17168v5)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Tree-based Genetic Programming (TGP) is a widely used evolutionary algorithm for tasks such as symbolic regression, classification, and robotic control. Due to the intensive computational demands of running TGP, GPU acceleration is crucial for achieving scalable performance. However, efficient GPU-based execution of TGP remains challenging, primarily due to three core issues: (1) the structural heterogeneity of program individuals, (2) the complexity of integrating multiple levels of parallelism, and (3) the incompatibility between high-performance CUDA execution and flexible Python-based environments. To address these issues, we propose EvoGP, a high-performance framework tailored for GPU acceleration of TGP via population-level parallel execution. First, EvoGP introduces a tensorized representation that encodes variable-sized trees into fixed-shape, memory-aligned arrays, enabling uniform memory access and parallel computation across diverse individuals. Second, EvoGP adopts an adaptive parallelism strategy that dynamically combines intra- and inter-individual parallelism based on dataset size, ensuring high GPU utilization across a broad spectrum of tasks. Third, EvoGP embeds custom CUDA kernels into the PyTorch runtime, achieving seamless integration with Python-based environments such as Gym, MuJoCo, Brax, and Genesis. Experiments show that EvoGP attains a peak throughput exceeding $10^{11}$ GPops/s, with speedups of up to $528\times$ over GPU-based TGP implementations and $18\times$ over the fastest CPU-based libraries, while maintaining comparable accuracy and improved scalability across large population sizes. EvoGP is open source and accessible at: https://github.com/EMI-Group/evogp.</p></details> |  |
| **[Sequence Variables: A Constraint Programming Computational Domain for Routing and Sequencing](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09373v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constraint Programming (CP) offers an intuitive, declarative framework for modeling Vehicle Routing Problems (VRP), yet classical CP models based on successor variables cannot always deal with optional visits or insertion based heuristics. To address these limitations, this paper formalizes sequence variables within CP. Unlike the classical successor models, this computational domain handle optional visits and support insertion heuristics, including insertion-based Large Neighborhood Search. We provide a clear definition of their domain, update operations, and introduce consistency levels for constraints on this domain. An implementation is described with the underlying data structures required for integrating sequence variables into existing trail-based CP solvers. Furthermore, global constraints specifically designed for sequence variables and vehicle routing are introduced. Finally, the effectiveness of sequence variables is demonstrated by simplifying problem modeling and achieving competitive computational performance on the Dial-a-Ride Problem.</p></details> |  |
| **[Herb.jl: A Unifying Program Synthesis Library](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09726v1)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program synthesis -- the automatic generation of code given a specification -- is one of the most fundamental tasks in artificial intelligence (AI) and many programmers' dream. Numerous synthesizers have been developed to tackle program synthesis, manifesting different ideas to approach the exponentially growing program space. While numerous smart program synthesis tools exist, reusing and remixing previously developed methods is tedious and time-consuming. We propose Herb.jl, a unifying program synthesis library written in the Julia programming language, to address these issues. Since current methods rely on similar building blocks, we aim to modularize the underlying synthesis algorithm into communicating and fully extendable sub-compartments, allowing for straightforward reapplication of these modules. To demonstrate the benefits of using Herb.jl, we show three common use cases: 1. how to implement a simple problem and grammar, and how to solve it, 2. how to implement a previously developed synthesizer with just a few lines of code, and 3. how to run a synthesizer against a benchmark.</p></details> |  |
| **[Obfuscation of Unitary Quantum Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.11970v2)** | 2025-10-10 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Program obfuscation aims to hide the inner workings of a program while preserving its functionality. In the quantum setting, recent works have obtained obfuscation schemes for specialized classes of quantum circuits. For instance, Bartusek, Brakerski, and Vaikuntanathan (STOC 2024) constructed a quantum state obfuscation scheme, which supports the obfuscation of quantum programs represented as quantum states for pseudo-deterministic quantum programs with classical inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model. In this work, we improve upon existing results by constructing the first quantum state obfuscation scheme for unitary (or approximately unitary) quantum programs supporting quantum inputs and outputs in the classical oracle model. At the core of our obfuscation scheme are two novel ingredients: a functional quantum authentication scheme that allows key holders to learn specific functions of the authenticated quantum state with simulation-based security, and a compiler that represents an arbitrary quantum circuit as a projective linear-plus-measurement quantum program described by a sequence of non-adaptive Clifford gates interleaved with adaptive and compatible measurements.</p></details> |  |

The position of the MP is updated via the API in an automated manner over a set of samples within a shell enclosing the surface of the CFS. For each pose of the manipulator, each pair of legs is investigated for mutual collisions. The CFS is considered safe or validated iff none of the points falling inside the CFS lead to a collision between any pair of legs. This approach can not only validate the safety of a precomputed CFS, but also estimate the same for any spatial parallel manipulator.</p></details> |  |
| **[Adaptive Sparsification for Linear Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08348v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a generic framework for solving linear programs (LPs) with many constraints $(n \gg d)$ via adaptive sparsification. Our approach provides a principled generalization of the techniques of [Assadi '23] from matching problems to general LPs and robustifies [Clarkson's '95] celebrated algorithm for the exact setting. The framework reduces LP solving to a sequence of calls to a ``low-violation oracle'' on small, adaptively sampled subproblems, which we analyze through the lens of the multiplicative weight update method. Our main results demonstrate the versatility of this paradigm. First, we present a quantum version of Clarkson's algorithm that finds an exact solution to an LP using $\tilde{O}(\sqrt{n} d^3)$ row-queries to the constraint matrix. This is achieved by accelerating the classical bottleneck (the search for violated constraints) with a generalization of Grover search, decoupling the quantum component from the classical solver. Second, our framework yields new state-of-the-art algorithms for mixed packing and covering problems when the packing constraints are ``simple''. By retaining all packing constraints while sampling only from the covering constraints, we achieve a significant width reduction, leading to faster solvers in both the classical and quantum query models. Our work provides a modular and powerful approach for accelerating LP solvers.</p></details> |  |
| **[Concept-Based Generic Programming in C++](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.08969v1)** | 2025-10-09 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We present programming techniques to illustrate the facilities and principles of C++ generic programming using concepts. Concepts are C++'s way to express constraints on generic code. As an initial example, we provide a simple type system that eliminates narrowing conversions and provides range checking without unnecessary notational or run-time overheads. Concepts are used throughout to provide user-defined extensions to the type system. The aim is to show their utility and the fundamental ideas behind them, rather than to provide a detailed or complete explanation of C++'s language support for generic programming or the extensive support provided by the standard library. Generic programming is an integral part of C++, rather than an isolated sub-language. In particular, key facilities support general programming as well as generic programming (e.g., uniform notation for types, lambdas, variadic templates, and C++26 static reflection). Finally, we give design rationales and origins for key parts of the concept design, including use patterns, the relationship to Object-Oriented Programming, value arguments, notation, concept type-matching, and definition checking.</p></details> |  |

Problems that PDCS currently supports include linear programs, second-order cone programs, convex quadratic programs, and exponential cone programs. PDCS achieves scalability to large-scale problems by leveraging sparse matrix-vector multiplication as its core computational operation, which is both memory-efficient and well-suited for GPU acceleration. The solver is based on the restarted primal-dual hybrid gradient method but further incorporates several enhancements, including adaptive reflected Halpern restarts, adaptive step-size selection, adaptive weight adjustment, and diagonal rescaling. Additionally, PDCS employs a bijection-based method to compute projections onto rescaled cones. Furthermore, cuPDCS is a GPU implementation of PDCS and it implements customized computational schemes that utilize different levels of GPU architecture to handle cones of different types and sizes. Numerical experiments demonstrate that cuPDCS is generally more efficient than state-of-the-art commercial solvers and other first-order methods on large-scale conic program applications, including Fisher market equilibrium problems, Lasso regression, and multi-period portfolio optimization. Furthermore, cuPDCS also exhibits better scalability, efficiency, and robustness compared to other first-order methods on the conic program benchmark dataset CBLIB. These advantages are more pronounced in large-scale, lower-accuracy settings.</p></details> | 48 pages, 8 figures |

According to the European Union AI Act, most MIS will be classified as high-risk systems, requiring a formal risk management process to ensure compliance with the ethical requirements of trustworthy AI. In this context, we focus on risk reduction optimization problems, which aim to reduce risks with ethical considerations by finding the best balanced assignment of risk assessment values according to their coverage of trustworthy AI ethical requirements. We formalize this problem as a constrained optimization task and investigate three resolution paradigms: Mixed Integer Programming (MIP), Satisfiability (SAT), and Constraint Programming(CP).Our contributions include the mathematical formulation of this optimization problem, its modeling with the Minizinc constraint modeling language, and a comparative experimental study that analyzes the performance, expressiveness, and scalability of each approach to solving. From the identified limits of the methodology, we draw some perspectives of this work regarding the integration of the Minizinc model into a complete trustworthy AI ethical risk management process for MIS.</p></details> |  |

Recently, it was shown how duality theorems for countable probability distributions and finite-dimensional quantum states can be leveraged for building relatively complete relational program logics for probabilistic and quantum programs, respectively. However, complete relational logics for classical-quantum programs, which combine classical and quantum computations and operate over classical as well as quantum variables, have remained out of reach. The main gap is that while prior duality theorems could readily be derived using optimal transport and semidefinite programming methods, respectively, the combined setting falls out of the scope of these methods and requires new ideas. In this paper, we overcome this gap and establish the desired duality theorem for classical-quantum states. Our argument relies critically on a novel dimension-independent analysis of the convex optimization problem underlying the finite-dimensional quantum setting, which, in particular, allows us to take the limit where the classical state space becomes infinite. Using the resulting duality theorem, we establish soundness and completeness of a new relational program logic, called $\mathsf{cqOTL}$, for classical-quantum programs. In addition, we lift prior restrictions on the completeness of two existing program logics: $\mathsf{eRHL}$ for probabilistic programs (Avanzini et al., POPL 2025) and $\mathsf{qOTL}$ for quantum programs (Barthe et al., LICS 2025).</p></details> | <details><summary>63 pa...</summary><p>63 pages, 11 figures, 4 tables</p></details> |
| **[Toward Causal-Visual Programming: Enhancing Agentic Reasoning in Low-Code Environments](http://arxiv.org/abs/2509.25282v2)** | 2025-10-08 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large language model (LLM) agents are increasingly capable of orchestrating complex tasks in low-code environments. However, these agents often exhibit hallucinations and logical inconsistencies because their inherent reasoning mechanisms rely on probabilistic associations rather than genuine causal understanding. This paper introduces a new programming paradigm: Causal-Visual Programming (CVP), designed to address this fundamental issue by explicitly introducing causal structures into the workflow design. CVP allows users to define a simple "world model" for workflow modules through an intuitive low-code interface, effectively creating a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) that explicitly defines the causal relationships between modules. This causal graph acts as a crucial constraint during the agent's reasoning process, anchoring its decisions to a user-defined causal structure and significantly reducing logical errors and hallucinations by preventing reliance on spurious correlations. To validate the effectiveness of CVP, we designed a synthetic experiment that simulates a common real-world problem: a distribution shift between the training and test environments. Our results show that a causally anchored model maintained stable accuracy in the face of this shift, whereas a purely associative baseline model that relied on probabilistic correlations experienced a significant performance drop. The primary contributions of this study are: a formal definition of causal structures for workflow modules; the proposal and implementation of a CVP framework that anchors agent reasoning to a user-defined causal graph; and empirical evidence demonstrating the framework's effectiveness in enhancing agent robustness and reducing errors caused by causal confusion in dynamic environments. CVP offers a viable path toward building more interpretable, reliable, and trustworthy AI agents.</p></details> | 5 pages, 1 table |
| **[Automated Program Repair of Uncompilable Student Code](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.06187v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>A significant portion of student programming submissions in CS1 learning environments are uncompilable, limiting their use in student modeling and downstream knowledge tracing. Traditional modeling pipelines often exclude these cases, discarding observations of student learning. This study investigates automated program repair as a strategy to recover uncompilable code while preserving students' structural intent for use in student modeling. Within this framework, we assess large language models (LLMs) as repair agents, including GPT-5 (OpenAI), Claude 3.5 Haiku (Anthropic), and Gemini 2.5 Flash (Google), under high- and low-context prompting conditions. Repairs were evaluated for compilability, edit distance, and preservation of students' original structure and logic. We find that while all three LLMs are capable of producing compilable repairs, their behavior diverges in how well they preserve students' control flow and code structure, which affects their pedagogical utility. By recovering uncompilable submissions, this work enables richer and more comprehensive analyses of learners' coding processes and development over time.</p></details> |  |
| **[ConstraintLLM: A Neuro-Symbolic Framework for Industrial-Level Constraint Programming](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05774v1)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Constraint programming (CP) is a crucial technology for solving real-world constraint optimization problems (COPs), with the advantages of rich modeling semantics and high solving efficiency. Using large language models (LLMs) to generate formal modeling automatically for COPs is becoming a promising approach, which aims to build trustworthy neuro-symbolic AI with the help of symbolic solvers. However, CP has received less attention compared to works based on operations research (OR) models. We introduce ConstraintLLM, the first LLM specifically designed for CP modeling, which is trained on an open-source LLM with multi-instruction supervised fine-tuning. We propose the Constraint-Aware Retrieval Module (CARM) to increase the in-context learning capabilities, which is integrated in a Tree-of-Thoughts (ToT) framework with guided self-correction mechanism. Moreover, we construct and release IndusCP, the first industrial-level benchmark for CP modeling, which contains 140 challenging tasks from various domains. Our experiments demonstrate that ConstraintLLM achieves state-of-the-art solving accuracy across multiple benchmarks and outperforms the baselines by 2x on the new IndusCP benchmark.

| **[PLSemanticsBench: Large Language Models As Programming Language Interpreters](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03415v2)** | 2025-10-07 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As large language models (LLMs) excel at code reasoning, a natural question arises: can an LLM execute programs (i.e., act as an interpreter) purely based on a programming language's formal semantics? If so, it will enable rapid prototyping of new programming languages and language features. We study this question using the imperative language IMP (a subset of C), formalized via small-step operational semantics (SOS) and rewriting-based operational semantics (K-semantics). We introduce three evaluation sets-Human-Written, LLM-Translated, and Fuzzer- Generated-whose difficulty is controlled by code-complexity metrics spanning the size, control-flow, and data-flow axes. Given a program and its semantics formalized with SOS/K-semantics, models are evaluated on three tasks ranging from coarse to fine: (1) final-state prediction, (2) semantic rule prediction, and (3) execution trace prediction. To distinguish pretraining memorization from semantic competence, we define two nonstandard semantics obtained through systematic mutations of the standard rules. Across strong code/reasoning LLMs, performance drops under nonstandard semantics despite high performance under the standard one. We further find that (i) there are patterns to different model failures, (ii) most reasoning models perform exceptionally well on coarse grained tasks involving reasoning about highly complex programs often containing nested loop depths beyond five, and surprisingly, (iii) providing formal semantics helps on simple programs but often hurts on more complex ones. Overall, the results show a promise that LLMs could serve as programming language interpreters, but points to the lack of their robust semantics understanding. We release the benchmark and the supporting code at https://github.com/EngineeringSoftware/PLSemanticsBench.</p></details> |  |

However, most existing explorations focus on GenAI tools that primarily support text-to-text interaction. With recent developments, GenAI applications have begun supporting multiple modes of communication, known as multimodality. In this work, we explored how undergraduate programming novices choose and work with multimodal GenAI tools, and their criteria for choices. We selected a commercially available multimodal GenAI platform for interaction, as it supports multiple input and output modalities, including text, audio, image upload, and real-time screen-sharing. Through 16 think-aloud sessions that combined participant observation with follow-up semi-structured interviews, we investigated student modality choices for GenAI tools when completing programming problems and the underlying criteria for modality selections. With multimodal communication emerging as the future of AI in education, this work aims to spark continued exploration on understanding student interaction with multimodal GenAI in the context of CS education.</p></details> | <details><summary>7 pag...</summary><p>7 pages, accepted to SIGCSE2026</p></details> |
| **[Modeling Student Learning with 3.8 Million Program Traces](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.05056v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>As programmers write code, they often edit and retry multiple times, creating rich "interaction traces" that reveal how they approach coding tasks and provide clues about their level of skill development. For novice programmers in particular, these traces reflect the diverse reasoning processes they employ to code, such as exploratory behavior to understand how a programming concept works, re-strategizing in response to bugs, and personalizing stylistic choices. In this work, we explore what can be learned from training language models on such reasoning traces: not just about code, but about coders, and particularly students learning to program. We introduce a dataset of over 3.8 million programming reasoning traces from users of Pencil Code, a free online educational platform used by students to learn simple programming concepts. Compared to models trained only on final programs or synthetically-generated traces, we find that models trained on real traces are stronger at modeling diverse student behavior. Through both behavioral and probing analyses, we also find that many properties of code traces, such as goal backtracking or number of comments, can be predicted from learned representations of the students who write them. Building on this result, we show that we can help students recover from mistakes by steering code generation models to identify a sequence of edits that will results in more correct code while remaining close to the original student's style. Together, our results suggest that many properties of code are properties of individual students and that training on edit traces can lead to models that are more steerable, more predictive of student behavior while programming, and better at generating programs in their final states.

The multi-stage aspect captures the different times at which variable renewable generation and electricity prices are observed. This results in large-scale optimization problem instances containing large scenario trees with 34 stages, to which scenario reduction techniques are applied. Case studies with real data are discussed to analyse proposed regulatory frameworks in Europe. The added value of considering stochasticity is also analysed.</p></details> |  |
| **[Speculative Automated Refactoring of Imperative Deep Learning Programs to Graph Execution](http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05424v4)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Efficiency is essential to support ever-growing datasets, especially for Deep Learning (DL) systems. DL frameworks have traditionally embraced deferred execution-style DL code -- supporting symbolic, graph-based Deep Neural Network (DNN) computation. While scalable, such development is error-prone, non-intuitive, and difficult to debug. Consequently, more natural, imperative DL frameworks encouraging eager execution have emerged but at the expense of run-time performance. Though hybrid approaches aim for the "best of both worlds," using them effectively requires subtle considerations. Our key insight is that, while DL programs typically execute sequentially, hybridizing imperative DL code resembles parallelizing sequential code in traditional systems. Inspired by this, we present an automated refactoring approach that assists developers in determining which otherwise eagerly-executed imperative DL functions could be effectively and efficiently executed as graphs. The approach features novel static imperative tensor and side-effect analyses for Python. Due to its inherent dynamism, analyzing Python may be unsound; however, the conservative approach leverages a speculative (keyword-based) analysis for resolving difficult cases that informs developers of any assumptions made. The approach is: (i) implemented as a plug-in to the PyDev Eclipse IDE that integrates the WALA Ariadne analysis framework and (ii) evaluated on nineteen DL projects consisting of 132 KLOC. The results show that 326 of 766 candidate functions (42.56%) were refactorable, and an average relative speedup of 2.16x on performance tests was observed with negligible differences in model accuracy. The results indicate that the approach is useful in optimizing imperative DL code to its full potential.</p></details> |  |

However, it is unclear how well these models perform on tasks that require a combination of these skills. In this paper, we curate a novel program synthesis benchmark based on the real-world tasks in the XLogoOnline visual programming environment. Each task requires a combination of different skills such as spatial planning, basic programming, and logical reasoning. Our evaluation shows that current state-of-the-art models like GPT-4V and Llama3-70B struggle to solve these tasks, achieving only 20% and 2.35% success rates, respectively. Next, we develop a fine-tuning pipeline to boost the performance of models by leveraging a large-scale synthetic training dataset with over 80,000 tasks. Moreover, we showcase how emulator-driven feedback can be used to design a curriculum over training data distribution, through which a fine-tuned Llama3-8B drastically outperforms GPT-4V and Llama3-70B models. Finally, we provide an in-depth failure analysis to understand the limitations of different models. We will publicly release the benchmark for future research on program synthesis in visual programming.</p></details> | ACL'25 paper |
| **[Optimization under uncertainty: understanding orders and testing programs with specifications](http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.18561v2)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>One of the most ubiquitous problems in optimization is that of finding all the elements of a finite set at which a function $f$ attains its minimum (or maximum). When the codomain of $f$ is equipped with a total order, it is easy to specify, implement, and verify generic solutions to this problem. But what if $f$ is affected by uncertainties? What if one seeks values that minimize more than one objective, or if $f$ does not return a single result but a set of possible results, or even a probability distribution? Such situations are common in climate science, economics, and engineering. Developing trustworthy solution methods for optimization under uncertainty requires formulating and answering these questions rigorously, including deciding which order relations to apply in different cases. We show how functional programming can support this task, and apply it to specify and test solution methods for cases where optimization is affected by two conceptually different kinds of uncertainty: value and functorial uncertainty.</p></details> |  |
| **[Inverse Mixed-Integer Programming: Learning Constraints then Objective Functions](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04455v1)** | 2025-10-06 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In mixed-integer linear programming, data-driven inverse optimization that learns the objective function and the constraints from observed data plays an important role in constructing appropriate mathematical models for various fields, including power systems and scheduling. However, to the best of our knowledge, there is no known method for learning both the objective functions and the constraints. In this paper, we propose a two-stage method for a class of problems where the objective function is expressed as a linear combination of functions and the constraints are represented by functions and thresholds. Specifically, our method first learns the constraints and then learns the objective function. On the theoretical side, we show the proposed method can solve inverse optimization problems in finite dataset, develop statistical learning theory in pseudometric spaces and sub-Gaussian distributions, and construct a statistical learning for inverse optimization. On the experimental side, we demonstrate that our method is practically applicable for scheduling problems formulated as integer linear programmings with up to 100 decision variables, which are typical in real-world settings.</p></details> | 33 pages |

Influence branching, a new graph-oriented variable selection strategy, is applied throughout the first iterations of the branch and bound algorithm. This branching heuristic is optimized online with Thompson sampling, which ranks the best graph representations of MIP's structure according to computational speed up over SCIP. We achieve results comparable to state of the art online learning methods. Moreover, our results indicate that our method generalizes well to more general online frameworks, where variations in constraint matrix, constraint vector and objective coefficients can all occur and where more samples are available.</p></details> | 11 pages |
| **[A Conformal Prediction-Based Chance-Constrained Programming Approach for 24/7 Carbon-Free Data Center Operation Scheduling](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04053v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The rapid growth of AI applications is dramatically increasing data center energy demand, exacerbating carbon emissions, and necessitating a shift towards 24/7 carbon-free energy (CFE). Unlike traditional annual energy matching, 24/7 CFE requires matching real-time electricity consumption with clean energy generation every hour, presenting significant challenges due to the inherent variability and forecasting errors of renewable energy sources. Traditional robust and data-driven optimization methods often fail to leverage the features of the prediction model (also known as contextual or covariate information) when constructing the uncertainty set, leading to overly conservative operational decisions. This paper proposes a comprehensive approach for 24/7 CFE data center operation scheduling, focusing on robust decision-making under renewable generation uncertainty. This framework leverages covariate information through a multi-variable conformal prediction (CP) technique to construct statistically valid and adaptive uncertainty sets for renewable forecasts. The uncertainty sets directly inform the chance-constrained programming (CCP) problem, ensuring that chance constraints are met with a specified probability. We further establish theoretical underpinnings connecting the CP-generated uncertainty sets to the statistical feasibility guarantees of the CCP. Numerical results highlight the benefits of this covariate-aware approach, demonstrating up to 6.65% cost reduction and 6.96% decrease in carbon-based energy usage compared to conventional covariate-independent methods, thereby enabling data centers to progress toward 24/7 CEF.</p></details> |  |
| **[A Dynamic Programming Approach to Evader Pathfinding in Static Pursuit Scenarios](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.04050v1)** | 2025-10-05 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The interdiction of escaping adversaries in urban networks is a critical security challenge. State-of-the-art game-theoretic models, such as the Escape Interdiction Game (EIG), provide comprehensive frameworks but assume a highly dynamic interaction and entail significant computational complexity, which can be prohibitive for real-time applications. This paper investigates a crucial sub-problem: an evader's optimal pathfinding calculus when faced with a static or pre-determined defender deployment. We propose the Dynamic Programming for Evader Route Optimization (DPERO) algorithm, which models the environment as a graph with probabilistic risks at various nodes. By transforming the multiplicative survival objective into an additive cost function using logarithms, we frame the task as a shortest path problem solvable with value iteration. This approach allows for the efficient computation of a path that optimally balances safety and distance. Experimental results on simulated grid networks demonstrate that DPERO identifies routes with significantly higher survival probabilities compared to naive shortest-path baselines, validating its efficacy as a practical tool for vulnerability analysis and strategic planning.</p></details> |  |

An analysis of fifty-eight peer-reviewed studies published between 2022 and 2025 identified three primary categories of AI agents: chatbots, generative AI (GenAI), and intelligent tutoring systems (ITS), with GenAI being the most frequently studied. The primary instructional objectives reported include enhanced programming support in 94.83% of studies, motivational and emotional benefits in 18.96%, and increased efficiency for educators in 6.90%. Reported benefits include personalized feedback, improved learning outcomes, and time savings. The review also highlights challenges, such as setup barriers documented in 93.10% of studies, overreliance resulting in superficial learning in 65.52%, and concerns regarding AI errors and academic integrity. These findings suggest the need for instructional frameworks that prioritize the development of prompt engineering skills and human oversight to address these issues. This review provides educators and curriculum designers with an evidence-based foundation for the practical and ethical integration of AI in programming education.</p></details> |  |

Large language models (LLMs) present opportunities to scale such support, though their effectiveness depends on how well technical capabilities are aligned with pedagogical goals. This survey synthesizes recent work on LLM applications in programming education across three focal areas: formative code feedback, assessment, and knowledge modeling. We identify recurring design patterns in how these tools are applied and find that interventions are most effective when educator expertise complements model output through human-in-the-loop oversight, scaffolding, and evaluation. Fully automated approaches are often constrained in capturing the pedagogical nuances of programming education, although human-in-the-loop designs and course specific adaptation offer promising directions for future improvement. Future research should focus on improving transparency, strengthening alignment with pedagogy, and developing systems that flexibly adapt to the needs of varied learning contexts.</p></details> | <details><summary>2025 ...</summary><p>2025 EMNLP HCI+NLP Workshop Short Paper</p></details> |

To help design algorithms that do not rely on precise estimation of sparse nuisance parameters or signal feature set, we establish minimax separation for exact cluster recovery of semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxation of $K$-means using varying subsets of features. It highlights the critical role of feature selection and, at the same time, shows that the signal feature set can be slightly overestimated without compromising clustering performance. Guided by this theory, our method alternates between rough feature selection and clustering: feature selection is performed by thresholding a rough estimate of the discriminative direction, while clustering is carried out via an SDP-relaxed $K$-means. We further extend the method to settings with unknown sparse precision matrices, avoiding full model parameter estimation by computing only the minimally required quantities.</p></details> | <details><summary>123 p...</summary><p>123 pages, 5 figures, 12 tables, 6 algorithms; Main text 24 pages, 2 figures, 2 table, 3 algorithms</p></details> |

We cast two long-standing QMC design problems as program synthesis and solve them with an LLM-guided evolutionary loop that mutates and selects code under task-specific fitness: (i) constructing finite 2D/3D point sets with low star discrepancy, and (ii) choosing Sobol' direction numbers that minimize randomized QMC error on downstream integrands. Our two-phase procedure combines constructive code proposals with iterative numerical refinement. On finite sets, we rediscover known optima in small 2D cases and set new best-known 2D benchmarks for N >= 40, while matching most known 3D optima up to the proven frontier (N <= 8) and reporting improved 3D benchmarks beyond. On digital sequences, evolving Sobol' parameters yields consistent reductions in randomized quasi-Monte Carlo (rQMC) mean-squared error for several 32-dimensional option-pricing tasks relative to widely used Joe--Kuo parameters, while preserving extensibility to any sample size and compatibility with standard randomizations. Taken together, the results demonstrate that LLM-driven evolutionary program synthesis can automate the discovery of high-quality QMC constructions, recovering classical designs where they are optimal and improving them where finite-N structure matters.

| **[REFINE: Enhancing Program Repair Agents through Context-Aware Patch Refinement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03588v1)** | 2025-10-04 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Large Language Models (LLMs) have recently shown strong potential in automatic program repair (APR), especially in repository-level settings where the goal is to generate patches based on natural language issue descriptions, large codebases, and regression tests. However, despite their promise, current LLM-based APR techniques often struggle to produce correct fixes due to limited understanding of code context and over-reliance on incomplete test suites. As a result, they frequently generate Draft Patches-partially correct patches that either incompletely address the bug or overfit to the test cases. In this work, we propose a novel patch refinement framework, Refine, that systematically transforms Draft Patches into correct ones. Refine addresses three key challenges: disambiguating vague issue and code context, diversifying patch candidates through test-time scaling, and aggregating partial fixes via an LLM-powered code review process. We implement Refine as a general refinement module that can be integrated into both open-agent-based and workflow-based APR systems. Our evaluation on the SWE-Bench Lite benchmark shows that Refine achieves state-of-the-art results among workflow-based approaches and approaches the best-known performance across all APR categories. Specifically, Refine boosts AutoCodeRover's performance by 14.67%, achieving a score of 51.67% and surpassing all prior baselines. On SWE-Bench Verified, Refine improves the resolution rate by 12.2%, and when integrated across multiple APR systems, it yields an average improvement of 14%-demonstrating its broad effectiveness and generalizability. These results highlight the effectiveness of refinement as a missing component in current APR pipelines and the potential of agentic collaboration in closing the gap between near-correct and correct patches.

Situated in the tradition of probabilistic program semantics for sequence models, TAD augments modern instruction-tuned systems with a lattice of semantic guards that operate at decode time. Our contributions are fourfold: (i) a constraint-based semantics that renders oracle filtering as a program-logic judgment, (ii) a proof that greedy selection enjoys local likelihood dominance under sound and complete guards (Theorem 2.7), (iii) an entropy-style invariant that quantifies factual risk via knowledge-aware safe mass, and (iv) a multi-agent operational calculus with verified Lean artefacts to certify implementation behaviour. Numerical and algorithmic case studies confirm that the resulting guardrails reduce hallucinations without sacrificing throughput, yielding a pragmatic bridge between large-scale empirical models and formal verification.</p></details> | <details><summary>18 pa...</summary><p>18 pages, Lean code provided</p></details> |

In particular, it allows us to find the relationships between Newton's method, the iterative LQR (iLQR), and Differential Dynamic Programming (DDP) approaches to solve the problem. It is shown that the iLQR is a principled SQP approach, rather than simply an approximation of DDP by neglecting the Hessian terms, to solve optimal control problems that can be guaranteed to always produce a cost-descent direction and converge to an optimum; while Newton's approach or DDP do not have similar guarantees, especially far from an optimum. Our empirical evaluations on the pendulum and cart-pole swing-up tasks serve to corroborate the SQP-based analysis proposed in this paper.</p></details> |  |
| **[Abstain and Validate: A Dual-LLM Policy for Reducing Noise in Agentic Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03217v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Agentic Automated Program Repair (APR) is increasingly tackling complex, repository-level bugs in industry, but ultimately agent-generated patches still need to be reviewed by a human before committing them to ensure they address the bug. Showing unlikely patches to developers can lead to substantial noise, wasting valuable developer time and eroding trust in automated code changes. We introduce two complementary LLM-based policies to reduce such noise: bug abstention and patch validation policies. Bug abstention excludes bugs that the agentic APR system is unlikely to fix. Patch validation rejects patches that are unlikely to be a good fix for the given bug. We evaluate both policies on three sets of bugs from Google's codebase, and their candidate patches generated by an internal agentic APR system. On a set of 174 human-reported bugs, removing bugs and patch trajectories rejected by our policies can raise success rates by up to 13 percentage points and 15 percentage points, respectively, and by up to 39 percentage points in combination. On null pointer exceptions and sanitizer-reported bugs with machine-generated bug reports, patch validation also improves average single-sample success rates. This two-policy approach provides a practical path to the reliable, industrial-scale deployment of agentic APR systems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Hierarchical Knowledge Injection for Improving LLM-based Program Repair](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.24015v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Prompting LLMs with bug-related context (e.g., error messages, stack traces) improves automated program repair, but many bugs still remain unresolved. In real-world projects, developers often rely on broader repository and project-level context beyond the local code to resolve such bugs. In this paper, we investigate how automatically extracting and providing such knowledge can improve LLM-based program repair. We propose a layered knowledge injection framework that incrementally augments LLMs with structured context. It starts with the Bug Knowledge Layer, which includes information such as the buggy function and failing tests; expands to the Repository Knowledge Layer, which adds structural dependencies, related files, and commit history; and finally injects the Project Knowledge Layer, which incorporates relevant details from documentation and previously fixed bugs. We evaluate this framework on a dataset of 314 bugs from BugsInPy using two LLMs (Llama 3.3 and GPT-4o-mini), and analyze fix rates across six bug types. By progressively injecting knowledge across layers, our approach achieves a fix rate of 79% (250/314) using Llama 3.3, a significant improvement of 23% over previous work. All bug types show improvement with the addition of repository-level context, while only a subset benefit further from project-level knowledge, highlighting that different bug types require different levels of contextual information for effective repair. We also analyze the remaining unresolved bugs and find that more complex and structurally isolated bugs, such as Program Anomaly and GUI bugs, remain difficult even after injecting all available information. Our results show that layered context injection improves program repair and suggest the need for interactive and adaptive APR systems.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted at IEEE/ACM Automated Software Engineering (ASE) 2025 Conference</p></details> |

Previous highly visible studies have established associations between certain programming languages and energy consumption. A causal misinterpretation of this work has led academics and industry leaders to use or support certain languages based on their claimed impact on energy consumption. This paper tackles this causal question directly: it develops a detailed causal model capturing the complex relationship between programming language choice and energy consumption. This model identifies and incorporates several critical but previously overlooked factors that affect energy usage. These factors, such as distinguishing programming languages from their implementations, the impact of the application implementations themselves, the number of active cores, and memory activity, can significantly skew energy consumption measurements if not accounted for. We show -- via empirical experiments, improved methodology, and careful examination of anomalies -- that when these factors are controlled for, notable discrepancies in prior work vanish. Our analysis suggests that the choice of programming language implementation has no significant impact on energy consumption beyond execution time.</p></details> | <details><summary>12 pa...</summary><p>12 pages, to appear at ASE'25</p></details> |
| **[Smart Contract Intent Detection with Pre-trained Programming Language Model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.20086v3)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Malicious developer intents in smart contracts constitute significant security threats to decentralized applications, leading to substantial economic losses. To address this, SmartIntentNN was previously introduced as a deep learning model for detecting unsafe developer intents. By combining the Universal Sentence Encoder, a K-means clustering-based intent highlighting mechanism, and a Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (BiLSTM) network, the model achieved an F1 score of 0.8633 on an evaluation set of 10,000 real-world smart contracts across ten distinct intent categories. In this study, we present an enhanced version of this model, SmartIntentNN2 (Smart Contract Intent Neural Network V2). The primary enhancement is the integration of a BERT-based pre-trained programming language model, which we domain-adaptively pre-train on a dataset of 16,000 real-world smart contracts using a Masked Language Modeling objective. SmartIntentNN2 retains the BiLSTM-based multi-label classification network for intent detection. On the same evaluation set of 10,000 smart contracts, SmartIntentNN2 achieves superior performance with an accuracy of 0.9789, precision of 0.9090, recall of 0.9476, and an F1 score of 0.9279, substantially outperforming its predecessor and other baseline models. Notably, SmartIntentNN2 also delivers a 65.5% relative improvement in F1 score over GPT-4.1 on this specialized task. These results establish SmartIntentNN2 as a new state-of-the-art model for smart contract intent detection.</p></details> | <details><summary>11 pa...</summary><p>11 pages, 5 figures, conference</p></details> |
| **[Progressive Bound Strengthening via Doubly Nonnegative Cutting Planes for Nonconvex Quadratic Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02948v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We introduce a cutting-plane framework for nonconvex quadratic programs (QPs) that progressively tightens convex relaxations. Our approach leverages the doubly nonnegative (DNN) relaxation to compute strong lower bounds and generate separating cuts, which are iteratively added to improve the relaxation. We establish that, at any Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) point satisfying a second-order sufficient condition, a valid cut can be obtained by solving a linear semidefinite program (SDP), and we devise a finite-termination local search procedure to identify such points. Extensive computational experiments on both benchmark and synthetic instances demonstrate that our approach yields tighter bounds and consistently outperforms leading commercial and academic solvers in terms of efficiency, robustness, and scalability. Notably, on a standard desktop, our algorithm reduces the relative optimality gap to 0.01% on 138 out of 140 instances of dimension 100 within one hour, without resorting to branch-and-bound.</p></details> |  |
| **[New Limits on Distributed Quantum Advantage: Dequantizing Linear Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.07574v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>In this work, we give two results that put new limits on distributed quantum advantage in the context of the LOCAL model of distributed computing. First, we show that there is no distributed quantum advantage for any linear program. Put otherwise, if there is a quantum-LOCAL algorithm $\mathcal{A}$ that finds an $\alpha$-approximation of some linear optimization problem $\Pi$ in $T$ communication rounds, we can construct a classical, deterministic LOCAL algorithm $\mathcal{A}'$ that finds an $\alpha$-approximation of $\Pi$ in $T$ rounds. As a corollary, all classical lower bounds for linear programs, including the KMW bound, hold verbatim in quantum-LOCAL. Second, using the above result, we show that there exists a locally checkable labeling problem (LCL) for which quantum-LOCAL is strictly weaker than the classical deterministic SLOCAL model. Our results extend from quantum-LOCAL also to finitely dependent and non-signaling distributions, and one of the corollaries of our work is that the non-signaling model and the SLOCAL model are incomparable in the context of LCL problems: By prior work, there exists an LCL problem for which SLOCAL is strictly weaker than the non-signaling model, and our work provides a separation in the opposite direction.</p></details> | <details><summary>Accep...</summary><p>Accepted to DISC 2025</p></details> |
| **[Vibe coding: programming through conversation with artificial intelligence](http://arxiv.org/abs/2506.23253v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>We examine "vibe coding": an emerging programming paradigm where developers primarily write code by interacting with code-generating large language models rather than writing code directly. We present the first empirical study of vibe coding. We analysed over 8 hours of curated video capturing extended vibe coding sessions with rich think-aloud reflections. Using framework analysis, we investigated programmers' goals, workflows, prompting techniques, debugging approaches, and challenges encountered. We find that vibe coding follows iterative goal satisfaction cycles where developers alternate between prompting AI, evaluating generated code through rapid scanning and application testing, and manual editing. Prompts in vibe coding blend vague, high-level directives with detailed technical specifications. Debugging remains a hybrid process combining AI assistance with manual practices. Critically, vibe coding does not eliminate the need for programming expertise but rather redistributes it toward context management, rapid code evaluation, and decisions about when to transition between AI-driven and manual manipulation of code. Trust in AI tools during vibe coding is dynamic and contextual, developed through iterative verification rather than blanket acceptance. Vibe coding is an evolution of AI-assisted programming that represents an early manifestation of "material disengagement", wherein practitioners orchestrate code production and manipulation, mediated through AI, while maintaining selective and strategic oversight.</p></details> | <details><summary>Sarka...</summary><p>Sarkar, A., & Drosos, I.

| **[Automated Repair of OpenID Connect Programs (Extended Version)](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02773v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>OpenID Connect has revolutionized online authentication based on single sign-on (SSO) by providing a secure and convenient method for accessing multiple services with a single set of credentials. Despite its widespread adoption, critical security bugs in OpenID Connect have resulted in significant financial losses and security breaches, highlighting the need for robust mitigation strategies. Automated program repair presents a promising solution for generating candidate patches for OpenID implementations. However, challenges such as domain-specific complexities and the necessity for precise fault localization and patch verification must be addressed. We propose AuthFix, a counterexample-guided repair engine leveraging LLMs for automated OpenID bug fixing. AuthFix integrates three key components: fault localization, patch synthesis, and patch verification. By employing a novel Petri-net-based model checker, AuthFix ensures the correctness of patches by effectively modeling interactions. Our evaluation on a dataset of OpenID bugs demonstrates that AuthFix successfully generated correct patches for 17 out of 23 bugs (74%), with a high proportion of patches semantically equivalent to developer-written fixes.</p></details> | <details><summary>This ...</summary><p>This is an extended version.

| **[EvoSpeak: Large Language Models for Interpretable Genetic Programming-Evolved Heuristics](http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.02686v1)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Genetic programming (GP) has demonstrated strong effectiveness in evolving tree-structured heuristics for complex optimization problems. Yet, in dynamic and large-scale scenarios, the most effective heuristics are often highly complex, hindering interpretability, slowing convergence, and limiting transferability across tasks. To address these challenges, we present EvoSpeak, a novel framework that integrates GP with large language models (LLMs) to enhance the efficiency, transparency, and adaptability of heuristic evolution. EvoSpeak learns from high-quality GP heuristics, extracts knowledge, and leverages this knowledge to (i) generate warm-start populations that accelerate convergence, (ii) translate opaque GP trees into concise natural-language explanations that foster interpretability and trust, and (iii) enable knowledge transfer and preference-aware heuristic generation across related tasks. We verify the effectiveness of EvoSpeak through extensive experiments on dynamic flexible job shop scheduling (DFJSS), under both single- and multi-objective formulations. The results demonstrate that EvoSpeak produces more effective heuristics, improves evolutionary efficiency, and delivers human-readable reports that enhance usability. By coupling the symbolic reasoning power of GP with the interpretative and generative strengths of LLMs, EvoSpeak advances the development of intelligent, transparent, and user-aligned heuristics for real-world optimization problems.</p></details> |  |
| **[Programming with Pixels: Can Computer-Use Agents do Software Engineering?](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.18525v2)** | 2025-10-03 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>Computer-use agents (CUAs) hold the promise of performing a wide variety of general tasks, but current evaluations have primarily focused on simple scenarios. It therefore remains unclear whether such generalist agents can automate more sophisticated and specialized work such as software engineering (SWE). To investigate this, we introduce $\texttt{Programming with Pixels}$ (PwP), the first comprehensive computer-use environment for software engineering, where agents visually control an IDE to perform diverse software engineering tasks. To enable holistic evaluation, we also introduce \texttt{PwP-Bench}, a benchmark of 15 existing and new software-engineering tasks spanning multiple modalities, programming languages, and skillsets. We perform an extensive evaluation of state-of-the-art open-weight and closed-weight CUAs and find that when interacting purely visually, they perform significantly worse than specialized coding agents. However, when the same CUAs are given direct access to just two APIs-file editing and bash operations-performance jumps, often reaching the levels of specialized agents despite having a task-agnostic design. Furthermore, when given access to additional IDE tools via text APIs, all models show further gains. Our analysis shows that current CUAs fall short mainly due to limited visual grounding and the inability to take full advantage of the rich environment, leaving clear room for future improvements.PwP establishes software engineering as a natural domain for benchmarking whether generalist computer-use agents can reach specialist-level performance on sophisticated tasks.

| **[Galley: Modern Query Optimization for Sparse Tensor Programs](http://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14706v5)** | 2025-10-02 | <details><summary>Show</summary><p>The tensor programming abstraction is a foundational paradigm which allows users to write high performance programs via a high-level imperative interface. Recent work on sparse tensor compilers has extended this paradigm to sparse tensors (i.e., tensors where most entries are not explicitly represented). With these systems, users define the semantics of the program and the algorithmic decisions in a concise language that can be compiled to efficient low-level code. However, these systems still require users to make complex decisions about program structure and memory layouts to write efficient programs. This work presents Galley, a system for declarative tensor programming that allows users to write efficient tensor programs without making complex algorithmic decisions. Galley is the first system to perform cost based lowering of sparse tensor algebra to the imperative language of sparse tensor compilers, and the first to optimize arbitrary operators beyond sum and product. First, it decomposes the input program into a sequence of aggregation steps through a novel extension of the FAQ framework. Second, Galley optimizes and converts each aggregation step to a concrete program, which is compiled and executed with a sparse tensor compiler. We show that Galley produces programs that are 1-300x faster than competing methods for machine learning over joins and 5-20x faster than a state-of-the-art relational database for subgraph counting workloads with a minimal optimization overhead.</p></details> |  |
